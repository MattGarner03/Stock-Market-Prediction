===== 2025 Q3  (2025-04-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2025 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Also, please note this conference call is being recorded. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Let me hand the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell, for a brief introduction of Sally Schwartz, who recently joined the company as Chief Relations Officer. Mick Farrell, please go ahead.
Mick Farrell: Thank you, Kevin. I'm very excited to have Sally join the ResMed team. Our newest ResMedian. She joined us earlier this week and brings more than two decades of experience across capital markets, health care, and technology. We look forward to Sally helping us to take investor relations to the next level. Here at ResMed, providing clarity, transparency, and long-term alignment amongst current and future investors and all of our stakeholders. So, Sally, we're thrilled to have you on board.
Sally Schwartz: Thanks, Mick. I'm happy to be here, and I look forward to meeting our investors very soon. But first, I want to welcome our listeners to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thank you, Sally, and good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to folks from Asia here in North America and those in Europe as we welcome our shareholders around the world and review results for our third quarter of fiscal year 2025. I'm excited to report that ResMed delivered another strong quarter, achieving excellent top-line and bottom-line results. We delivered solid revenue growth, gross margin expansion both sequentially and year on year, very strong free cash flow generation, and maintained our disciplined approach to investments in both research and development and SG&A. This performance reflects broad-based momentum and disciplined execution to capture growing demand for our products. Our continued success is driven by our market-leading value proposition, top-quality software products, as well as our expansive digital health software ecosystem. With cloud-connected devices, digital health platforms, and investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, as well as generative AI technology. Our results are a testament to the work that we do to enhance sleep health, breathing health, and health care delivery in the home. Thanks to the over ten thousand ResMedians who make that happen in over one hundred and forty countries worldwide. As the global leader in helping patients with chronic respiratory conditions, we are closely monitoring the evolving global trade environment, particularly in the area of tariffs. In my current role as a board member at AdvoMed, and the current chair of the international committee on the AdvoMed board, we will continue to urge countries around the world to exempt all medical devices from tariffs on a humanitarian basis. For us here at ResMed, the news is even better. I can report that because of the fact that our products are used to treat patients with chronic respiratory conditions that have been subject to global tariff relief for decades. We have reaffirmed that that is the case with federal authorities just this month in the current setting. In short, ResMed is very well positioned with exemptions in place for our products that are used to treat sleep apnea, and respiratory insufficiency, as well as other chronic respiratory conditions. In terms of ResMed's inherent strengths, about performing our competitors with prior externalities such as the COVID crisis, the supply chain crisis, and our ability to ramp up to meet the needs when our competitors simply could not, I will say that our exceptionally strong balance sheet, and our net cash position, our global scale, our accelerating operational efficiency, as well as ongoing cost discipline gives us the confidence to not just survive, but to thrive whatever the market may bring. ResMed is all about stability and balance in times like this. Ultimately, we're committed to making sure that sleep therapy, breathing therapy, and health care technology that's delivered in the home is both accessible and affordable, as well as ensuring that the delivery of our solutions is consistently available for our patients, for our providers, and all of the health care partners in our global ecosystem. Our Sydney-based and Singapore-based facilities continue to be the core of our manufacturing leadership globally. In addition to that, we will soon open our newest manufacturing location in Calabasas, California. This will double the size of our current manufacturing footprint in the United States of America, serving as the hub of our research and development for our motor technology, increasing the manufacturing capacity of core motor technology even closer to our largest market here in the US, and expanding manufacturing of silicone mask cushions leveraging advanced molding technology that ResMed leads the world in. This facility is designed to scale over the coming years with multiple mask molding cells and more growth as mask manufacturing increases to meet growing US and global demand. And I can tell you, these factories are very automated and very high-tech. We're also investing in getting our products to our home care providers even more efficiently here in the United States. Our largest distribution facility worldwide is our five hundred and twenty-two thousand square foot campus in Atlanta, Georgia. We also have a West Coast facility just up the road from us here up in Moreno Valley, California. Over half of our global research and development investment is now US-based. With tenfold growth in American R&D over this last decade. These investments reflect our leadership, our economic development focus, and the health care impact that we have as ResMed right here in the US. Where we have our global headquarters and where we support our largest global market. The US domestic market. ResMed is an innovation machine. And our ongoing investments of over six percent to seven of revenues into research and development is a key growth driver of our long term I'm proud that we have been recognized for these market-leading efforts as we were named in the Lexus Nexus list of the top one hundred global innovators. This award is given to market-leading companies that are driving pioneering innovation in the global economy. We continue to introduce new technology to our customers in the third quarter because it's nice to get awards. But as my father, the founder of ResMed says, innovation is when customers actually pay for it. This quarter marked the first full commercial rollout of Nite Owl, in the United States. Night Owl is a fingertip-sized home sleep apnea test that is being used by physicians, sleep labs, as well as independent diagnostic and testing facilities. Known as IDTFs to diagnose patients. Widespread adoption of our night owl product will help more efficiently move patients through the screening and diagnostic funnel so that physicians can then write prescriptions and home care providers can then set up those patients on therapy and take care of them for life. In addition to the nationwide launch of Nite Owl, we're providing our sleep lab partners with even more new technology this quarter. On April fifteen, we launched the AirSense eleven version of ZPAP Tx. VPAP TX is our sleep lab testing and titration platform. Built specifically for both hospital as well as outpatient sleep lab environment. VPAP TX is purpose-built to support everything that a sleep physician needs in the sleep lab, including titration, evaluation, and setup across every therapy mode that ResMed offers. Including CPAP, APAP, bilevel s, bilevel s t, as well as adaptive servo ventilation, also known as ASV therapy. Vpap TX gives physicians gives RPSG, text, and respiratory therapists a powerful new tool to personalize the gold standard positive airway pressure treatment decisions and ultimately to accelerate adoption of long-term therapy for their patients through personalization of that therapy. The vPAP TX platform is built for flexibility, for precision, and for clinical confidence. When we pair Nite Owl and Vpap TX with AirView, our cloud-based software for physicians and home care providers, they become part of a complete connected pathway from diagnosis and titration to prescription and ultimately therapy adherence. Of course, we are working to incorporate diagnostic insights from Nite Owl into our MyAir patient app. And to incorporate diagnostic data from both Nite Owl and vPAP TX into Somnawhere. Somnawhere, our software for physicians and sleep physicians practices, continues to grow in its reach and has been adopted by one of the largest private healthcare systems in the United States. As well as being further expanded within the US Veterans Administration. Or VA. Our investments in testing devices, and diagnostic tracking software, which benefits potential patients, sleep labs, and our home care providers, demonstrate ResMed's depth of commitment to the entire sleep health and breathing health ecosystems that provides access to the market-leading sleep apnea therapy. And that's from ResMed. We will continue to invest in our digital health ecosystem to help expand the diagnostic funnel to keep up with expanding new patient flow from both our own demand generation, demand capture investments, as well as capturing demand from two powerful macro trends. One, the widespread adoption of GLP one medications both in the US and worldwide, and two, accelerating momentum in consumer wearable. For consumers coming into the funnel from all of these areas, ResMed will be known as the company answering their questions about sleep health. I call this concept a digital sleep health concierge capability, including screening protocols, clinical tools, seamless workflows, and cloud-connected care path ResMed is the leading global brand in the field of sleep health, and breathing health. We want to expand the reach of that brand to help the more than two point three billion people that need our help for their sleep apnea, as I call it sleep suffocation, their insomnia, inability to get to sleep, stay asleep, or their respiratory insufficiency. Due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. During the quarter, we announced a comprehensive ResMed brand evolution strategy designed to unify our global brand portfolio into one. Across sleep health, breathing health, and health care technology that is delivered into the home. We will continue to build ResMed brand awareness and evolve our brand to be closer to each and every custom. However, I wanna make it clear that our marketing team will make certain that there is a positive return on investment. Or ROI for every single demand generation demand capture, and demand conversion project that we launch. As we move more and more people into the diagnostics, and treatment funnel, When we talk about ResMed brand development, please know that internally, that means ResMed brand ROI as well. An example of our disciplined demand generation experimentation is shown in our latest effort to educate physicians. We have launched a targeted demand generation program through continual medical education also called CME programs, to help teach physicians the benefits of CPAP APAP, and bilevel therapies for their patients. These targeted education efforts are having an impact with measurably increased prescriptions from those physicians. In addition to physician education, we're also reaching out to consumers looking for what we call sleep health concerned consumers. On this front, I'm happy to say that our experiments on streaming advertising in select cities have resulted in significant increases in patient flow into the screening and diagnostic funnel. It remains early days with these first cities but we are seeing an openness in consumers to messaging, that helps them find relief from their sleep apnea or sleep suffocation and their lack of good quality of sleep that could be insomnia. We're also continuing to build long-term value across our existing patient base. To keep patients on therapy for their own personal health. And for the good of the whole healthcare ecosystem. Research shows that patients who are enrolled in a compliant world-class resupply program are more likely to stay adherent to our therapy over the long term, and therefore, to have better health outcomes. With the provision of just one additional item, per patient per year achieved by more efficient outreach we believe we can provide exceptional value to our home care provider customers and make sure that our patients have access to new, clean masks and accessories for better care and better outcomes for them and for their physicians. Our focus is on driving increased patient adherence improving outcomes, Programs like Brightree Connect resupply complete, and resupply essentials that are available for HME customers on any of their EHRs and ERPs they may use. Combined with personalized engagement through MyAir, are delivering strong results with home care providers right here in the United States. We have the opportunity to adapt and scale these types of resupply and adherence technologies globally to the hundred and forty countries ultimately that ResMed is able to deliver care in. Keeping patients on therapy is our moral imperative, our obligation here at Res and it's firmly supported by scientific research. During the quarter, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Medical Journal published a landmark meta-analysis. And a meta-analysis has a higher clinical value than a randomized controlled trial or RCT that many people have can have considered looked at as the gold standard for clinical trials. So in short, the Lancet publication showed that CPAP therapy reduces all-cause mortality by thirty-seven percent. It reduces overall death rates by thirty-seven percent. And further, that study went on to say that CPAP therapy reduces cardiovascular mortality by fifty-five percent. So CPAP reduces cardiovascular death rates by fifty-five percent. And this study wasn't small. This meta-analysis included over one million participants. So here at ResMed, we've known for decades that CPAP improves quality of life for sleep apnea patients. We've talked internally about these improvements in cardiovascular and more mortality health, but now we have proof that it helps people to ultimately live longer and to live better. These data show that CPAP is not just another medical therapy. It's literally a case of life and death. So here at ResMed, we make the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most cloud-connected and most intelligent therapies for sleep apnea, insomnia, and respiratory insufficiency. We also have the market-leading software for health care technology that is delivered right where people wanna be, which is in their own home. With home medical equipment, home health, home nurse and software that's beyond. To our shareholders around the world, we are building on our ResMed foundation with our long-term leadership in our global markets. We now serve approximately And we remain on track toward our ambitious goal of improving five hundred million people's lives in twenty thirty. Half a billion worldwide. This quarter's results show the strength of our strategy, our investment in R&D, the clarity of our execution, and the scale of our impact. We launched a renewed and refreshed brand, we scaled digital diagnostics and titration tools. We expanded intelligent therapy. We activated new patients, And really importantly, we replenish supplies for existing patients worldwide. And while doing all of this, we also delivered very strong financial results with top-line growth and leverage down to the bottom line. I'd say this, We're just getting started. So thank you to every one of the ten thousand WestMedians around the world who made that possible and will make it possible our future growth. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Brett who's in Sydney today, for a deeper dive into our financials, and then we'll open the floor up for questions. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.29 billion, an 8% headline increase and 9% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $13 million during the March quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our residential care software business, sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Globally on a constant currency basis, device sales increased by 7% while masks and other sales increased by 12%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 6%. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting continued growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia, and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. While masks and other sales increased by 7% on a constant currency basis. Residential care software revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis in the March quarter underpinned by strong performance from our Medifox DAN software vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 59.9% in the March quarter. Year-over-year increase was primarily driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiencies, as well as favorable shifts in product mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin increased by 70 basis points primarily driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiency. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives and we are focused on making sustained long-term gross margin improvements. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect our gross margin in Q4 FY2025, to be broadly consistent with our third quarter gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 7% on a headline basis and by 8% on a constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly due to increases in employee-related expenses, and increases in marketing expenses, including costs associated with our recent global brand launch and demand generation activities. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19% compared to 19.2% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 9% on a headline basis and by 11% on a constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.5%, compared to 6.4% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our net interest income for the quarter was $1 million. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.1% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the March quarter was 12.6% as we recorded a net income tax benefit of $30 million relating to interest on our tax refunds from the IRS. We have treated this tax benefit as a non-GAAP item in our third quarter financial results. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 11% with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.37 also increased by 11%. Excluding the impact of investment portfolio write-downs in Q3, totaling $6 million, earnings per share for the March quarter was $2.41, an increase of 13% over the prior year period. I would like to comment on the expected impact of US tariffs particularly associated with the introduction of a 10% tariff on exports to the US from Australia and Singapore. These locations are where we currently manufacture most of our devices and masks for the US market. We have, for many years, been importing our products under a chapter of the harmonized tariff schedule of the United States, that governs importation of certain medical devices, including equipment, treat sleep apnea and other chronic respiratory conditions. We've worked hard over the years to achieve that status and to maintain it for products we sell in the United States. As a result, we have historically paid negligible duties or tariffs on the importation of most of our products. On April 5, US Customs and Border Protection issued a notice of implementation confirming that current tariff treatment of our products like ours continues. Accordingly, we do not expect the introduction of US tariffs to have a material impact on our financial results. We also continue to improve the resilience of our global supply chain by expanding our manufacturing footprint in the US. We expect to open our $30 million advanced manufacturing facility in Calabasas, California in June 2025. This high-tech facility will almost double our manufacturing footprint compared to the existing footprint in our Chatsworth, California facility. Over time, it will significantly expand our production capacity in mass resupply for the United States. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $579 million. This does include a refund of tax and interest from the IRS of $107 million. Excluding the impact of the tax refund, our operating cash flow was $472 million for the quarter. Reflecting strong operating results and lower working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $933 million. On March 31, we had $675 million in gross debt, and $258 million in net cash. And we have $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position with robust operating cash flows and a strong balance sheet, are well positioned to weather the current global uncertainty and respond to geopolitical challenges. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. During the March quarter, we purchased 314,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $75 million. We plan to increase our ongoing share buyback program and purchase shares to the value of approximately $100 million per quarter commencing in Q4 FY2025. This will comfortably more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees, during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions, and continue our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Sally. Thank you.
Sally Schwartz: I'll turn the call over to our operator, Kevin, to provide instructions.
Operator: Thank you. We are now conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like Our first question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Hey. Good morning, Mick, Brett, and welcome, Sally. Can I start with gross margin? Obviously, very strong gross margin expansion there. Can you talk us through in terms of each of the factors that attributed to the expansion? How much of it was driven by each?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Let's start off on that.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Look, as I said in prepared remarks, the big driver was manufacturing and distribution efficiencies. So if you look through that, and these were all meaningful contributions. It's not just one factor. So we had, if you like, manufacturing efficiencies or better recoveries through the factories. Distribution and freight, we're seeing improvements there coming through. The AS ten to AS eleven transition to that platform continues, and we see some benefit with that as well. And then component costs as well are actually starting to contribute to that gross margin expansion as well. So those factors were all meaningful in terms of manufacturing and distribution efficiencies. And the other one was product mix. Year on year as well with that. The mask growth relative to device growth, we saw some favorable or positive product mix as well. And those were the key drivers of the margin expansion.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, good morning, everyone. Sally, good to meet over the phone. Maybe a bigger picture question for a second. You know, certainly on the short term, we've heard that sleep labs are facing a backlog of patients. So it would be curious if that's gotten better or worse. But you know, as we connect that concept with the series of investments, Mick, that you talked about pre and post-diagnosis of sleep apnea, I'm curious what metrics you guys are tracking for these investments and when they should start to show up and results more meaningfully. I'm just trying to compare it to other, you know, growth factors that you guys did do. For example, resupply services that you provided in the past? Is this better, worse, you know, slower, faster, you know, anything that you could provide?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Margaret. It's a great question and allows us to talk pretty broadly about demand generation, demand capture, demand curation, and ultimately getting more of the over one billion people worldwide who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. Onto therapy, sleep suffocation. Onto therapy. Yeah. As you mentioned, as I discussed in the prepared remarks, the launch of Nite Owl, a fingertip-sized, home sleep apnea test should inspire the market. And, you know, I encourage the other players in diagnostics to make smaller and more dynamic and capable because the sleep lab backlogs are at all-time highs. We track the metrics of how long a patient waits from a referral to a diagnostic, and we've got really deep metrics on that for both in-lab and home sleep apnea testing. I can tell you this, that during that COVID emergency, everyone embraced telehealth. Everyone embraced digital health, and we saw almost every sleep lab around the world embrace home sleep apnea testing as well. So we think that combination of us bringing Nite Owl and making it available to everyone, Sleep Labs, IDTFs, care physicians across the board, and empowering the sleep labs to take care of the toughest patients, the patients with overlap syndrome, where you have obstructive sleep apnea plus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. You have diseased lungs and an obstructed upper airway. And the gold standard therapy for that is a bilevel s or ST or even STA. And if you don't have the right titration equipment, you may not be able to get the patient through. And if you have too many patients clogging up the beds, you don't get access to them. So that combination of night owl for those who screen for, you know, likely would have sleep apnea, and then making sure the sleep lab beds have the PAP GXs in them so they can get a CPAP, an APAP, a bilevel s STSTA, or if they have complex sleep apnea, an adaptive server vent lighter. Such as our market-leading ASV. And so, yeah, it's that combination. So what metrics are we tracking, Margaret? We're tracking that time to titration, time to test, TTT. And we're also tracking time from that titration or test through to therapy onset. And, you know, what if there's any churn, what is the churn in terms of patients dropping out? From referral to diagnostic and from diagnostic to therapy and then from therapy setup? To first thirty days, first ninety days, first one year, and then for life. Because as you know, we don't have a cure here. We have a treatment for life, and ResMed's goal is laser-focused on that, overlapping if you like, altruism of the patient has a better outcome, lower chance of death, as we talked about through that landmark study in Lancet, and our ecosystem are able to overlap that altruism with some profit motive and be able to have that resupply be profitable for the channel that allows us to then have revenue to reinvest into R&D, which we do at six, seven percent of the revenue that we have. So great question, Margaret. It's a complex one. We're tracking many metrics there. The ones we'll go public with are probably around the lines of, are we seeing a bend in that curve? Are we having less of a backlog? Are we getting more patients into the lab? And are we seeing an expansion of home sleep apnea testing from both pharma referrals and GLP one, consumer tech, as well as ResMed's own consumer demand generation. So we'll continue to update you as we go forward here. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
Operator: Thank you. Next question. Is coming from Suraj Kalia from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Hi, Mick and Jean. Just I guess a question on your share buybacks. You've increased the amount of debt to a hundred million, and you've done about seventy-five million a quarter just last. Could you talk to the confidence in doing that in light of the demand environment you're seeing, just given some of the uncertainty now with tariffs as an example? And then also just related to that, the thought about capital allocation between buybacks and M&A given the evaluation sort of recess we've seen in the public markets.
Mick Farrell: So I'll go first and then I'll hand over to Brett. Actually, Brett, why don't you go first on the increase in the share buyback? Because going from, you know, three hundred million a year to four hundred million a year, I think is a good step up. There's obviously no artificial limit. Our board, my fellow board of directors and I are very supportive where it's accretive. To give cash back to shareholders. You've seen that in our long-running dividend program. It's been up and share buybacks are an efficient way to give cash back to shareholders. We've shown that in the past and where it's accretive to us. So I think we'll continue to do that. You saw that in Brett's prepared remarks. So Brett, why don't you address that first? And then I'll talk a little bit about other uses for capital, particularly around M&A, tuck-ins, and things like that.
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. And then overall, we're looking to balance that. It'll be around dividends. It'll be buyback. It'll be tuck-in acquisitions, and Mick will talk about that in a little while. So we want to get that balance right, but at the moment, how we see it is we've got very strong operating cash flows and a very robust business. We have we're net cash position on the balance sheet, so we've got an exceptionally strong balance sheet as well. So the board and management feel very confident of upticking that buyback seventy-five million to one hundred million a quarter. That it is an accretive buyback. And I think overall with I feel that that sort of gets the balance right in terms of capital allocation buying back stock there. So we've upticked that. And we feel confident to do that.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. And I'll just add fully in line with Brett there, you know, use of capital, dividends, share buyback, Actually, the best investment is investing back in the business which we do at sixty-seven percent back in the R&D and, you know, nineteen to twenty percent there in SG&A. But look, you know, the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. Obviously, we're generating incredible free cash flow, five hundred and fifty-eight million for the quarter. One point six billion of free cash flow in the trailing twelve months. But we do look at M&A as an interesting area to, you know, accelerate our growth towards our twenty thirty strategy. So as we look at M&A, we're looking at tuck-ins sort of, you know, sub ten percent, sub five percent even of our market cap. Sub one percent, I'd call a definite tuck-in. There are a number on our radar screen. Nothing to announce here on this earnings call. It may not be too far before we announce something. We are actively out there. But I'll say this, the acquisitions that we look at have to meet three criteria. Number one, they're in line with our twenty, thirty strategy. That they're gonna help us be the world leader in sleep health, breathing health, and health care technology delivered at home. The financials have to be there. That's being ROI. It has to get the ROIC to the whack at an appropriate period of time. We have to have free cash flow. We have to be the best owner of that asset. We have to be a better owner of the asset than the current owner. In terms of expanding it globally, expanding it around the US and expanding to all hundred and forty countries we're in. And thirdly, it's gotta be a cultural fit. Gotta be aligned with ResMed's ethics, integrity, doing the right thing when no one's watching. And beyond. So watch this space. Nothing to report, but I'm really excited to be upping the share buyback and watch this space for the tuck-in M&A over the coming, you know, six, twelve months.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks for coming to sit here this afternoon. I hope everyone's doing well. Maybe a question, Mick, just on you know, we're now into the fourth or fifth month here where we have GLP ones in the marketplace. Lilly, you know, was out there sort of indicating that it was pushing at the primary care physician level. So just an update on the state of the state as it relates to where GLP ones are at the moment. And if you can opine on, you know, will this out of the gate actually open up the new patient funnel for CPAP as we think it will based on our channel checks? Thanks again.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Cindy. Thanks for the question. It's a really good one. It's linked to that strategic question around demand generation. How do we get to the billion worldwide? How do we get to the seventy plus million in the US who are suffocating? Where GLP ones are rolling out the fastest. And this Yeah. Look, Lily, you know, with Lily Direct and a lot of this sort of work that they do around the GLP ones and diabetes, obesity, and now with their new IF for sleep apnea are investing in this space. They're not driving that sort of direct d two c campaign yet. Around sleep apnea. We believe they'd probably start that six months post a few somewhere between six and twelve months. So we'll watch the space on that, but we're not waiting for them. As you heard in my prep remarks, we're doing CME education. And we're going directly to high volume GLP one providers. We're going to primary care physicians who they will target so that they're educated and that they understand the gold standard treatment, CPAP, APAP, bile that you can get ninety-five to ninety-nine percent reduction in HR with the gold standard. Right? All the clinical data, all the clinical literature. Interesting. It's not even branded resonate. CME can't. But we did those experiments because it's right. For those doctors to know and it's right to educate them on gold standard and how it can be used in combination with other therapies like pharmaceuticals and dental and other alternatives as well. And so we're very open on that. We track that education to say, well, did we see change in referral rates or prescription rates through to sleep labs and IDTFs and into the funnel? And the answer is yes. We did see it. And so as I said earlier, we'll do grand development and demand generation, but it has to have an ROI. So early days that ResMed's own demand generation capturing, curation elements are working, and they are working not just in our traditional channels and a consumer, but they're working at primary care physicians. At PCPs. And as we've said earlier, we're not gonna target, you know, the three hundred thousand plus PCPs around. We're gonna look at the ten percent that are high volume GLP one. We're gonna look at the portion of them that already had existing relationships with IDTS or Sleep Labs. And so we are working. We are seeing some movement to your question of, you know, how materially will it open up the new patient funnel and how fast will they go. Well, ResMed's got a lot of models. We're investing a lot, and obviously, that's pretty proprietary. But I can tell you that, as I said in the prep remarks, there's an ROI here. You know, the cactus is the LTV works. And so our goal is to scale it appropriately city by city, region by region, doctor by doctor. This is a very personal care. Patients take their sleep apnea care very personally and having a really good relationship with both their primary care physician and their sleep physician is really important to ResMed. We're supporting all of our channels in driving this demand gen. So great question, Anthony, and we'll continue to update you every quarter as to how this is going with demand gen, demand capture, and demand curation.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, I'm gonna stay on the same topic. I mean, I look at the device growth in this quarter, and I know a quarter's a fairly short period, but we've seen a little bit of slowing. I heard the commentary that Sleep Lab's backlogs are, you know, bigger than ever. And then I see ResMed investing in night owl and focusing on, you know, perhaps a little bit more attention on the diagnosis channel. Can I get you to talk a little bit as to, you know, where you think market growth is? Yeah. How much of a headwind or how much of a challenge the backlog in SleepLabs is and what ResMed's doing about it. Please.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Absolutely, David. Well, look, you've followed us for over a decade and so you know over that time that, we're sort of back to that traditional seasonality that we saw here in terms of growth sequentially versus, you know, getting back to what we sort of have always had in the twenty-five years I've been at the company, which is, you know, high deductible health plans, health savings accounts, run through December, and then a bit of a reset in March. But I can tell you US device growth at plus percent US mask growth at plus fourteen percent, pretty darn solid numbers. Yeah. David, look, it's very consistent with where we were last quarter, last five quarters, the last ten quarters where we said the actual market growth rate is mid-single digits on devices. High single digits on masks, and that's if ResMed just accepts market growth. It sits back and lets just suffocating people, their bed father's hearing them, storing, push them into the channel. We're not gonna sit back and do that. It's not how we operate. We're going out there doing demand gen, doing these tests, and getting things going. And so that's how we're beating what market growth would be. At mid-single digits and high single digits on devices and masks respectively. At your point, you know, going back to a normal seasonality, that means we get the benefits of sprinting through to the December quarter too, right, as we go forward through this calendar year. And ResMed's looking at ways to do that. To your point, yeah, we're looking at that backlog. We're looking at patients wanting to come through the channel. And we're looking at repap opportunities and resupply programs. So it's not just about new patients. Particularly on our masks and accessory side. It's really about driving bright tree resupply getting what we used to call snap technology, but now calling resupply complete, resupply essentials out to every HME. That is adaptable to a cloud-based tech like that. I can tell you that their opportunities are huge and that we've got good tests that show we can get an ROI. You know, as I've said before, I think we can accelerate above market growth by fifty, seventy-five, a hundred, maybe even a hundred and twenty-five basis points. Over that mid-single digit growth. Prices and high single digit growth of masks as we get more and more effective at this demand gen, demand capture, and curation. We're not doing it alone. We partner with the primary care physicians. We're partnering with the sleep physicians. We're partnering with doctors. And we're partnering with our HME partners. One note I'll say just on final answer to this question is, you know, we did this sort of direct to consumer empowerment in this last quarter and noting that on those sort of, you know, not late-night television, all that sort of stuff, but some of our competing technologies are doing, but really focus social media and streaming where we know and have already prescreened that this is a high probability candidate for being a sleep health concern consumer somebody has a propensity, we're seeing them follow through and get referrals to primary care and to sleep physicians. And so we are gonna be able to move on all these channels. Traditional sleep lab home sleep apnea testing that they use and PCPs use, and moving consumers into the channel. If we get any upside from the pharma and consumer wearable side, it'll be in addition to our efforts. But we're taking the bull by the horns here. We're driving the demand gen ourselves primarily. Thanks for the question, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for Brett. Brett, you comment on the gross margin into the fourth quarter being sort of broadly consistent with this quarter. Just based on where the euro is now and also that the Aussie dollar was a bit softer in the third quarter, just wondering why your gross margin is not gonna actually be materially higher in Q4 just based on those FX rates. Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Saul. Well, yeah, I mean, I've gone with broadly consistent that if you look at that margin, I guess that gives you a bit of room either side. And you're right. I believe we'll get some FX benefit if the euro stays where it is. Going into Q4. So, you know, I'll be the bias to that is north of what we printed in Q3.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquis. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Good day. Sorry, it's Dan Hurren here playing the role of Andrew Goodsell. We've had a few phone problems. Look, I just wanted to go back to the tariff. Look, I understand that you've confirmed the exemption, but I was just wondering if that exemption will apply or extend to all CPAP and therapy coming into the US? Because we had heard that one of your competitor sales reps is saying that they're pulling a couple of their Chinese-made products on the back of this.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Dan. Look. Really good question. So look. This tariffs work that we've been doing here at ResMed has gone back a long way. And if you look at the history of this, it was nineteen eighty-two that this legislation was first put in place by the Reagan administration. It was reaffirmed in nineteen eighty-nine under H.W. Bush. And then in two thousand nine, ResMed actively worked with CBP. Is the Customs and Border Protection to get official recommendation for us to be with some tariffs at the time then in two thousand eight, nine. That we're looking at being put in play. And we were given a full tariff exemption then. We went back here in twenty twenty-five just earlier, as you heard from Brett, just earlier this month and got reaffirmation that from Customs and Border Protection that our tariff exemptions apply under this protocol. So sometimes called the Nairobi protocol. And we're fully there. As per our competitors, particularly coming from hotbed countries where tariffs are in the triple digit, I would ask you to go talk to them to speculate on that. I think it'll be very different for players. You know, we're coming in from Australia and Singapore. Two very friendly US nations that have longstanding relationships and very good approaches, you know, for those coming from China or Mexico or beyond. I think you've got to ask them and see where they're at. But, yeah, we've been at this for decades, and we reaffirmed it just days ago and we're running with it, and it's going to stay that way. I don't see anything changing on that. And if it does, we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet in all the other elements that we talked about earlier. But right now, you know, we are running through the tape and doing what we do, taking care of patients. And, you know, we're a US headquartered company. These reinvestments in Calabasas in our distribution center Atlanta, Georgia. We're looking at expanding our distribution here. So really strong relationship with the US government, really strong relationship with the Australian government and the Singapore government. And those sort of public-private partnerships that were tested during COVID ResMed stepped up, and I think we've got really good relationships. I love being on the board of Advomed and having the chance to go to Washington DC, to Brussels, to Canberra, to Beijing, and talk to these folks. I'm actually the chair-elect of Avomed, which means on January one twenty twenty-six, I take over chair of the Avomed group. And so I'll be leading the industry. Actually asking for tariff exemptions for medtech, because I think it's the right thing to do. I don't need to beat competitors with a short-term advantage. I beat them anyway. And we'll fight to do those as the right thing on a humanitarian basis. But for right now, we have our tariff exemptions in place, the ones we've had for decades. We affirm just weeks ago. Thanks for the question, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Mick, I actually want to follow-up on that. You have this unique position with Avomed and you know, it is great to see the Nairobi protocol still in place for your product. But I guess I was wondering, have you had any discussions or back and forth with folks in the government about broader exemptions for med tech? What do you think the chances are for that to be broader than just the historical harmonized tariff schedule under the current regime?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Matt, look it's a really good question and I you know as I was saying refer those specific country questions to my competitors. This one, I'd actually defer to the CEO of Avomed, who's Scott Whittaker, who is the one negotiating directly with the White House and obviously So As I said, our goal there at Avomed is a zero for zero and a med tech exemption. We haven't seen progress in that as yet. You know, I've seen a number of my medtech peer CEOs reporting, and some of them are talking about quantifying their specific tariff hit they're gonna have, and those are there for them. They're not there for us. We've been able to have this and reaffirmed it. I will still I'll take the high road. The whole industry and advocate for that. The probability of success I'll leave that up to you, Matt, and your, you know, amazing sell-side folks to run your model on that. But here at ResMed, without business, we're looking very good right now and we're just powering through this. I think our experience of going through Global Financial crisis, COVID crisis, supply chain crisis, our competitor out, and we had to ramp up to the, you know, global manufacturing, Singapore, Sydney, and Atlanta to where we are now. Has given us a lot of sort of stability and balance And I would say, you know, balance in the boat and a stoic nature for our company. We're gonna get through this stronger and better than ever, as I said earlier, not just survive. We're gonna thrive in environment. Challenges are challenges, but they bring opportunities. For people who are ready. Yeah. You know? And opportunities is the overlap of, you know, everyone says it's luck when you get opportunities. And, yeah, there's return on but opportunity is the overlap of there's nothing there and the preparedness of the company. ResMed is very well prepared. Thanks for the question, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Next question. Is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.
Steve Wheen: Yeah. Thanks very much. Question for Brett. Just picking up again on the gross margin. You've obviously got a lot of those factors that you've been talking to for some time. Or pulling in the right direction at the moment. I'm just wondering what sort of runway you've got left to maybe be able to take that gross margin ignoring your comments on FX for the moment, above sixty percent. So just trying to understand whether or not there's further shifts to c freights and if there's further manufacturing efficiencies or maybe even a procurement going you know, that is that is an opportunity in the future.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure, Steve. I mean, we're fifty-nine point nine percent, so we're shy. We're almost at sixty percent now, and we did see some pretty strong sequential increase in the gym as well, two to Q3. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do we're working on a number of initiatives. What we're really focusing on is building a good pipeline of margin improvement initiatives that we can roll out, not just for a quarter, but sustainably take a six-month, twelve-month twenty-four-month view on what we're doing and if we build that pipeline of opportunities and then we execute on those, then that should deliver those margin improvements year in, year out. So the areas we focused on, probably the areas I mentioned, right, is improving your manufacturing efficiencies and recoveries, distribution and freight. And we've made a lot of progress there. So we've got that opportunity, I guess, is less now than it was because we made a lot of progress, but this still opportunity there to optimize on that. We're still running the AS ten and AS eleven platform. We are transitioning, so every quarter, we moving more closer and closer to AS eleven predominantly. Although, there will be a long tail in some markets on AS ten, and it's still pretty popular product in the market. But that will help us. And then on procurement, components, designed for manufacture for new products, for example, that come through some of the work that we might do in terms of, like, you know, life cycle engineering and how we improve the products in market as well. There's a number of opportunities we're looking at. It's not just one and it's not kind of here's one and that's easy and there you go. There's margin improvement. But if you work on a number of items, given our scale, we will get benefit and we'll get improvement in the gross margin that's certainly what our supply chain team is focused on delivering. And how do you do that? You do that by having a really solid long-term pipeline of opportunities as long as you're identifying them and executing on those. Then I'm confident we can continue to expand the gross margin and, you know, get that gross margin. I mean, our aim is to continue to improve it, and that would logically mean it has to end up in the sixties.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Yes, thanks. Hi, Mick. Just interested in your latest thoughts on recent rates for people who've or I would say patients who've initiated GLP one therapy. Just wanted to test the thinking that, you know, patients who lose weight after being on a GLP one might cease their CPAP therapy. It's something that sort of comes in conversations, but interested to hear how you think that might evolve over time and then maybe sort of reflecting or referencing some of the patient engagement initiatives you've got. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, David, it's a really good question. And you know, as you know, we don't just hypothesize on this. We go and collect data. Right? And so we're now tracking over a million patients and we see that high start rate on CPAP therapy for a GLP one prescribed patient plus a PAP prescription. We see that higher reimbursement rate at one year, and we see a higher reimbursement and so plus ten, plus three, plus five. And we're tracking that and really consistent. Every quarter, we'll put stuff into it and, you know, we're not really talking about it much. Because it's not changing that much in terms of these are very motivated patients. And as they lose the weight, you know, I've been asked qualitatively, and I've even asked sleep physicians, like, give me the reason why why are they more adherent? What do you think it is? And they talk about lifestyle. These people are eating better, feeling better, exercising more, and therefore, sleeping better. They also talk about the low weight main for those on APAP vitals that are automated in terms of titration maybe lowering their pressures. Which can increase adherence as well. And so, you know, lots of hypotheses out in the literature. We're gonna see lots of clinical literature in this space. But the big change, I think, this quarter is you know I mean, if you look at the clinical data, you know, dental device might sort of, you know, seventy percent treat an implant or a drug might half treat sleep apnea. There's only one gold standard that fully treats this sleeping disorder, this sleep suffocation disorder, and that is positive airway pressure. And it's incredibly effective, completely noninvasive. And completely reversible. And so the risk for the patient is nothing. It's not like going under the knife. For an implant or putting something into your body that could have all sorts of side effects. And so yeah, the propensity to start is low, and we're tracking really carefully that adherence rate. And yeah, we're getting good results there. So you know, the real question is how fast will they bring people into the funnel, and can we expand the funnel, the home sleep apnea testing funnel with night owl the sleep lab channel with better products like Deepak GX, more integration into Somniewer, into Brightree, into Myer, into AirView. So we're preparing the infrastructure, if you like, David, for the flow of new patients that'll come from this. Yeah. So the article, all people will lose a bit of weight and stop. It's just not happening. Talk to any patient, do the clinical research, look at the clinical data, If you don't believe our one million patients in our study, go interview a doctor who says, no. Absolutely not. They wouldn't think about it. They were actually doubling down on their use of it because they're feeling better across the board. And half treating suffocation is not treating suffocation, and the patients themselves know that. And certainly, their doctors know that. There's always churn, but the churn's lower in that group. And our job is to drive up adherence programs, resupply programs, which lead to better outcomes. And now from our data leads to thirty-seven percent lower death rates in the patients sticking to therapy. Fifty-five percent lower cardiovascular death rates. This is a big deal. Thanks for the questions, Dave. And I think, Kevin, we're right at time.
Operator: I believe we have time for one more question from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Brett Fishbin: Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in here at the end. Just I'll ask one follow-up on the gross margin trends. You called out manufacturing and logistics efficiencies as a primary driver of the sequential and year-over-year improvement. Just was hoping if you could maybe expand on what some of the key initiatives in those buckets have been like, where you're seeing the most impact. Thank you.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Sure, Brett. On the distribution and freight, we're really seeing a strong improvement in our sea freight to air freight ratio. So that's improved a lot. So we're pretty close to where we were pre-COVID actually. So that's been a strong driver. Which has been there probably for the last twelve, eighteen months, and that continues. So that's a big one there. Manufacturing efficiencies. You know what? It's about doing a bunch of small things really well and driving that and improving your process, improving routing times, for example, So doing a bunch of things, looking at overhead and so on. You also get benefits of scale, obviously, as we continue to grow. And the other thing on that is the AS ten and even the AS eleven platforms are quite mature now. So as they mature, you get just better and better at making those devices and then you can improve along the way. In a sense continuous improvement programs, if you like. So they really drive that and at our scale can have quite a significant impact. So that's hopefully, give you a little bit more color on kind of some of the drivers there.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks to the over ten thousand ResMedians providing these products and services that we talked about to patients in over one hundred and forty countries, worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thank you also to what you do for our patients, our physicians, providers, payers, and health care communities, and how you build value for our stakeholders, especially our shareholders who are listening to us today, which I know many of you ResMedians are shareholders as well. We'll talk to all of our stakeholders here again in around ninety days. Thank you. Over to you, Sally.
Sally Schwartz: Great. Thank you, Mick. And thank you everyone for listening. We appreciate your time and interest. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. Kevin, you may now close the call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2025 Q2  (2025-01-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matt, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Ott, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Mike Ott: Great. Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we'll discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide helpful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Great. Thank you, Mike, and good morning and good afternoon as we welcome our shareholders and review ResMed's second-quarter fiscal year 2025 results. I'm pleased to share that ResMed delivered another strong quarter of global top-line and bottom-line growth. We achieved excellent year-over-year performance in Q2 with solid revenue growth, improved gross margins, combined with disciplined investments in both R&D and SG&A, resulting in very strong operating profit and net profit performance. These results reflect the hard work of 10,000 plus ResMedians and our dedication to improving the lives of patients, improving the workflow of home care providers, physicians, payers, and the communities that we serve in over 140 countries worldwide. The foundation of our continued positive performance lies in our clear market-leading value proposition, including the sustainable competitive advantage that we have established with our best-in-class hardware and software products as well as our digital health ecosystem. Through cloud-connectable medical devices, masks, and accessories as well as digital platforms and ongoing investments in technology, including specifically ML, AI, and generative AI. We are committed to helping hundreds of millions of people so that they can sleep better, breathe better, and live longer and higher-quality lives. Let me start with a high-level review of our financials. I'm proud to report that we delivered global revenue growth of 10%, reflecting positive and consistent contributions across our combined sleep health, breathing health, and residential care software portfolio. Global device sales were driven by strong market performance across our U.S., as well as Europe, Asia, and rest of world markets, reflecting the continuing demand for our AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. Device sales remained strong, growing double-digits year-over-year. We increased the global availability of our AirSense 11 platform this quarter, launching in India during Q2. We will have additional country launches of AirSense 11 planned throughout calendar year 2025. We make the market-leading sleep health platform with the AirSense 11. I want to make it clear that there is still strong global demand for the second-best device platform in the market and that is the AirSense 10 range. Our masks and accessories business also had another strong quarter, delivering double-digit global growth in that category as well. Ongoing rollout of Brightree ReSupply and Snap technology have helped in our U.S. market. And we expect to maintain that momentum as we launch Snap technology that can work on all HME management platforms throughout calendar year 2025. We achieved 230 basis points of margin expansion in non-GAAP gross margin year-over-year to 59.2%, reflecting our ongoing focus on improving operating efficiencies. With disciplined investments in R&D and SG&A, we achieved a 29% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. Our new Head of supply chain, Shane Azzi, and his team are committed to driving increased supply and increased manufacturing efficiencies by investing in technology and infrastructure to power long-term cost improvements. By balancing this cost discipline with strategic investments in new product introductions, we will continue to drive sustainable and profitable growth for ResMed. We have published peer-reviewed studies showing categorically that ReSupply programs drive patient adherence. They improve patient outcomes and they also lower long-term costs for the healthcare system. In the U.S., our digital health ecosystem, including both AirView for players, Brightree for home medical equipment players, as well as for patients, the myAir app, they continue together to power these ReSupply programs. We are actively investing in appropriate modified versions of the successful U.S. ReSupply programs into our global markets. Each of the 140 countries that we operate in have different regulatory, reimbursement, economic as well as cultural norms. It's our opportunity to leverage ResMed's knowledge of each of those markets and to optimize the best way for a person to regularly receive fresh supply for their life-changing and life-saving care. ResMed is an innovation machine. Our ongoing investments of 6% to 7% of revenues into R&D is a key growth driver and a key part of our long-term success. With trailing 12 months revenue around $5 billion, that's $300 million to $350 million that we invest annually into R&D, creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and the most intelligent devices, masks, and software solutions. During the quarter, we launched the AirTouch N30i to select markets. The AirTouch N30i is a world first from ResMed with its unique fabric-based patient interface. My philosophy is this. We sleep on cotton sheets. We have fabric covers for the pillows that we sleep on. Why can't we have sleep apnea therapy that is just as comfortable as that? Early feedback from respiratory therapists, from physicians, and from patients directly is that the comfort and fit of the AirTouch N30i is outstanding. This new technology could permanently change the basis of competition in mask innovation. It's one thing to create a prototype of the mask. It's another thing to have manufacturability at scale with top quality, top comfort, excellent sale, and great long-term patient outcomes. Watch this space for our new-to-world fabric-based AirTouch technology launched first year on the AirTouch N30i platform. During the quarter, we announced another collaboration with the Apple Vision Pro team, with the launch of what we call the Kontor Head Strap. This is a premium accessory for the Apple Vision Pro. ResMed, as all of you as shareholders know, is the world leader in providing facial interfaces in the field of sleep health and breathing health, and healthcare technology at home. This is great to see that now a top consumer tech company like Apple has chosen to partner with ResMed on an interface that we make that delivers a superb balance of softness and support for the extended wear-time that users of the Apple Vision Pro need. The Apple Vision Pro accessory is crafted with a blend of ResMed's exclusive ultra-premium materials and designed to be gentle on the skin. This project shows that ResMed's expertise is applicable outside a pure-play in medical technology and it's part of this convergence of medtech and consumer tech. And the learning that will provide for both the medical and consumer fields is an important part of this opportunity. Watch this space. ResMed had a very strong presence at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas at the start of 2025 just a couple of weeks ago. We provided a digital sleep lounge that offered people a place to go to relax and to learn about the importance of sleep health, of breathing health, and care delivered at home. Across CES display booths, there were many consumer tech companies showing their latest and greatest sleep wellness and sleep monitoring solutions from Apple to Samsung to Google's Fitbit, Oura Ring, Garmin, Whoop, and beyond. We are very excited to have Sleep Health become mainstream. Interestingly, ResMed products were on display in the massive Samsung booth. Samsung was touting their new Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea detection capability and illustrating the link between their Galaxy Watch ecosystem and ResMed's market-leading products for the treatment of sleep apnea. I'll talk more about sleep apnea detectors and this convergence of MedTech and consumer tech a little later. But now let me provide a brief update on GLP-1s, the new class of pharmaceuticals that are focused on weight loss, diabetes and metabolic control, cardiovascular outcomes, and now also sleep apnea. I'll then come back to consumer wearables that can detect sleep apnea. So late during our Q2 on December 20th, Eli Lilly gained FDA approval for the use of Zepbound a GLP-1, in patients with obesity and moderate to severe sleep apnea with a reduced calorie diet and physical exercise. It's interesting to note that the SURMOUNT-OSA trial excluded patients with diabetes. In the lead-up to its launch to consumers, Eli Lilly's early educational documents that are available to the medical community on the Eli Lilly website includes a patient guide for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. It was encouraging to see that Lilly followed the American Academy of Sleep Medicine or AASM guidelines that explicitly state that positive airway pressure devices are the frontline and gold standard for treating sleep apnea. And that these PAP devices, CPAP, APAP, bilevel have the highest efficacy when used as directed. Beyond just the guidelines, their own FAQs on the Lilly website informed physicians and patients that CPAP devices are now smaller and quieter and that CPAP masks have been refined to increase comfort. We agree. We welcome the opportunity to educate potential patients on the benefit of all therapy options for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, starting with the gold standard frontline CPAP, APAP, bilevel, then considering the next most efficacious dental devices. And finally, looking at pharmaceutical or even surgical options. On January 14, 2025, the AASM issued a quick reference guide to providers, considering the use of new drugs for the treatment of OSA. The AASM continues to emphasize the use of positive airway pressure as the frontline treatment and suggests that weight-loss drugs may be useful as an adjunctive or combination therapy. Our experience with bariatric surgery patients these last two-plus decades. And now with these latest generation GLP-1s, these last five-plus years is that when someone loses weight, that doesn't change their age, that doesn't change their gender, that doesn't change most importantly in this context, their craniofacial anatomy. These are key risk factors for sleep apnea. We are looking forward to addressing the educational gap on the prevalence and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuing medical education or CME programs that we are aiming specifically at primary-care physicians. And we're especially targeting those who are high-volume, currently high-volume GLP-1 prescribers. They will be the frontline for the patients that pharmaceutical companies will attract as they ramp up their own consumer advertising throughout calendar year 2025 and beyond. We are now tracking 1.2 million patients who have had a prescription for the latest generation GLP-1 medicines and who also have a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy. The data are clear in this real-world analysis and that is that these people are very motivated. In fact, they are more than 10% more likely to start PAP therapy. That motivation versus a garden variety PAP patient remains. One year later, we continue to see north of 3% higher not just adherence, but actually buying masks and accessories. Then the curves separate with a greater than 5% increased propensity for ReSupply at two years. These data have now been steady with the same trend, plus or minus a couple of tens of basis points as we have grown our analysis from a year ago with 300,000 plus patients to now tracking over 1.2 million patients. One thing is clear, the real-world evidence shows that the combination of a GLP-1 prescription and a PAP prescription is powerful for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. They start our therapy more and adhere more to PAP therapy over the long term. And we know that adhering to PAP therapy over the long term saves healthcare costs, improves patient quality-of-life outcomes, and lowers patient mortality. We believe the GLP-1s are helping activate a whole new population of patients into the healthcare system that weren't coming in before and ResMed is well-positioned to support them. Okay. Next, let's briefly return to the consumer wearables megatrend. The velocity of change in the way the world operates in consumer tech and in health tech is amazing and ResMed is right in the nexus of that. In fact, we are driving adoption of basic ML and AI broadly into our software offerings across the Board. And we are pioneering generative AI with our commercially available product Dawn, which I see is just the start of what I call the sleep health concierge platform. More to come on that later. But the bottom line is consumers are more focused than ever on tracking their personal health, their personal wellness, and their personal well-being. The Samsung Galaxy Watch was the first to get de novo FDA clearance for detecting OSA early in 2024 and Apple announced sleep apnea detection from the main stage as they launched the latest generation Apple Watch in September 2024. The data tracked by those two leading wearables will provide the opportunity for their millions -- no, their hundreds of millions of users to potentially detect sleep apnea. This is not a one-quarter step change, but a chance for gradual and steady long-term demand-generation for sleep apnea patients that benefits ResMed. Of course, the information goes both ways. Patients can get their myAir scores from the ResMed myAir app, but they can also get them from their Apple Watch. They can get their myAir scores on their Samsung Galaxy Watch. We know that this type of gamification of healthcare can help drive adherence. We expect more and more people are going to want access real-time to sleep data as the interest in improving sleep continues to grow. As I said earlier, it's not just these two leading tech players in Apple and Samsung, but it's also Google's Fitbit, Oura's Ring, Whoops device, Garmin devices, and beyond. We expect that they will all continue to expand their sleep architecture and sleep assessment capabilities. And my personal bet is that more than a few of these other wearable players will add sleep apnea detection in 2025. We see this investment by consumer wearables companies and pharmaceutical companies in sleep health as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for sleep apnea awareness. We believe that these technologies will help drive more potential patients to seek out information regarding their sleep health and their breathing health. ResMed's obligation is to help sleep health-concerned consumers to find their own pathway to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for sleep apnea, where ResMed leads the world with the most clinically effective, the least invasive, the most proven, and the most cost-effective solutions on the planet. We don't believe that these two megatrends will drive a simple one-and-done or one-time step-change in patient flow. Rather, we believe that this will be an increase from baseline patient flow that starts over one, three, five quarters as these technologies roll-out, but has durability over one, three, five years, and beyond. We are creating the infrastructure for demand generation, demand capture, and demand conversion to help these people find the care that they need. Watch this space. So turning now to our long-term vision that we outlined at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange last September. Our ResMed 2030 strategy is crystal clear. It's focused on three key pillars. Number one, growing and differentiating our core sleep health and breathing health business. Two, expanding into adjacent areas, including respiratory insufficiencies such as COPD, including insomnia, including COMISA, and beyond. And three, leveraging our leadership in digital health to drive better outcomes for patients, for providers, and for payers. So a key component of pillar number-one is driving the value of the ResMed brand. That decision, that moment of truth when a physician writes a script for ResMed when a respiratory therapist recommends a ResMed mask solution when a healthcare provider chooses a ResMed digital health solution, or where a consumer anywhere in the 140 countries where we sell our products and services establishes a personal relationship with the ResMed brand. All of these moments added together, that is the equity that is built into the ResMed brand. We will continue to build our ResMed brand awareness and evolve our brand to be more future-focused and closer to the customer. I want to make it clear that our marketing tech team will ensure that there is ROI return on investment for every single demand generation, every single demand capture, and every single demand conversion project as we move more and more people into the diagnosis and treatment funnel. With over 1 billion people suffocating with sleep apnea worldwide, we have a lot of runway ahead in our core market. It's great that we have a couple of megatrends on our side to help. The global demand for sleep health and breathing health solutions is growing in our mission to help people sleep better, breathe better, and live high-quality lives to their fullest potential continues to drive everything that we do. But when you combine those opportunities from our core sleep apnea market with pillar number two, that is expanding into new adjacencies. The future couldn't be brighter. We will continue to invest in our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators for respiratory insufficiency, including COPD and neuromuscular disease. We will continue expanding our digital health and medtech solutions for insomnia patients. I believe we're just at the start of that journey of that awful disease that we need to treat the inability to get to sleep, stay asleep, and wake up with refreshing sleep and beyond. And for the generation of people who want to age in place to receive healthcare at the best place, lowest cost, lowest acuity, and highest quality of life, which is their home. We have our market-leading software solutions like Brightree and MEDIFOX, and we are best positioned to lower costs, improve efficiencies and improve long-term outcomes. We create life-changing healthcare technologies that people love. In the last 12 months, we provided over 147 million people with a product such as a CPAP, an APAP, a bilevel, a non-invasive ventilator, a mask, a cushion, a humidifier, other accessories. Or a digital health solution such as myAir, AirView, Somnoware, Brightree, MEDIFOX, and beyond. Our ambitious goal is to empower that impact and to empower 500 million people to reach their full potential in 2030 with sleep health, breathing health, and healthcare technology provided to them right where they live. With our strong financial foundation, our innovative product pipeline, and our expanded digital health ecosystem, we are well-positioned to meet and beat our goals. Thank you to all the 10,000 ResMedians for your hard work and dedication to make our mission possible, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued trust and support of our global ResMed team. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for a deeper dive into our financials, and then we'll open up the floor to questions. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons under the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.28 billion, an increase of 10% on both a headline and constant currency basis. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $2 million during the December quarter. Additionally, we expect that year-over-year movements in foreign currencies will also negatively impact our Q3 revenue somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our residential care software business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, on a constant currency basis, device sales increased by 11%, while mask and other sales also increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 12%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnoses. Masks and other sales also increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia, and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 7% on a constant currency basis. Residential care software revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter, underpinned by strong performance from our MEDIFOX DAN software vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second-quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 230 basis points to 59.2% in the December quarter. Year-over-year, our increase was mainly driven by manufacturing and logistics efficiencies and component cost improvements. Sequential gross margin was consistent with last quarter despite the impact from an unfavorable currency headwind of approximately 30 basis points during the quarter. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives and we are focused on driving further improvement in our gross margin. Looking forward, we expect gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% on both a headline and constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and to a lesser extent increases in marketing and travel expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 18.8% compared to 19.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2025. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 10% on both a headline and constant currency basis. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related expenses. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.3% compared to the 6.4% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 19%, underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our interest expense for the quarter was $1 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect to generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18% compared to 20.7% in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to higher tax benefits associated with employee equity compensation this quarter. We estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 29% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 29%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $309 million, reflecting strong operating results, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $46 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $522 million. On December 31, we had $673 million in gross debt and $151 million in net debt and we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 307,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $75 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares to the value of approximately $75 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions, and continue our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Mike.
Mike Ott: Thanks, Brett. Matt, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dan Hurren from MST. Please go ahead.
Dan Hurren: Good morning. Can you hear me?
Michael Farrell: Yes, loud and clear, Dan.
Dan Hurren: Hello?
Michael Farrell: Yes, loud and clear, Dan.
Operator: Sorry, Dan, we can hear your line if you can hear us.
Dan Hurren: I'm sorry, yes. Sorry. My apologies. Just a question for Brett in regards to currency. At one of the recent speaking events, there were comments made about the negative impact of FX on margins. Now, I think you've just spoken to some negative top line. Can you just talk us through any other FX impacts down the P&L as we've seen the strength of the U.S. dollar?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Hi, Dan. Yes. I mean, you called out particularly sequentially that 30 basis points impact for us. If you look down the P&L, the net impact was negative $0.02 on our EPS for this quarter.
Dan Hurren: I guess, sorry, my question was more looking forward on the spot rates that we have in the moment, in…
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Got it. Got it. Yes. We've -- if we look at it, you think about it, we sort of take our -- if you like revenue kind of straight away in the quarter, but there is typically about a quarter's lag where we see some benefit from a weaker, say, Singapore dollar and Aussie dollar, for example. So that sort of helps us going to Q3 but we still have some of that Euro weakness coming through. So my expectation on gross margin will be relatively neutral on our gross margin and we'll get in a slight benefit, if you like, on a headline basis through R&D and SG&A.
Dan Hurren: That's great. Thank you very much, Brett. Thank you, all.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question is from Davin Thillainathan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Davin Thillainathan: Oh, hi, Mick and team. Thank you for the presentation. Just a question on the devices part of your business. Clearly really strong U.S. devices growth, a double-digit profile. Could you give us some sense there on your thinking about the GLP-1 impact there? I know there were some comments on your opening remarks about the patient flow potentially stepping up from GLP-1s. Do you feel that's starting to sort of flow through in the numbers now or do you feel like it's perhaps a bit back-end weighted considering the Lilly level expansion there as well? Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks. It's a good question. And there is multiple impacts of those two megatrends I talked about, the GLP-1s and the consumer tech companies, and their awareness they're driving in sleep apnea. Both of them drive together to drive patients to think about sleep health and breathing health, and specifically about sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. And so, yes, look, incredibly strong performance as you noted, plus 12% devices year-on-year for the quarter in the U.S., plus 9% in Europe, Asia, rest of world, and just a great growth. I don't think there is a huge material impact from specifically the new Zepbound indication in Eli Lilly, they just got their indication in December. And typically pharmaceutical companies wait six-plus months before they really start their direct-to-consumer advertising. And so what we're seeing now is a lot of clinical education, continuing medical education, CME programs from ResMed and from Lilly and others to primary care physicians and that's what I expect. But that education alone, I think will start to drive some demand gen into the funnel. It's going to be up to ResMed to really partner with those primary-care physicians to ensure demand capture, conversion, and curation into the sleep apnea diagnosis treatment and management funnel. And so that sort of pathway, if you like, is in its early phases. I think we're in the very early stages of that. As I said in the prep remarks, I think the impact will start to happen over the coming one, three, five quarters where we'll start to get those models working, but it will have a durable impact over the coming sort of one, three, five years and beyond. So this isn't sort of, as I said earlier, it's not a one-and-done, it's not a single-step change, it's a gradual improvement in that patient flow. So I think we're in the very early innings of the flow of extra patients from GLP-1s and from consumer tech. Thanks for the questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Lyanne Harrison: Yes. Good morning all, and congratulations on very strong devices growth, both in the United States and the rest of the world. Can you point out if there is any, I guess, bulk purchases or one-offs that might have occurred this quarter or also if there was any DME stocking ahead of potential tariffs?
Michael Farrell: Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. The short answer is no. We haven't had any of that sort of one-time stocking. We did talk last quarter in Q1 about Japan where we launched the AirSense 11. And so Q1, there was some stocking in Japan because that is a sort of fleet management business of our main distributors there. But no, in Q2, none of that. We do not believe the ResMed will have any impact to us on any tariffs when you hear -- and I sit on the Board of AdvaMed, so I'm carefully involved with Washington, D.C. and Brussels, and Beijing from that group. But we have a Trump-ready group and we were looking at the tariffs. And as we see them, even if there are blanket tariffs on China, there'll be no impact on ResMed, we manufacture in Sydney, Singapore, Atlanta, and beyond. And so none of those will be included. It may impact one of our competitors from China as they import to the U.S. through Florida. So if there was a blanket impact on China, it could have a negative impact on them. And if there was a blanket sort of USCA -- USMCA, so Mexico-Canada change from the Trump administration, which could happen and has been threatened. That could impact a competitor from New Zealand who does a lot of mass manufacturing in the Maquiladoras there on the border -- on the Mexican side of the border. So both of those could have a negative impact on our competitors. We're not banking on it. And in fact, at AdvaMed I will advocate for a carve-out for medtech and/or food industries. I think they should be carved out even though it would hurt our competitors. I think I'd take the high road and say what's right for the community there. But let's see, we get to see what happens over the coming weeks and months there. But at ResMed, we're really focused for any of these outcomes and we saw a pretty steady flow of patients into the funnel, and that resulted in the strong device growth. Our challenge, as I said earlier in the prep remarks, Lyanne, is to ensure that we sort of continue that momentum and do our best to capture these patients who are being identified from their wearables or coming into the healthcare system because of the awareness of the new pharmaceutical class that can partially treat or can treat in combination therapy with CPAP. And so we'll be watching that and putting into place a lot of programs to see what we can do to maintain the great momentum that we've had. Thanks for the question.
Lyanne Harrison: Great. Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Next question is from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Please go ahead.
Laura Sutcliffe: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Could you talk to your ability to scale things like home sleep testing and remote setup and anything else you think can help with getting all these potential new patients who might be coming your way onto therapy as soon as possible? Because one thing we hear is that sleep physicians in the U.S. are struggling maybe to see all of the patients that they possibly could be. So just wondering how you can help create some space to get that done. Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Laura, it's actually -- it's a great question. And as you noted in your question, there is a limit to sort of the physical space that you can have in the infrastructure required for in lab -- sleep labs. And many of them are at capacity. As you've seen, just the awareness of sleep health and breathing health, people are thinking a bit about it and asking questions and going to see the primary care physicians getting referrals. We want to make sure that sleep lab capacity remains at full usage but is focused on the more sick and more severe patients. So, patients who might have central sleep apnea, they need to be in a sleep lab because then they can diagnose their inability to breathe, which is with an open airway, which is central sleep apnea, and get them a prescription for something like adaptive servo-ventilation, one of our high-end therapies that can help ventilate the patient with an open airway. Also with Overlap Syndrome, if patients have COPD, they need to be in one of those labs because they're probably going to put them on a bilevel or non-invasive ventilation therapy to ventilate the patient and account for the obstruction if they have Overlap Syndrome. And if they have concomitant insomnia, as I talked about in the prep remarks that is now called COMISA, the physician may use CPAP or APAP or bilevel for their obstructive sleep apnea. And right now, most of the options are only pharmaceutical options for the insomnia part but watch this space for the future there. To your point, in your question, you said scaling the home sleep testing part, that's the part that can flex and that's the part that can flex quickly with this new demand. And even large teaching hospitals like right here in California down the street, there is a large teaching hospital that has very large in-lab setup, but they also have an infrastructure of home sleep apnea testing equipment and that they've got the ability to scale the number of tests that can happen. For those who are at high risk for general garden variety obstructive sleep apnea, those patients should be primarily a funnel to home sleep apnea testing. And so as we get this new flow of patients, ResMed's challenge is to do this demand capture, curation, and conversion and to partner with the sleep labs and the home sleep apnea testing companies. And many of them are one and the same so that they can flex to keep this new demand and to make sure a patient doesn't wait months for a test, but waits days and no longer than weeks. And so we saw during COVID a great flex around home sleep apnea testing when labs were just closed and hospitals weren't allowing patients for outpatient. And so we know that it can work. We've created the infrastructure with ApneaLink Air. We've launched our product called the NightOwl, which is a very small sort of fingertip-sized home sleep apnea testing product and we have partners out there using that. We're open to all of the other diagnostics from Knox Medical. We partner with them in Europe. And so our goal will be to make sure that every time patients come into primary care physicians and get that prescription and that desire for a home sleep apnea test that a sleep physician is available to serve, whether it's in-lab for the more complicated patients and for home sleep apnea testing for the triage of the vast majority of patients that have obstructive sleep apnea alone. So we're ready. We're partnering with the channel. And as I said, over the coming one, three, five quarters, we'll roll out the infrastructure, the one, three, five years, we'll start to see the benefit of the scaling of the patients through there. It's a great question about the infrastructure. Thank you, Laura.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Please go ahead.
Craig Wong-Pan: Great. Thank you. SaaS revenue growth slowed a bit from the first quarter. Could you share what the growth rates were for the different businesses within SaaS? And are you still expecting double-digit growth for that business?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. And yes, our residential care software business includes, MEDIFOX, Brightree, and MatrixCare brands, and beyond, you know, Sidus Medical and others. We don't break out annually or even on a quarterly basis our -- the breakdown of what flow there. I can give you some trends though. Look, as Brett said in his prepared remarks, our MEDIFOX team are doing very well. Our German home nursing and nursing home software business is growing very strongly. So it's ahead of that group growth of 8%. And Brightree is doing very well sort of in line in that high-single-digits. And some of the sort of skilled nursing facilities and senior living facilities post-COVID have never really picked up the rate of growth that they'd had before. And so we're looking -- as we look at those businesses, we look at that as a portfolio management approach and we're investing more and more in the growth parts of the business. Obviously, huge synergies back to our core business in Brightree ReSupply, Snap technology. And so we're investing a lot in Brightree and Snap. And as I said in my prep remarks, scaling Snap for all, which will increase our software as a service residential care software -- core growth, but also will help us maintain momentum in our mask growth in the core market as well. And so we're seeing good growth there. And in some of the lower-growth areas, we'll probably invest less in those areas. And so that sort of portfolio management, I think we guided to high-single-digit growth for our residential care software business. I have guided to double-digit growth in net operating profit and we are achieving that within our residential care software business. And so that's where we're really looking at. Meeting or beating that market growth of high-single-digits and then making sure that we get leverage through SG&A and R&D to strong net operating profit growth in the double-digits there. But it's a good question and it's something we look at very carefully in portfolio management across residential care software. I'm working very closely with the residential care software teams, the leaders of the Brightree, leaders of MEDIFOX, and leaders of our MatrixCare brands to make sure that we're investing in the right areas. And where there is the most potential to lower costs, improved outcomes, and the most synergies with our core ResMed business. Thanks for the question, Craig.
Operator: Next question is from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, want to ask one on the device growth. I mean, it was double-digits. Do you think that's representative of the growth in patients? Or are you getting some kind of pricing benefit up there on top of that? And then -- or is there something maybe happening with rePAP where that's starting to pick up?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question and it's a good one. Look, what we say is that the market growth rate is mid-single-digit for devices globally and mid-single-digit devices growth in the U.S., just standard market growth and high single-digit growth for the masks. And our job, you follow us for a long time, Mike, is to not just accept market growth, but to meet or beat it through demand-generation through, as you said, ReSupply on the mask side, rePAP on the device side. I can tell you our customers and our partners in the channel as well as globally our distributors and some of our consumer businesses in Europe and Asia are really focused on those new patients, but also on patients who have devices that are five or more years old. The warranties are usually only around three years. And so any time after three years, some people want once it's out of warranty to buy. But most insurance companies, including Medicare here in the U.S. will provide a new device after five years, most of the private payers as well. And so I think that rePAP opportunity is still out there and it's something that we've got an opportunity to drive. But look, it's an ongoing battle. It's an ongoing game to make sure that we can get the demand generation, demand curation, the demand capture. And really that demand conversion to make sure a person gets from that referral to the sleep specialist if they have a positive diagnosis for a rapid path to setup. And we've been working a long time on that digital health platform. COVID helped us, it proved that we could do some of these more digitally, more remotely and we've partnered with our physicians to do that. And we've had some success as you saw with really good growth in this quarter. But look, as we look at it, you know the default is mid-single-digit growth in devices, high-single-digit growth in masks, and high single-digit growth in software. Our goal is to meet or beat that every quarter. And we did meet or beat that in every part. We had a beat in the devices, but it's not a given and we don't take it for granted and we know that we have to work hard on all of the above. Demand gen capture curation, rePAP conversion, and ReSupply on the mask side to keep that momentum. Thanks for the question, Mike.
Mike Matson: Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks, Mick. And I'll just revisit back to GLP-1, but actually pivot to a reimbursement coverage. So Lilly secured Medicare coverage for Zepbound, we haven't seen commercial payers come in. So maybe just your views, Mick, how reimbursement in the United States will settle out now that we'll have GLP-1 covered side-by-side with CPAP. Do you think eventually as commercial payers come in, that you'll have to actually step through CPAP to get to a GLP-1? Thanks again.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And look, you and the other great sell-side analysts here know the pharmaceutical side better than I do. I'm a global expert on medtech and particularly respiratory medtech. You're better on your own research and your team to know what's going to happen with -- if Lilly got Zepbound with CMS, what were their chances with United, Humana, Cigna, and beyond. But look, in general, in our space, the private players do follow Medicare at least to some extent, but not a given -- this is a new class of medicines that's not just focused on sleep apnea, it's really focused on that sort of broad obesity play, cardiovascular, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea is probably the third-tier there. So we're not unrealistic to know that this indication for use is not the only thing that Lilly is focused on and it's probably not their number-one priority. But I think having spent tens of millions on the SURMOUNT-OSA trial and having positive data that sort of shows that on average half treatment, 50% treatment of AHI, they've got a good incentive to start advertising. We're going to watch very carefully as they get that reimbursement for Zepbound for different indications. Is it for obesity or is it for our apnea and is it for diabetes? But as they start to get those, I'm pretty certain that we will start to see that sort of direct-to-consumer advertising. What we have seen already is that they are investing in continuing medical education. Their CME programs are out there, they posted on their website a lot of information. And the heartening part for us, Anthony, is that they're following the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. They're following the gold standard guidelines and that really does, as you say, it says frontline, you have to use the most efficacious, least invasive, most proven therapy first. And so you have to use CPAP, APAP, bilevel. And then as their own data showed like Lilly's data in SURMOUNT-OSA showed in there, they had two trials, one non-CPAP patients and one CPAP patients. The CPAP patient trial, those patients did better. They had better outcomes. And so it's not just in the medical science from the American Academy of the Sleep Medicine, it's from Lilly's own clinical data that shows the combination therapy is better. So I think that we'll start to see them do that advertising at some point following their indication for use approval. I don't know if it's six months or 12 months, every pharmaceutical company makes a different decision on every drug. But I look forward to them getting approval, getting coverage as broadly as they can, and starting to advertise and doing the right thing, saying if we want to treat the whole person, you want to treat the core sleep apnea and you want to treat the weight. And that combination therapy, we think is the future of obstructive sleep apnea treatment. We saw it in their data, we see it in our data, the 1.2 million patients we're following. The combination prescription of a GLP-1 prescription and a PAT prescription leads to pretty good outcomes, high start rates, and high propensity to adhere to therapy. And for us, we see that in the purchase of masks and accessories and we know that leads to lower costs and better outcomes, and lower mortality for the patients. So yes, Anthony, early days, as I said, but we're quite excited about that. I haven't got any questions yet about it, but I'm actually slightly more excited about the consumer tech trend because that's already out there. You've got tens of millions of people, hundreds of millions of people with these watches, these wearables, and that -- those algorithms are FDA clear and they can detect sleep apnea and we will start to see those patients come through and it's our challenge to help those people find a digital pathway into the healthcare system. Thanks for the question, Anthony.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Please go ahead.
Mathieu Chevrier: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. Good morning. Just to jump back on that previous question, do you think there is more research to do on the benefits of CPAP and perhaps more education? Because clearly, the pharma company has been quite aggressive at just broadening the potential indications for GLP-1s. Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Look, no, it's a great question. And if you look at the nearly 21 billion nights of respiratory medical data that ResMed has in the cloud, the more than 30 million patients that are part of the AirView ecosystem. The 9.3 million patients that have downloaded the myAir app, we've got a treasure trove of information and we have absolutely -- it's all de-identified, it's private, it's cyber secure and we really focus on really looking, as you said, on that research. We have peer-reviewed published data showing a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are CPAP adherent versus not in our ALASKA study. We have a lot of data that we've shown in improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, reductions in blood pressure, improvements in HbA1c for metabolic control, and beyond. But to your point, I think, given the awareness that's going to be driven by the pharmaceutical companies coming in here, we have to drive more and more of that. So I've challenged our Chief Medical Officer, Carlos Nunez, and his team to increase the velocity and the qualities, velocity is speed plus direction. So not just the speed of clinical research to market from our real-world data, but the direction that it is more focused on outcomes, really showing and we peer-reviewed published this, that is a dose-response relationship between the use of CPAP every night and the lowering of healthcare, all-cause healthcare cost outcomes. So for every hour of sleep using your CPAP, you have a 7% reduction in total healthcare costs for that patient, all the way up to seven hours of sleep, so up to 50% reduction in all-cause costs. And so the more and more ResMed can not only get those data but get those data and put them into the Intermountain Healthcare system, put them into the Kaiser Healthcare system, these great payer providers, Kaiser and beyond. And actually, the mortality data was done with the French government on a social security database, the ALASKA study. The more we can do that in Western, Northern Europe where you've got government-run insurance programs that really do focus on long-term outcomes because the government is the payer for the life of these citizens. And so we're going to have more and more data, watch this space. We are the market leader in digital health and I would say, publication of real-world data and real-world evidence in the field of MedTech and you're going to see more and more from us. And it will only be increased in the momentum with big pharma starting to invest with things like SURMOUNT-OSA showing combination therapy is better than single therapy as well. So more grist for the mill. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question is from David Low from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, I was wondering if we could come back to the question that was asked earlier about the market growth versus ResMed's growth. I mean, clearly with ResMed's dominance in devices, your ResMed largely is the market. So can you even talk a little bit as to what you think the drivers might have been this quarter that we drove the growth rate above 10% versus your estimates of market? I mean, clearly, some of the variables would like to understand the price and mix and whether that really was a contributor. And do you have a sense as to whether rePAP is starting to become a meaningful contributor at this stage, please?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. And as you know, you followed us for a long time too, that there is lots of aspects that go into just the quarterly snapshot. Like clearly, we have a very strong position, we have very strong competition, we have very strong position in the U.S., in Europe, and in Asia. But we do have competition and so we are able to take share. And we are able to disproportionately partner with our physicians, home care providers, and distributors, and beyond where they are able to do better at growing share. So we partner and provide technologies like Brightree and AirView that helps identify patients for ReSupply. And that helped us get -- haven't really talked about it much, but our U.S. mask growth was 12% in the quarter, which was really strong too. And so those Brightree ReSupply and Snap technologies are really strong. But on the device side, look, yes, a couple of 100 basis points ahead of market, how much of that was -- some of that demand gen work, how much of that was high deductible health plans and what we can do with patients there in the December quarter, how much was rePAP. We have the splits around those. We know the levers that we can turn and we're going to -- what our job is to really, I think in these megatrends is to work out how do we sustainably, incredibly. To an earlier question about infrastructure, make sure that the new patients coming in aren't held in a do-loop, in terms of the time from referral to a sleep specialist to getting that diagnostic and then getting to therapy. And that sort of process optimization, I think is a way that we can maintain that type of momentum. But there are many other aspects, and we -- yes, I mean, I said this earlier, but I think we're in the very, very early stages of seeing any flow from these other big megatrends, but we have to be ready to capture those patients as well. So it's kind of a complex sort of portfolio management approach to demand gen capture and conversion, whether it's existing installed base with ReSupply and rePAP and new patients. And that balance for both devices and masks, I think we're getting down to a pretty good science on it. We did very well this quarter and we'll keep on focusing for 2025 on the long-term investments we're going to need to make in infrastructure and capabilities to capture, convert, and ensure a really good experience for the person as they go from sleep-concerned consumer to a happy patient on therapy for life.
Operator: Next question is from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brett Fishbin: Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a question for Brett, on the gross margin guidance for 2H. Are you still expecting a sequential increase given relatively flat performance in 2Q versus 1Q? Or should we be thinking about 1H as more of a reasonable level for 2H? And just as a follow-up there, what would be the biggest swing factors that you think could drive progress closer to the high-end of the commentary, which would be closer to 60%? Thank you very much.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Brett. Yes, the -- that we sort of guide about 59% to 60%, we're at sort of the low-end there. We certainly got initiatives in place, we want to continue to improve the gross margin. So certainly that's our aim as we work through the second half of FY25. But we think it will be in that range of 59% to 60%. There is a lot of optimization initiatives we're working on. Three key areas is manufacturing, there's procurement initiatives, just scale benefits as well. The progressive transition to the AS11 platform is well played out. Some of the swing factors on there will be things like product mix as well and kind of how favorable or unfavorable that is. Freight, which has stabilized, you know, do we see some benefits in the second half that's probably still a watch and wait. And as we roll out new products as well, that tends to help. So there is a bunch of factors that play out on, that can impact the timing of when these benefits come through. But our priority is to have a good healthy pipeline and then we can deliver that pretty consistently and that should support our gross margin on kind of like a medium-term view, if you like, rather than quarter-by-quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
Michael Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, Matt, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us on this call, and thank you especially to the 10,000 ResMedians operating in 140 countries. Many of you are also shareholders. Thanks for what you do today and every day. You're working with patients, physicians, payers, providers, and healthcare communities to change the world and you build value for stakeholders, especially the shareholders who are listening to us today. So thank you for what you did these last 90 days. We'll talk to you all again in about 90 days. And that concludes the call. I'll hand over to Mike Ott to close us out.
End of Q&A:
Mike Ott: Great. Thank you, Mick, and thank you everyone for listening. We appreciate your time and interest. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed's second quarter 2025 conference call. Matt, you may now close the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-10-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. As Kevin said, we are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide helpful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the reported GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to ResMed's Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and welcome to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review ResMed's first quarter results for fiscal year 2025. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of growth across all of our business segments. We've seen solid revenue growth, improved gross margins, and disciplined investments in both SG&A and R&D, resulting in very strong profit performance. The results we are presenting today reflect the hard work of the 10,000-plus ResMedians operating in over 140 countries worldwide. And the dedication they bring to improving the lives of patients, physicians, providers, and all of our customers every day. Before delving into the details of our financial and strategic initiatives, I want to emphasize that the results we are presenting here today are not just financial in nature. They represent an improvement in health outcomes for many tens of millions of people worldwide. Our mission here at ResMed is to create life-changing healthcare technologies that people love, through cloud-connectable medical devices, masks and accessories, digital health platforms, as well as ongoing investments in the latest technology, including ML and AI and GenAI. We are committed to helping hundreds of millions of people so that they can breathe better, sleep better, and live longer and higher-quality lives. Living the lives that they can to their fullest potential. Now turning to a high-level review of the financials. I'm proud to report that we delivered another strong quarter. Revenue grew by 11%, reflecting strong demand for sleep health and breathing health medical devices, our masks and accessories, as well as our residential care software offerings. We achieved double-digit revenue growth across all product and geographic categories this quarter. Masks and accessories growth was augmented by new patient activations as well as ongoing ReSupply. Our global device sales were driven by strong market performance from both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms. Our focus on operating excellence programs helped us drive operating leverage during the quarter. We achieved 27% growth in our operating profit and we further achieved 34% growth in earnings per share. We're committed to driving increased efficiencies, managing our operating expenses prudently, and investing in areas that power long-term sustainable growth. By balancing strategic investments with cost discipline, we have -- together we're driving an ongoing and sustainable profitable growth here at ResMed. Device sales remain strong, growing by a double-digit percentage year-over-year and we continue to maintain market leadership with our two AirSense platforms. We're supporting the global market and every patient or provider who needs a device has access to our market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We are increasing the availability of our AirSense 11 platform worldwide with regulatory approvals expanding country-by-country. We will see ongoing momentum. Our masks and accessories business had another strong quarter, delivering 11% year-over-year growth. The AirFit F40, ResMed's smallest oronasal mask ever, continues to perform well in the U.S. market and we're expanding the F40's availability across additional global markets. The F40 has a proprietary adaptive feel technology, combined with its lightweight and compact design, it has been incredibly well-received. The F40 is praised for its fit, its comfort, and its adaptability, especially for patients who move frequently during sleep. At our Investor Day on September 30th, we announced the upcoming launch of our latest mask innovation, the AirTouch N30i. Today, I can announce that this amazing new technology will be launched into select markets next week. The AirTouch N30i is ResMed's first mask with a fabric-wrapped frame and a fabric-based patient interface with a soft breathable fabric system for optimal comfort. The way I see it, we sleep with fabric-covered pillows and fabric sheets like cotton. Why can't we have CPAP mask technology that feels just as good? We believe this mask technology will set a new standard for CPAP, APAP, and bilevel patient interface therapy and will help more people love their therapy, including how they feel in the morning and all day, all because they can achieve longer and higher-quality sleep. This technology has been years in the making and we are very proud to be able to deliver it to customers starting next week. ReSupply programs remain a critical element of our strategy to drive adherence, to improve patient outcomes, and to enhance long-term clinical results. Our digital health ecosystem empowers ReSupply through three market-leading platforms, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and providers, as well as Brightree for home medical equipment or HME providers. Published research shows that patients enrolled in ReSupply programs have higher therapy adherence rates in the first year and over the long term. As we expand these types of ReSupply programs globally, we expect to see continued positive impacts on patient outcomes as well as reduced overall healthcare system costs. We're proud of the progress we've made and we're excited about the opportunities in front of us. Let's now talk about two significant macro trends that we've reviewed over recent quarters, namely consumer wearables and a new class of pharmaceutical medicines called GLP-1s. We believe that both of these macro trends will have a significant impact on our business as tailwinds. Let me start with a discussion of GLP-1 medications, with a focus on the latest generation of these medicines that are targeted specifically to treat diabetes and now obesity and beyond. We've designed a real-world data analysis with now n equals 989,000 subjects, who received both a prescription for a GLP-1 medication and a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy. The results from this analysis are clear. People prescribed a GLP-1 and PAP therapy have 10.8 absolute percentage points more likelihood or propensity to commence positive airway pressure therapy, 10.8 absolute percentage points higher. Moreover, once on therapy, people with a GLP-1 prescription and a PAP prescription appear to be even more committed to long-term therapy adherence. Our analysis shows that after 12 months, the ReSupply rate for patients with GLP-1s and PAP prescriptions is 3.2 absolute percentage points higher. At 24 months, this expands even further and the ReSupply rate difference increases to 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for patients on both a GLP-1 and a PAP prescription. This suggests that patients who start GLP-1 therapy are also motivated to start and adhere to their sleep apnea treatment. As these therapies continue to expand in use, we believe that it will be a clear tailwind for our business. Next, let's turn to the consumer wearables macro trend. In July, Samsung began selling its latest generation Galaxy Watch, which now includes detection of moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. Samsung achieved de novo FDA clearance for this capability. Just last month, Apple introduced its latest generation Apple Watches with its own version of possible sleep apnea detection using actigraphy technology tracked over multiple weeks as its detection method. It's incredible to have two world-leading consumer technology companies recognize the importance of tracking sleep health and identifying sleep apnea. In addition to these technologies from Apple and Samsung, other wearables like Google's Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Whoop, and beyond are focusing on sleep health tracking. We see this investment by consumer wearable companies as an incredible once-in-a-generation opportunity for sleep health and breathing health awareness, and particularly for sleep apnea awareness. We believe that these technologies will help drive more patients to seek out information regarding their sleep health and breathing health. ResMed's obligation is to help these sleep health and breathing health consumers find their own pathway to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for sleep apnea, where ResMed leads the world with the most clinically effective, the most non-invasive, the most proven, and the most cost-effective solutions for care. Our strong competitive position here at ResMed is underpinned by continuous innovation, our commitment to patient care, and our digital health ecosystem. We've made significant investments in our product offerings, including the expansion of the availability of cloud-connectable devices, the integration of artificial intelligence into our latest and greatest digital offerings, and the scaling of our digital health tools, such as our patient management system called AirView and our consumer engagement application called myAir, which now has over 8.8 million users globally. Additionally, we recently announced the ability to integrate our own wearable home sleep apnea test system that's called NightOwl with our myAir platform. This will enable a more streamlined diagnosis process and provide improved consumer engagement on their path to therapy. Let's now turn to our long-term vision for growth, what we call our ResMed 2030 strategy. As we outlined during our recent Investor Day just over three weeks ago at the New York Stock Exchange, this strategy is centered on three key pillars: one, growing and differentiating our core sleep health and breathing health business; two, expanding into near and adjacent areas; and three, leveraging our leadership in digital health to drive better outcomes for patients, physicians, providers, and payers. Let me cover some high-level thoughts on each of these three pillars, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett, and after that, we'll go into our Q&A session. So one, sleep health and breathing health. Here at ResMed, we are laser-focused on maintaining and expanding our global leadership in sleep health and breathing health. Our goal is to bring the best products to market, products that are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and the most intelligent. The term CPAP has traditionally stood for continuous positive airway pressure. Taking some artistic license, I would propose that it now stands for computerized positive airway pressure. And the smarts go beyond the devices themselves. By liberating the data to the cloud, here at ResMed, we can engage with patients, with physicians, providers, and whole healthcare systems like never before. We now have approximately 20 billion nights of sleep health and breathing health data in the cloud, and we have more than 27 million 100% cloud-connectable devices that we have provided in over 140 countries worldwide. This allows us to partner with patients, physicians, providers, and beyond with unparalleled insights, ultimately leading to better product and better software offerings that help patients and their caregivers achieve better health outcomes, lower costs for the overall healthcare system, and better management of chronic diseases. Second, health technology at home. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions for care delivered right where people live and often that's right in their own home. We are introducing the basic power of machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as more advanced generative AI to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Through platforms like myAir and AirView, as well as our broad residential care software offerings, including go-to-market product brands like Brightree, MatrixCare, or MEDIFOX DAN, we are making healthcare more accessible, more efficient, and more patient-centered. We're also developing AI-driven solutions to further personalize healthcare and improve therapy adherence. Let me briefly update on two in-market products in this AI-driven space. Our compliance coach digital offering is helping home medical equipment providers identify the most at-risk patients for adherence issues and is making a significant impact to help deliver timely interventions to improve therapy outcomes for patients as well as their physicians and their providers. Our latest generative AI-driven consumer product that we call Dawn, is helping more people get access to the information they need. And to answer questions they have about their own personal sleep health, breathing health, and beyond. After just a few months of Dawn being launched into our U.S. market, we've seen 25% of visitors initiate a session with Dawn. This has led to an extraordinary 40% reduction in the volume of direct-to-live human contact center queries, allowing tech to do what tech does best and our people to connect with customers how they connect best as humans. The bottom line is these technologies represent higher quality, better outcomes, and lower costs for the healthcare system and we are just getting started. Three, expanding into adjacencies. We are investing in adjacent areas, including insomnia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, and other respiratory insufficiency fields, including neuromuscular disease and beyond. With an aging population and an increasing incidence of chronic diseases, these areas represent significant growth opportunities. We continue to expand our cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia or CBTi offerings with a product called Somnoware, while also looking at other novel technologies in the market for the 860 million people worldwide who suffer from insomnia, the inability to get to sleep and stay asleep. We're also building on our leadership in non-invasive ventilation for COPD patients to help develop new pathways for high-flow therapy in the home. The 480 million people who suffer from COPD urgently need better therapy and we are working on it. We also believe there is a significant opportunity for ResMed to capitalize on the growing trend of people worldwide seeking better sleep health regardless of whether they have clinically significant sleep apnea. And we're excited to explore what this means for ResMed as we build on our leadership in sleep apnea to extend more broadly into global sleep health, breathing health, and in fact, all health technology that's delivered in the home. As we look ahead, we are more energized than ever by the opportunities in front of us. The global demand for sleep health and breathing health solutions is growing. And our mission to help people sleep better, breathe better, and live higher-quality lives to their fullest potential continues to drive everything we do. We have updated our goal aligned with our 2030 strategy, and we now plan to empower over 500 million people to reach their fullest potential in 2030 with sleep health, breathing health, and health tech at home. With our strong financial foundation, our innovative product pipeline, and our expanding digital health ecosystem, we are best positioned to achieve that goal. ResMed is at the forefront of a rapidly evolving healthcare technology landscape. We're leading with improving patient outcomes, applying new technology, and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thank you to the 10,000-plus ResMedians whose hard work and dedication make our mission possible and thank you to you, our shareholders for your continued trust and support. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for a deeper dive into our financials and then we'll open the floor up for questions. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had a strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11% on both a headline and constant currency basis. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $4 million during the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Residential Care Software business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 11%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions increased by 10%. Globally, device sales increased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 11%, supported by solid ongoing new patient demand. Masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia, and other regions, device sales increased by 9% on a constant-currency basis, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Residential Care Software revenue increased by 12% in the September quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME software vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 320 basis points to 59.2% in the September quarter. The increase was primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and component cost improvements and an increase in average selling prices. Sequentially, gross margin was broadly consistent with last quarter. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased air and sea freight costs will continue to impact our gross margin throughout fiscal year 2025. However, we have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last 12 months and we are focused on driving initiatives to further improve our gross margin. Looking forward, we continue to expect gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 7%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to 20.2% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.5% compared to 6.9% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 27%, underpinned by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $1.7 million. Given our low debt levels, we expect net interest expense to be less than $1 million in the second quarter. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.2%. We estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 35% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 34%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $326 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $426 million. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $30 million. We have now repaid our variable debt and our term debt remains at attractive interest rates relative to the current market. On September 30, we had $677 million in gross debt and $251 million in net debt, and we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. During the quarter, we purchased 222,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to purchase shares to the value of approximately $75 million per quarter through the remainder of fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions, and continue our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to you to provide the instructions again and run the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live.
Laura Sutcliffe: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Do you have any sense of pre-orders for your new mask? I know it's not available yet, but any sense of what demand looks like for that product?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Laura. You know it's de-minimis at this point in terms of not material to the global financials. And so we don't release information like that. But what I can tell you is that we have shown this technology to our commercial teams in our big markets where it's going to launch next week. And there's incredible excitement. The marketing team have put together some fantastic programs. The sales team are ready to take it to customers. But most important here is the product engineering teams and the product management teams. This has been over a decade in development, it's really hard to take fabric and custom apply it onto Liquid Silicon Rubber and do that at scale. The scale that ResMed needs to launch a mask like this to the global market. So I'm really excited about this technology. As a personal user of these types of devices, the idea of moving from a rubber type or a plastic type product to fabric is incredible. I truly think this is a game changer, but very early days, and nothing material to report at this point other than the great technology and the excitement of the commercial team. Thanks for the question, Laura.
Laura Sutcliffe: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live. Craig, your line...
Michael Farrell: Craig, if you are there you might be on mute.
Craig Wong-Pan: Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the rest of world devices growth. 9% growth is good growth there. I was wondering if there was much benefit coming through from AirSense 11 sales given that they are higher priced. Or if not, could you just explain some of the kind of growth drivers there for rest of world devices?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Look, Craig, as you know, that's Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world. So there's quite a lot that goes into that 9% number, certainly very strong. We think we're holding share or taking share in the sort of 140 countries that are included in that broad group of countries. What I can tell you is, it's full competition. All players are in those markets and we're loving that global competition and we're loving having the smallest, quietest, and the most comfortable devices. As you alluded to in your question, there is obviously some combination of the switch from AirSense 10 to AirSense 11 in the countries where that's improved and that has a higher price and a lower COGS point. And so there are some advantages to that. And in the revenue line, you'll see some of that. But I can tell you the vast majority of that -- the vast, vast, vast majority of that is volume and just the growth that we're able to achieve and that we're driving through demand, gen demand capture, and demand conversion in global markets. And I'm really just proud of Andrew Huxter and the team in Europe and Tony Lou in the team in Asia-Pac, they're just up there and performing really well and excited to -- 12 months in their new role is just really excelling. So great to see that. Thanks for the question, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, it's Jimmy on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter here. Mick, I wanted to maybe touch on devices here, and it's great to see double-digit growth worldwide. As you've digested the drivers of the strength this quarter and maybe determine what you attribute the strength to. Are you seeing any pull-through from Samsung or the spotlight that GLPs are putting on OSA? And maybe just talk to some of the confidence that might be giving you as you look at how ResMed is trying to make an impact in growing the market longer term?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. It allows us to talk to those macro trends and also sort of the micro, what happened these last 90 days. Firstly on the micro, look, U.S., Canada, Latin America device growth was exceptional at 11%. Just want to be clear, that's on a comp of 2% from this time a year ago. So in Q1 2024, we had 2% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. So very good growth at 11%, but it's on a relatively low comp. So won't take over credit for that. But what I will say is that we're definitely holding share and taking share in those markets and it's great to have the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So we can have the number one rated device in the world, which is the AirSense 11, and the number two rated device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 available for sale there. So I think that has a combination of it. To the specific part of your question around Samsung with their de novo clearance earlier in the year and then Apple with their most recent launch of their latest watch with S, possible sleep apnea detection, and Samsung with de novo FDA clearance for moderate-to-severe sleep apnea detection. I think it's very early days in those new technologies. They've just been rolled out. I think there's a long runway to go as they get them out there. In a long runway, if you think about the analog being Apple Watch launching an EKG capability, what, 5, 5.5 years ago, and it's really now just starting to get good flow-through cardiology. I think it will go faster than that, but it won't be sort of in this one or two quarters since Samsung and just a quarter or less since Apple launched theirs and so really early days there. Look, I do think the GLP-1 trend of getting patients into primary care is helping and we're tracking 989,000 patients now with combo prescriptions for GLP-1s and those PAP and those are having some tailwind effects. So all of these macro trends are positive. What I can tell you is, I think it's just getting awareness out there. All this talks to the importance of sleep health, breathing health, and that people are thinking about it. Big consumer tech companies, big pharmas are thinking about it and people in general are and they're coming into the healthcare system and they're getting those prescriptions. So really excited about 11% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America on a 2% comp, really excited about Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth of 9% and global growth of 10% constant currency in our devices category. And look, I'll give credit to the team. I think the team has done a great job commercially and a great job with our partners in home care providers, physicians getting prescriptions, and helping to expand the diagnostic funnel. Again, early days, we're excited about the flow and really, really proud to report these numbers.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, perhaps a similar topic. Mask sales for the last year or so have been double-digit. I'm looking particularly the North American market. Just wondering if you could talk about the drivers there. I mean, what comes to mind is master patient is increasing, adherence is increasing and perhaps ResMed's market share is increasing. Can I get a touch on what you think the drivers are and maybe talk a little bit about what to expect in the future, please?
Michael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a good question. You helped me answer it with three of the areas where that growth is coming from. Yes, I mean, look, masks and accessories growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America was at 10%, really solid. That was on an extraordinary comp of 23% from Q1 '24 a year ago. And so as you said, solid ongoing double-digits on double-digits growth there. And look, it is, it's a combination of new patients. We're seeing new patient flow to be pretty solid into the system. It's a combination of that plus ReSupply. We are expanding Brightree ReSupply. We're expanding Snap to every Brightree customer that wants it. We actually said three weeks ago at our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange, we're going to launch Snap Technologies even to non-Brightree customers. We're going to make it operable with whatever ERP-type management system you're using for your HME. We've got a really good share with Brightree, but if you're not using Brightree, we don't have to convert to Brightree, although we want to -- we to put you on Snap. And so that's a new advance there on ReSupply. So runway left there. Yes, I think the masks per patient per year is going up, but there is still a lot of room. I think there's a lot of people. I mean, I talk to them anecdotally, but if you go out and do your channel checks and research, not everybody knows that reimbursement will pay for two, three, or even four mask systems per year and some people are still getting one mask system per year or less. And so there's a lot of room to improve. Some people are on those programs and they love it and they get on the subscription ones. I love it because it's an overlap of altruism with the profit motive. The only reason someone is going to buy a new mask is if they're getting good care and pay that co-pay and go through the sign-off that they have to do. So really good growth there of 10% in U.S., Canada, and Latin America. But I'm also really proud of Europe, Asia, and rest of world, where we don't have all those systems like Brightree and Snap Technologies and all the sort of sophistication that we have with our U.S. HME channel partners. And we have to do it sort of through different methodologies and subscription models and/or direct engagement through home care providers or direct engagement to the consumers, the patients themselves. And so global growth of 11% really solid. Look, we still see the market growth as mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. But what you saw is this quarter, ResMed doesn't accept market growth, we drive it. And the third part you said around share, yes, look, this isn't carbonated beverages industry in Coke versus Pepsi or McDonald's versus KFC. This is really around expanding the pie. And so, yes, we've done very well in share, have extraordinary good share in AirSense 10, AirSense 11, and our new masks, the F40, great share there in full phase and I think we'll continue to take some points. But for me, it's less about that, I want to do that. Every day, we fight for share of devices and masks. But more and more, it's about 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. And we're really happy to say we've sold 28 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices. That's 2.8% of the potential, throw in the rest of the market, we're less than 5% into this global market. And so our biggest opportunity is getting more patients into the funnel. I'm loving that big tech from the consumer side and big pharma are going to bring more patients in and that's ResMed's job to help those people find the pathway through as I said in the prep remarks. That's how we'll be able to sustain the sort of as we said in our Investor Day, high-single-digit growth for ResMed and then better growth than that in terms of our profit and better growth in that in our free cash flow and earnings per share. Thanks for the question, David.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Good morning. Good afternoon, Mick and Brett. Can you hear me?
Michael Farrell: Hear you loud and clear, Saul.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks, Mick. Maybe one for Brett. Brett, just on working capital, it looked like it was a bit of a headwind this quarter as it related to your operating cash flow and in particular some inventory build. Can you just talk to -- is there sort of just seasonality in this? Is it just some inventory build as it relates to new product launch or any other issues that you're seeing as it relates to the cost of that inventory that's coming through the balance sheet? Thank you.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Saul. Yes, a little bit of increase in our inventory, if you looked at it sequentially on the working capital. What we've done is we're really in the process of rebalancing on sea freight, air freight and particularly trying to mitigate some of those increased freight costs and freight rates. So we've increased some stock in transit, which is on the sea, which is increasing our inventory levels in the short term. There may be a little more of an increase in Q2, but then we think it will be pretty stable after that. It's just a process of balancing that. So part of what we're trying to do to mitigate some of those freight costs.
Saul Hadassin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho. Hope your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter, and thanks again for all the feedback at the Analyst Day. Maybe a quick one, Mick, on pricing, Mick or Brett. Last year, you put in some price increases, both devices and ReSupply and I think we're approaching the anniversary of a few of those price actions last year. So maybe just a little bit on the pricing strategy going forward. Is that going to be a part of the steady diet? And if I could sneak one in there as well, just U.S. DME purchasing patterns, are they holding more inventory and buying more in bulk just because of the supply situation out there? Thanks again, and congratulations.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at both questions. And Brett, feel free to chime in. Anthony is opening up for both of us. But firstly on pricing strategy, look, as we saw during the supply-chain crisis, the impacts on electrical components availability and cost and specifically around semiconductors and comms chips, some really specific price increases we saw from our channel. And as Brett alluded to in his last answer, increase in freight costs -- air freight costs and availability and sea freight costs and availability over the last four, eight, 12 quarters have really flowed into our inventory and had a big hit on us. And so -- and we took that hit. Four, five quarters ago, you saw us take significant hits from that. We are working through that. And so look, as we worked with our customers, we shared some of the pain of those price increases that we saw. We took some of the hit, frankly at ResMed as the market saw and we passed on some of that in saying, look, these costs have gone up. They've gone up for everything, forever, bread, milk, bananas, fruits. I mean, it's happened. And frankly, it's interesting to me on the retail side, not all of them have lowered their prices as things have started to come down. Here at ResMed, look, we're in the healthcare industry. We understand this is controlled reimbursement many countries by governments and private payers. And so we partner up with our channel to say, look, what's happening. And so we shared some of that pain there. I think things are starting to level out somewhat as you saw in our costs. We're managing air freight better, sea freight better. We're moving our way through those high-cost components. We're always wary of what could happen with Red Sea issues and Panama Canal issues and even a seaport threat of a union strike just last month. And so we're watching it with a productive sense of paranoia. But what I can tell you is, Shane Azzi, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer is all over this, and we've got plans to mitigate and Brett led that group the last six months. So really good communication between our finance team and our supply chain team. So we're all over this. And I think in terms of pricing, sure, you will see some maybe increases in pricing in components and parts where the costs are still high. I'm thinking like tubing and humidifiers in areas where there is just relatively higher costs relative to where we price them. But in general, I think it will be a benign pricing environment. To the second question about U.S. HME purchasing patterns. No, we really haven't seen any sort of across the market change in how that happens. I mean, there are customers like in Japan, particularly with our large customers there, they tend to buy large bulk purchases and then work through sort of an inventory fleet management system, if you think for the CPAPs, APAPs, and buy levels and certainly on the ventilators and certainly on the mask side, they then have some level of inventory stocking in Japan. But in the U.S., even the large customers, we partner up very well. We look at our supply chain, they don't want to hold excess inventory. We don't want to hold excess inventory. So as we can, it's not a just-in-time market. I worked in chemicals and steel and mining industries where it was just-in-time minimum available and just make sure it's just there in time. This is healthcare. If somebody misses out on that product, they may not get a life-changing healthcare technology. So we want to make sure it's available. As Brett said, we have some levels of inventory reasonably high, but we are looking at efficiency of the supply chain for us and our customers. So no major change in U.S. HME purchasing patterns. And our goal is to make sure that it's as just-in-time as possible with no patient left behind.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Daniel Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.
Daniel Hurren: Good morning. Thanks very much. Look, we've noticed that the term tuck. Sorry, can you hear me?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Got you loud and clear, Dan.
Daniel Hurren: Thanks. Thanks, Mick. Look, we've noticed that this term tuck-in acquisition has become very common in your commentary. And then in the presentation, you pointed out the $1.5 billion in debt capacity. So I was hoping you could talk just to the M&A priorities and the scale of the M&A priorities, I guess, and how you think about capital management as the free cash really start to ramp up over the next 12 months as that debt is retired.
Michael Farrell: Okay, Dan. Well, I'll take the first part of that question about tuck-in M&A and I'll hand it to Brett to talk about capital management more broadly as our CFO and he sleeps and breathes that. In terms of tuck-in acquisitions, obviously, I'm not going to go into details of our radar and what we're looking at, and conversations we're having. But what I will talk about is what we've done in terms of successful tuck-in acquisitions. So if you look at what we did sort of around three, four years ago with Snap Technologies, that was a tuck-in acquisition. It was de-minimis in terms of the number. I don't think we even published the number. It was relatively small in terms of our annual cash flow. But what it did was it gave us the ability to engage with HMEs and engage with their customers, the patients in ways that we hadn't ever before and brought new technology. So it improved both Brightree's sort of Residential Care Software as a service business, but it also improved our core sleep health and breathing health business by making sure people when they wanted a new mask could easily and capably get approval, co-pays made, all the Is dotted and Ts cross for the healthcare system and then get the product needed that they could get. So we are absolutely out there on the lookout for acquisitions like Snap. Another tuck-in acquisition I'll talk about is called Somnoware. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and sleep medicine physician practices across the respiratory sections, so sleep apnea, COPD, and beyond, all sort of sleep health and breathing health. Again, de-minimis in that we didn't release the total number, we didn't need to, but we got amazing capabilities with that acquisition. A team of engineers here in the U.S. and in India and actually a great entrepreneur in Subath, who joined our team. I first met him at a SLEEP meeting maybe 15 years ago. And he said, I think at that time, you're going to need us, you're going to buy our technology. And he was right. It was a decade and a half later, but that was a great tuck-in acquisition and Subath has the office right next door to me and he's looking at our incubation and growth and looking at tuck-in acquisitions that are just like the company that he had. So he's out there at conferences like Health and CES along with Carlos Nunez and the rest of our team to look out what those tuck-ins might be. But Somnoware allows us to engage with pulmonary doctors earlier and earlier on this sort of end-to-end digital sleep health concierge process that ResMed wants to be. We're getting earlier and earlier in that with our Somnoware acquisition. The final one I'll talk about, I could talk all day on it, but our final one for this is a tuck-in M&A that we did of a technology from a company called Ectosense and the technology is called NightOwl. And I actually just talked in the prep remarks about how we've just integrated NightOwl with myAir, the myAir platform, the patient consumer app, and NightOwl. NightOwl is a home sleep apnea test that is basically a wearable. I mean, it's the size of a band-aid with a sensor that goes on your finger. And with that connected to your smartphone, we can get very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity and specificity are well higher than you get from some of these other wearables I talked about from consumer tech companies because we're doing different things. They're both FDA, 510 cleared devices, but ours is designed to be a diagnostic, a home sleep apnea test that can be a diagnostic, and a prescription written from a pulmonary physician. Great tuck-in acquisition. Again, we didn't release the number, it was relatively small and that's why it's a tuck-in. But that technology is scaled by ResMed in 140 countries and we're just ready to relaunch it here in the U.S. market. I think the timing couldn't be better because if Samsung and Apple get these people thinking, oh, possible sleep apnea from my phone or maybe I've got this moderate sleep apnea infection, where do I go? Well, guess what? They go to a primary care physician or they go to a sleep physician and then we need digital scalable models for them. So a product like NightOwl helps with that. And we're creating not just in our own diagnostics, but a portfolio of capabilities with other diagnostics companies and service providers in the U.S. and beyond because that digital sleep health concierge is an obligation for ResMed. People are going to come with problems of sleep health and breathing health. We don't want them waiting in a do-loop. We want them taken care of. So they are the sort of three examples of tuck-in acquisitions and more to come on that. Brett, in terms of capital allocation, any thoughts to share with Dan on a broader level?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. And Dan, when you think about the tuck-ins we've got and Mick articulated some great examples, which we think are going to add a ton of value over time, and we're continuously looking at these sort of acquisitions. But in terms of quantum tuck-in, I guess, that's fairly broad, $100 million -- $200 million, it could be given our balance sheet and size now, it could be up to $500 million, Dan. It just depends what the acquisitions strategically like, financially like, culturally like, and then what sort of capability it can bring into ResMed and how we might leverage that. So we think pretty hard about it before we actually make the acquisition. But it's been really good acquisitions over the last two or three years and there's more out there as the market continues to develop. So anything in that range, I think we would look at. And then the other side on capital management and you heard my comments earlier, we will increase the buyback each quarter going forward and that obviously remains a lever for us going forward. So that's kind of the two areas, I guess, will -- well, three really. Fundamentally R&D investment where we get -- that's the greatest return we get. We'll look at, as Mick said, we'll look at the tuck-in acquisitions and then we'll do some capital management as well. That's kind of the three areas of focus.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Mike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to ask one. So with the new - on masks with the new N30i with that fabric over the straps, is that a technology that you can apply to other masks in your portfolio? And then is that something that you're able to get a price premium for?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a great question, Mike, and thanks for coming to our Investor Day. You were able to touch and see that product because I think you've really got to touch and see what the AirTouch N30i is. It's in its name, right? It's an AirTouch. That fabric is -- it's extraordinarily advanced technology. As I said, we've been looking for a decade at fabrics and how to get them at scale and with efficacy on a mask that could be ResMed quality, and we were able to bring that to market. To your question, can we apply that technology to other masks? Absolutely. I think this is a game changer and it changes the basis of competition for how patient interfaces are delivered from plastics and rubbers sort of medical-type products that you might find in a hospital to ones that you might find at home. People sleep on cotton or silk fabric sheets. They have a cotton-covered pillow. They don't sleep on plastic, why should that part be delivering care on your face? If we can get the pneumatic stent at safety, efficacious, and long-term capability. But to your question, yes, it is a higher cost. It's more difficult to have these machinery robotics and scalable systems that can do this even with ResMed having the biggest manufacturing footprint on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine, sleep health, and breathing health, it's costs are still higher with a new technology like this. So pricing will be slightly higher for these types of products because the costs are higher. But I think what you'll find is that first-time fit rates will go up, that return rates will go down, and that adherence rates will go up. As we do with all our technology, that's the goal, lower the cost of the overall healthcare system, improve adherence, which means less chances of heart attack, stroke, less chances of death as we've shown in the Alaska study for patients who are adherent on CPAP versus not. And we think that these types of improvements will have a huge return on investment for the patient, for the physician, for the provider as we launch them to market. So yes, the AirTouch N30i is coming out. It will have a price premium because it's got a higher cost. We can't take it to other masks and we will over time. But early days, we're just launching it next week. Lots of interest and excitement from our commercial team and the customers who sort of got a sneak preview and we're excited about AirTouch N30i and what it can do more broadly across the world.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Brett Fishbin: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the macro tailwind around the wearable tech platforms. You've talked about it a bunch at the Investor Day and then again on today's call. I was just curious if you could maybe touch on a few potential strategies that the company could be looking at that would best position ResMed to capture potential increases in new patient demand driven by the adoption of these technologies. Thank you so much for taking the question.
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a great question, Brett. I mean, it's a complex answer. It could take all of the eight minutes we got less left on the call and longer. But as you heard in the sort of four-hour overview that we gave on our Investor Day three weeks ago, there is lots of things we're doing in this. The broad categories are demand generation, demand capture, and demand conversion, three areas. Now if big tech and big pharma are taking on some of that demand gen, right, driving people into PCPs, driving people into our specialist sleep physicians, then what we have to do at ResMed is take the next phase in that. So what we have to do is have products like Dawn, our generative AI interaction format that can talk and engage with patients to help them if they've just got sleep health questions about getting better sleep, drinking more water, exercising more, less alcohol after certain times, less caffeine after certain times, different food and timing of food intake, all these types of broader sleep health can be conducted by a bot at levels that are just human banks of callers don't have time for and don't spend as much time on and people can be embarrassed to ask some questions about sleep health and breathing health. There's a stigma associated with all healthcare and that's why companies like Hims & Hers and all these other type of digital platforms are out there and achieving some success. And so ResMed wants to be that digital sleep health concierge. And the -- as I said, the answer is complex. It's more than just DAN, it's more than just Somnoware, it's more than just myAir, it's more than just AirView and the whole combination. But it is those components and it's how you stitch them together and how you create that seamless, frictionless end-to-end experience for a person. Let's not call them a consumer. Let's not call them a patient. Let's say it's a person who suffocates and is looking for their own care, all their spouse and bed partners care. And so we're really focused on this and we think these macro trends are going to drive patients in, consumers in, persons in. And ResMed's job is to do the best job at demand capture and demand conversion. We've got many experiments around 140 countries and we'll update you. It's not going to be a one-hit wonder, oh, here we got the panacea and it's this. No, there's going to be multiple attempts in different areas, different MSAs, different technologies, different healthcare systems. Every person is different. All of the 1 billion people with sleep apnea, the 2.3 billion with sleep apnea or insomnia or COPD or some combination of the above with respiratory insufficiency, they all need an individualized personalized pathway to better sleep, better health, and better health technology at home. So ResMed's goal is to capture across that with a combination of technologies. And as we launch them and as the experiments are successful, we'll let you know. I want to be clear, this isn't just about brand awareness and brand driving. This is about brand ROI, return on investment that we show the experiments are successful that the people see the ResMed brand, they engage with them and then they find a path to better sleep health and breathing health. And we're best positioned globally to do this with our market share and capability. If we did nothing, we'd get good share. I think our goal and our obligation is to do a lot and to drive more patients in and to help them find that best path that they can have. Thanks for the question, Brett. And sorry to trivialize the answer with only a four-minute answer, but we probably got time for a couple of more questions.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Hi, Mick, Brett, hope you're well. So my congrats…
Michael Farrell: Thanks very much, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Congrats on a great quarter. Mick, I want to piggyback on Anthony's question, right? So your normal -- your nominal growth right now is a perfect trifecta of pushing more ReSupply masks to patient price increases. And I believe Brett mentioned something about a little bit of inventory also to cater to patients just in time. Mick, as we think forward, how do you -- how would you say ResMed is buffered from a potentially more price-sensitive environment if and when Philips returns to the market? Thank you for taking my questions and congrats again.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Suraj. Look, as you said, there is some really interesting overlays between our more masks and the technology we're bringing to market, our pricing strategies, and our inventory management strategies. With regard to the competitor you mentioned, look, as I said, we just announced pretty good growth in Europe, Asia, rest-of-world, right, 9% growth in devices, 11% growth in masks and accessories. That competitor is available in almost all of the 140 countries we're in, and they've been there for many, many, many quarters. And so love them. I love to compete with them. I love to beat them. I do the same with all the other competitors. I love the players from Europe and Asia. Competition is a fantastic thing for ResMed. We love it. It keeps us on our toes. And we were beating that particular competitor all the way from 2001 through to 2021 as they had the recall in the U.S. in devices, which is the only area, right? So we've been ongoing competition with them in masks the whole time and they've been out for a couple of years, two to three years now in devices. Look, I look forward to them coming back here. They'll have to fight for that number two, number three position against some other players with importing product from China and Europe that they've sort of taken that number two, number three position. And I think they've got to set up new manufacturing and get new sales team and I look forward to them coming back. We will be beating them before their recall and we will beat them after. But look, I don't spend that much time or my time looking back at the competition from Europe or Asia or that particular player from Europe. I look more forward and I think about these macro trends and what we can do to take care because this isn't just a share game. What we've got is a sustainable competitive advantage in a digital health ecosystem that patients engaging with myAir, doctors engaging with AirView and more importantly, consumers, persons who just suffocate coming in, they don't know where they want to go. We want to help them find that pathway and be objective about it and then they will choose the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent therapies. That's how ResMed competes and that's how ResMed wins.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning all and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Can you comment a little bit on the production of AirSense 11? You mentioned you're increasing and you're targeting it to come off allocation at the end of this calendar year. Is that still on track? And then also, can you comment on the mix of AS11 to AS10 devices that you're selling in the United States? And do you have a sense that there might be a [rePAP] backlog waiting for the AirSense 11 still?
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne. Yes, there is a lot in that question and we're almost right on time. We may have one more question I think. So yes, as you said, production of AirSense 11 is firing on all cylinders. Our Singapore plant, which as I said earlier, is the largest manufacturing plant in the world for respiratory medical care that thing is pumping out and really at full capacity. And I'm really excited to have AirSense 11s coming off that line and AirSense 10s coming out of there in Sydney and beyond and through Atlanta and through our distribution centers throughout Asia and Europe. And so to your specific question, AirSense 11 firing and really, really strong rate limiters to growth are just that we're the number one and number two player between AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 in many of these markets. And so there is a mix, as you said. In the U.S. specifically, you asked Lyanne, well over 50%, vast majority of products sold in the U.S. are AirSense 11s. To the final part of your question, do we think that there are people sort of at that, oh, I've been on therapy for five years and insurance will pay for a new one, I'm waiting until AirSense 11 is available? Yes, maybe some -- a little bit of a backlog with some particular consumers. But if you really want one, a consumer at that level might be going to one of the online dealers or looking at other ways to make sure they get in line for an AirSense 11. So I think there's always a bit of a backlog. I always think that rePAP opportunity is huge for us. We don't spend enough time on it. Our customers don't spend enough time on it. We've gotten really sophisticated at ongoing ReSupply for masks, tubing, and accessories. I think we need to be better at rePAP on a regular basis. And so it's a good call out and the team are on it with many things going on to make sure that as we get full AirSense 11 capabilities, everyone who's at that five-year point gets the chance to say, yes, I want the latest and greatest therapy, smallest, quietest most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent, and that's the AirSense 11. So we will continue to do that. As I said in the prep remarks, I think there's a long runway, lots of momentum left on the AirSense 11.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now live.
Andrew Paine: Question, look just going back to the rest of world devices and just thinking about the AE sales, just be good to get some views on competition that you're seeing in the region, in particular, if you're seeing a declining presence from Philips in some of these markets, which would open you up to taking larger market share?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, look, we're competing with another particular European player, probably a little bit more than the one you mentioned, but we're competing with both of them very well as you saw with Europe, Asia, rest of world device growth at 9%. We don't break that out and say exactly what component of that is Europe versus Asia-Pac versus rest of world and we did have very good growth in our Japan markets and China markets and other parts of Asia-Pac. But Europe is doing very well. As I said, I'm really proud of the team there. We've really brought together our pan-European management team over these last 12 months under our Global Chief Revenue Officer, Mike Fliss, and our regional leader there in Andrew Huxter. And I think that combination of communication and partnership across our team has allowed us to provide customers even more seamless and better service, better marketing, better sales, better delivery of products. And we've not always been the best in that final mile of delivery, that final kilometer of delivery that we need to have in Europe and we're getting better and better at it. So I think it's a combination of the products, AirSense 11, the communication through our commercial teams, and the supply chain and logistics that we're really partnering up with customers that have allowed us to achieve that. The competitive environment is what it always was, but as you see in those numbers, ResMed is doing well, competing hard and winning accounts, winning tenders, and winning share. But more importantly than that, we're partnering up to ensure a good flow of patients into the funnel. That's ResMed's primary goal, more patients into the funnel, help them get best-in-class care. Thank you for the questions, team. I'll now hand the call over to Kevin.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Mick, do you have any further or closing comments?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Look, I got the prepared remarks here, I'm not going to say all that. Thanks to 10,000 ResMedians, 140 countries, you guys are doing amazing things. Thank you to all our shareholders for the support. Incredible quarter. Let's power up and let's do it again for another 90 days. And with that, Amy, I'll hand over to you to close out the call.
End of Q&A:
Amy Wakeham: Awesome. Thank you, Mick. Thank you everyone for listening, for your questions, and we do appreciate your interest. If you have follow-up questions or need anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude our first quarter 2025 conference call. Kevin, you may now close the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-08-01 21:45:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on our reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Thanks Amy, and thank you to our shareholders for joining us as we announce results from our full fiscal year 2024 and review our fourth quarter results in more detail. Our global ResMed team executed incredibly well in our fourth quarter, producing another strong period of growth and execution across our business. With solid performance across all regions and all segments of our business and strong double-digit bottom-line growth. Ongoing new patient demand for our market leading flow generators remained robust in the quarter, even against a very tough year-over-year comparable. Media interest in sleep apnea and all the various therapies seems to be helping patients find their way to screening, diagnosis and therapy. And especially the lowest cost, most efficacious therapy with the best outcomes, which is positive airway pressure therapy. In terms of our masks and accessories, business physicians, respiratory therapists and patients are choosing ResMed masks when they start therapy and as they continue through resupply, resulting in very strong double-digit growth in our masks and accessories business. Our residential care software business delivered double-digit growth in revenue and in net operating profit. Our laser focus on operating leverage has delivered another quarter of strong, profitable growth and we're well positioned to continue on this trajectory as we launch into fiscal year 2025. Over 2.4 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. As the market leader in respiratory medicine and residential care globally, here at ResMed, we're uniquely positioned to drive increased market penetration through demand generation to accelerate growth. These chronic conditions in sleep health and breathing health form a global health epidemic that ResMed is well positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible, in the optimal case, that's right, in a person's own home. ResMed is the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We're leading the industry in digital health solutions, with approximately 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and 26 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We've leveraged these de-identified data to show that our therapy solutions lower costs, improve outcomes and bend the curve of chronic disease progression. Significant opportunities remain in digital health, and we plan to be right there at the cutting edge of innovation. The latest advances in wearables from the consumer technology industry and the latest medicines from big pharmaceutical companies will bring more and more new patients into the healthcare system. We have many opportunities to add value, expanding interoperability, lowering costs and improving patient outcomes. Billions of people can benefit from our products and solutions, and we're focused on expanding our reach and growing the market to help people get on their pathway to better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. Sales of our flow generator devices, including the category leading AirSense 11 platform, grew 6% year-over-year globally. We're supporting the global market and every patient who needs a device has access to our market leading 100% cloud connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We continue increasing the availability and production of our AirSense 11 and our AirCurve11 platforms worldwide as we secure regulatory clearances and launch these market leading technologies country by country. Our masks and accessories business grew 15% year-over-year, expanding in a competitive category globally. Our latest mask innovation, the AirFit F40, introduced last quarter, is doing extremely well in the markets that it has launched in. New patients are selecting the F40 for its comfort, fit and ease of use. It is the smallest profile oronasal mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets, and respiratory therapists are voting with their setup protocols, and physicians are voting with their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the US and across global markets as we increase availability and introduce the F40 into more and more countries throughout fiscal year 2025. ResMed's clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients, and we're successfully establishing subscription programs in our cash pay countries to help consumers find their path to therapy with resupply directly. Masks and accessory resupply programs are a very important part of our offering as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally, research shows that resupply programs can both improve patient adherence and improve long-term clinical outcomes. In the US our resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies and programs to help people take control of their own health, regularly refreshing their ongoing therapy needs. As the global leader in significantly underpenetrated markets, our most important opportunity is to expand and grow the market through awareness, diagnosis and seamless pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better residential care. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to raise awareness and create pathways for patients to help them find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health. We're serving traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective, social media driven, demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their sleep and breathing, find ways their own personal way into appropriate screening, diagnosis, treatment and management pathways. Our physician and provider-based software ecosystem called AirView now contains over 28 million patient records. Adoption of our consumer patient engagement app, which is called myAir, where people choose to participate in their personalized sleep health journey, remains incredibly active and now includes over 8.3 million users. These digital health ecosystems are growing every quarter, showing the engagement of physicians as well as patients in accessing their own data to measure progress along their personal health journey. As we look to the future, I've discussed two global megatrends that I believe will further support ongoing growth for ResMed. Awareness of sleep health issues driven by consumer technology companies, specifically, sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch, which has a De Novo FDA clearance to screen for moderate to severe sleep apnea. And we expect similar capabilities from other wearable players in consumer tech such as the Apple Watch, Google's Fitbit, the Oura Ring, WHOOP and Garmin. In terms of the second megatrend behind future patient growth, we are seeing increased volumes of patients entering the healthcare system driven by the efforts of big pharmaceutical companies as they increase awareness of the treatments for diabetes and obesity medicines and they continue their research into the impacts of these medicines on sleep apnea. Together, we believe these two mega trends in consumer tech and big pharma will increase patient awareness and be a significant tailwind for long term growth here at ResMed, our goal is to educate people as they move from what we call sleep wellness tracking on a wearable to what we would call sleep health tracking, where they are seeking the help, advice and care of a health professional in the field of sleep medicine. This connection pathway from consumer awareness of sleep health and breathing health issues into a true healthcare pathway is what we are calling the digital health concierge opportunity. Our plan is to be there for that person as they go through the process of screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their sleep health and their breathing health for life. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications. For many people dealing with their obesity and diabetes issues, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, cardiovascular exercise and their sleep routines, something that Bill Dement called the triumvirate of health. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive to achieve and maintain weight loss. We believe this will open them up to treating other chronic diseases that they may suffer from, including increased awareness of sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that they may not have previously considered or been treated for. So, it's not just driving more patients into our channel, but we believe it's also driving more motivated patients. The emphasis on GLP-1 medications and increased focus by Big Pharma has put a spotlight on sleep apnea like never before. We believe that the growth in weight loss drugs will be a net positive for our business and the data support that thesis. ResMed has added to the biggest study in the field and our data which is using real world evidence of the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis leveraging third party claims data. We now have an expanded cohort of over 811,000 de-identified subjects in our analysis. This analysis demonstrates that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients both seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we have presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.7 absolute percentage points higher propensity to start PAP therapy over those without a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that patients with this drug prescription are more motivated to start their CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy. In terms of longer-term impacts on PAP therapy, we have seen that the resupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points, so 3.1 absolute percentage points higher for the patients who have a GLP-1 prescription and further at T equals 24 months, the resupply rate is 530 basis points, or 5.3 absolute percentage points higher for PAP therapy resupply for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show that the new pharmaceutical class is a clear tailwind for our business, bringing more patients into the healthcare system. And more than that, we believe it is bringing highly motivated patients into the healthcare system. We've included this updated analysis in our quarterly earnings PowerPoint deck and I encourage you to review the data there in further detail. ResMed is the clear world leader in sleep health, breathing health and healthcare delivered at home. Frankly, it's our obligation and it's our brand promise. It's the ResMed brand promise to ensure that sleep concerned consumers find their path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost and most comfortable therapy that's out there and it's best for them. Our peer reviewed and published evidence demonstrates that we can achieve over 87% to PAP technology, 87% adherence to PAP technology in the first 90 days by combining our market leading device platforms with digital health solutions, myAir and AirView. Of course, that means that 13% of patients in that scenario still need alternatives and ResMed wants to be there to help those patients too. So, we are investing in alternative therapies to help patients who can't adhere to PAP therapy to find their pathway to second line therapies. And that includes dental devices where ResMed provides Narval, the market leading 3D printed dental device for treatment of sleep apnea with dental treatment in western and northern Europe. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options with our investment in ApneaMed and hyperglossal nerve stimulation technology with our investment in NIC SOA. So, let's step back and talk about broadly our digital health technology investments. Leveraging an extraordinary ecosystem of almost 19 billion nights of de-identified medical data, we are developing and continue to expand our portfolio of artificial intelligence driven capabilities, as well as customer facing AI products that we're launching into the market from our ecosystem. We continue to roll out and expand the AI products in AirView such as compliance coach in the United States and our new smart coaching pilot which is expanding into a few new countries as we go through our current quarter, which is Q1 of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We are also progressing with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their health journey. A project that was initially piloted within our Asia Pacific region, our generative AI sleep concierge that we call Dawn and yes, that is a reference to the sun rising at dawn after a great night of sleep. Dawn was recently expanded from Asia Pac into our US market. We'll continue to share the progress on this front of GenAI and simple ML and generic AI as well, as this tech is further developed and scaled across our business. It's going to enhance the user experience and drive consumer awareness and what we're focused on is outcomes, not the tech, but what it can do for a patient, a physician, a provider. In our residential care software as a service business, we had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 10%, supported by strength in our home medical equipment provider business through our Brightree brand, as well as very strong growth in our home nursing and nursing home business with our MEDIFOX DAN brand. We've made very good progress in the business segment throughout fiscal 2024 and we plan to maintain high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth throughout each quarter in fiscal year 2025. But really importantly, we're driving operating leverage and we're going to have very strong double-digit net operating profit growth from our residential care software business sector in 2025. Our residential care software business is integral to the broader ResMed growth portfolio with ongoing synergistic growth opportunities across our businesses. We are accelerating growth across our residential care software business intrinsically, but we're also helping to support the core business through mask and accessory resupply growth. We continue to drive operating leverage by managing across our businesses with capabilities managed such as cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and research and development velocity across our software platforms and with our core sleep, health and breathing health businesses. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care software at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across the 140 plus countries that we serve. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We're focused on driving top line revenue growth, but with strong cost discipline and increasing efficiencies to accelerate profitability at the bottom line. We made excellent progress on that this quarter. The global team delivered growth in non-GAAP operating income of 30%. The global team also delivered growth in non-GAAP net income of 30%. I'm more than incredibly proud of our global team and their performance. We provide differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent technologies. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 178 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, or a complete mask directly to a patient, or a digital health software solution that provides personal care. We've helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to 10,000 plus ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day across 140 countries. Thank you, team. With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO Brett, who's in Sydney this morning for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A with the global team here in San Diego and Sydney. Over to you Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q4 ,group revenue for the June quarter was $1.22 billion, a 9% headline increase and 10% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and resupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a minimal impact on revenue during the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America increased by 10%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other regions increased by 8%. Globally, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 5%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis. Masks and other sales increased by 17%, reflecting growth in both resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other regions, device sales increased by 8% on a constant currency basis and masks and other sales increased by 9% on a constant currency basis. Software as a service revenue increased by 10% in the June quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 330 basis points to 59.1% in the June quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing and component cost improvements, favourable product mix and an increase in average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 60 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing cost improvements partially offset by increased freight costs. We continue to monitor the freight cost headwinds arising from the Middle east, conflict and congestion in Asian ports. We expect increased freight cost rates will continue to impact our gross margin in fiscal year 2025. We have made good progress expanding gross margin over the last several quarters and we will continue to drive initiatives to improve gross margin. Looking forward, we estimate our gross margin will be in the range of 59% to 60% in fiscal year 2025. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year 2025. Consistent with historical trends, we expect Q1 FY '25 will be at the higher end of this range. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to 7% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2025. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 30%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was 6 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense in the range of $1 million to $3 million in Q1 FY '25. Additionally, we will likely generate net interest income in the second half of fiscal year 2025. During the quarter, we recognized unrealized losses of $15 million associated with our minority investment portfolio. This reduced our Q4 earnings per share by $0.10. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.7%. Broadly consistent with the prior year quarter, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 30% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 30%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $440 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $25 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. During the quarter, we reduced debt by $300 million. As of June 30, we had $707 million in gross debt and $469 million in net debt. And we have approximately $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position. Today, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, representing an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. During the quarter, we purchased 232,000 shares under our previously authorised share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares the value of approximately $50 million per quarter in fiscal year 2025. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions, and continue with our share buyback program. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thanks, everyone. Kevin, I'd like to turn the call back over to you to review the Q&A instructions and run that portion of the call.
Operator: Certainly with that be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Can I start with devices that came in a little bit lower than what I had expected? And can you give us some color? In terms of that 6% increase in device revenues? How much of that do you think is driven by November price increases? How much is the AX 11 mixed benefit? And how much of that is volume? And then on volume, are you seeing any change in that new start pipeline coming through?
Michael Farrell: Well, thanks for your question, Lyanne. That lets me talk through our really strong growth I believe in our devices business. Just to refresh in Q4 fiscal year '23 just 12 short months ago we were talking about US device growth of 30% and Europe, Asia, rest of world growth of 15%. So incredible double-digit comps that we're building these numbers off and we saw really good growth in the US of 5% growth in our US, Canada, Latin America and we saw 8% growth in Europe, Asia, rest of the world. We're in full competition with all the players out there and as you said, 6% constant currency globally. Look, you know, the market is growing in that mid-single digits and we are holding share or gaining share. But really now as the global market leader, our primary focus is on demand generation. Where are their capacities in the field for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management? That we can drive appropriate demand generation not to overflow the channel, but to make sure that any spare capacity in screening, diagnosis and treatment and management can come through. So, I was very impressed by those numbers. I think they're right in line with market and slightly ahead in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And I think the team did incredibly well. And we're doing it through patient flow, which is very strong. And yes, there are some ASP changes in there. They're kind of small. Our costs have gone up, and we did have some adjustments to pricing over the last 12 months. But the primary generator here is the flow of patients, which, as I said in the prep remarks, we're seeing really good flow of patients. And our job as the global market leader is to continue to have that grow and grow even faster as we go throughout the fiscal years ahead. Thanks for your question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is out live.
Steven Wheen : Yeah thanks. I just had a question with regards to the gross margin. The -- are you going to quantify the freight-related expectations that you would have for the next quarter. And are you being able to introduce rate levies again given the spike in sea freight charges at the moment?
Michael Farrell: So, thanks for the question, Steve. I'll hand that over to Brett to cover some issues around GM and really good accretion of our gross margin year-on-year and sequentially, Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, Steve, we're seeing -- I mean, we're seeing pressure on freight cost, particularly around the rates, the quite significant increases. I think everyone's seen those. So that is obviously, will continue to be a headwind for us, but we think notwithstanding that, we should be in that 59% to 60% range on gross margin. There's a lot of factors, as you know, play into that. But the freight will be a headwind. In terms of -- really, I guess it depends how whether it's sort of permanent or transitory and see how the market goes in terms of freight that obviously, those costs we're bearing at the moment. So, what we do going forward, I think, is something we'll think about as the year goes on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Brett Fishbin: Hey guys, how are you doing? Thank you so much for taking the questions. Wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the gross margin question just now. Just thinking about some of the year-over-year trend, it looks like 2024 is finishing at about 57.7%, and you're guiding to 59% to 60%. So maybe if you could just walk through some of the positive incremental drivers relative to how we're exiting the second half year? And you already touched on the freight as a partial offset? Thank you.
Michael Farrell: So Brett, back to you, gross margin.
Brett Sandercock : Yes, sure. The -- you -- to clarify, you talking into the future gross margins?
Brett Fishbin: Specifically, just asking about some of the commentary for FY '25 relative to FY '24.
Brett Sandercock : Yes, going forward. So going forward, I guess there's some factors at play out on the gross margin. Some of these big positive. We talked about freight, which will be a headwind. But if you -- if we look forward, we have cost optimization initiatives that we're getting back to now, whereas previously, we were really just trying to meet demand and catching up. But now we're getting back to running a more regular cost optimization programs. So, we'll do that. We're building the pipeline of those initiatives, that will be around manufacturing improvements and efficiencies. It will be around the procurement initiatives than what we do there. And also, we'll get -- with the volumes we have now, we'll also get scale benefits coming through. So, they're kind of the areas, I guess, we look at in terms of cost optimization in supply chain. Other factors the continued transition to the AS 11 platform will be supportive of gross margin into FY '25. We think product mix will likely be favorable through the course of FY '25, that will be supportive. And I guess the last one is just around new product introductions as you introduce new products that helps with less discounting and you're able to price that according to the features and the value of those products. So, there are some of the factors, I think that will play out in FY '25.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Michael Matson: Yeah, thanks. So, I guess, first, I just want to ask about Philips. Have you seen them reentering any of the international markets in any meaningful way with devices specifically?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, our -- I guess I'll call them our #4 competitor right now, right, because they've dropped down to fourth in new patient share globally. That competitor is back in many markets in Europe Asia and Rest of World, we grew in the quarter, 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of the world on a comp of 15%. So, if you see which I do, the market growing in mid-single digits. ResMed is taking share in Europe, Asia, rest of the world relative to our competition. So, competitors from Europe like the one you named, but there's other ones that have higher share and competitors from Asia who have higher shares than them. And so, I think that competitor as they come back are having to earn their way back. We've got to try to repair their brand, try to repair their approach that they're going to have a safe and efficacious product, and they're competing with the Tier 2, Tier 3 players and working their way in. They had a call last week, and they sound like they're growing from a very low base to something better, and that's good on them. I love competition. ResMed is the market leader. We have the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable devices, but more important than that, they're the most connected and the most intelligent and it's all about the ecosystem of AirView and myAir and getting those data to the cloud and getting to doctors, getting to physicians. So yes, that competitor is back in a number of markets. And as we said last quarter, the quarter before, we were beating them from 2010 to 2019, 2020 before they had the recall, and we're going to beat them as they come back and we've shown that this quarter, and we'll continue to show it going forward.
Michael Matson: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee, your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about that mask growth and the impact of the new products. And specifically, does that strong growth are reflective of an element of initial stocking? Or is that level of growth representative of what the new products can sustain?
Michael Farrell: Look, it's a good question because we talk about mask growth being high single digits. And then obviously, in this quarter. We performed right there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world at 9%, right there in that high single digits. Then in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we performed at 17% growth. On a pretty good comp actually of 19% from the year before. So double digit on double digit. Look, you're not going to grow double digits in masks forever when the market is growing at high single digits, and you are the clear market leader. But you can drive demand generation and you can drive better resupply programs. And I said in the prep remarks, we've done a lot of investment in Brightree, Snap Technologies and all of the digital health technology that we have to support home medical equipment providers here in the U.S. market. And then globally, we've really set up some great subscription programs where people, frankly, I think, have been underserved in Europe, Asia and rest of world with the ability to get fresh equipment if they love their device and they love their mask, why isn't it super simple to just click on an app see the price and get a drop ship delivery of a device to your place in a cash pay market where those same people are doing the same and have done with Amazon and all the other WeChat in China, Amazon, the U.S., et cetera, et cetera, globally. Everyone has seen this in the consumer field. And so I think health care needs to catch up and be more consumer focused and in those cash pay markets. We've set up some great subscription programs. And in the more regulated provider-based markets like the U.S. and Europe, we're really partnering with our providers like never before. So that's how we saw the outperformance. That's how we saw the extra demand generation. That's how we saw the extra resupply. Our goal is to meet or beat market growth every quarter that we go ahead. The team did it really well this quarter, and I have confidence that we'll be able to do it going forward. Thanks for the question about masks. It's a really important part of our business.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Morning. Thanks to -- thanks Mick and Brett. Just thinking about longer-term new patient growth. You sort of mentioned that the awareness piece could potentially increase on the back of some of the GLP-1 studies and data. Just on the diagnosis side of things. Are there any constraints in your view to more new patients coming through. And I suppose I'm getting to -- the question is, when do you think you might see an inflection from or an increase in that sort of mid-single-digit growth to something a little bit higher?
Michael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question, and it's sort of the 3.5 decade question for ResMed, right, which is how do you get people screen diagnosed and treated for a disease, whether they're unconscious when they suffer from it in sleep apnea, being asleep while you have the suffocation. So, education, awareness and better protocols to get patients into the funnel screening diagnosis, treatment and management has been our decades long mission. And look, we did very well, I think, going through COVID and on the other side to apply increases in home sleep apnea testing increases in remote patient monitoring and technology that we've used to help. And so, I do think the big pharma GLP-1 trend is bringing more and more patients in and they're very motivated patients. You saw our latest update on our real-world evidence, 111,000 patients seeing 10.7 absolute percentage points, high propensity to start CPAP. These are very motivated patients over the average patient. And I think that's a big trend. You didn't mention in your question, but I will, David, consumer tech, the wearables. I mean, Samsung dropping the mic there on the other consumer tech companies to say, we've got a de novo clearance to screen for monitor severe sleep apnea from a watch, from the Samsung Galaxy Watch. And I know the Apple Watch has an oximeter on it, and they can do the same. We know Google's Fitbit team have been doing sleep architecture for years. And they will start to recognize many patients with this. So, the real question is not will there be a flow of patients from consumer tech and big pharma. That's going to happen. The real question is, can ResMed really pick up and fight and be the world leader in a digital sleep health concierge to take that sleep concern consumer and help them find a path to a health care specialist to a protocol to a system that gets them screened, diagnosed and treated. We're making good progress on it. We've got a number of experiments globally. We're partnering with an ecosystem of other smaller players out there as well as our own technology in all 140 countries. I can tell you the experiments are happening, and we're seeing some success. The question of the inflection point, look, I do think we can take market growth rate and move it up by 50, 75, 100, maybe even 125 basis points. We're not going to double it. It's a huge, huge global franchise now. Look at our trailing 12 months revenue north of $4.5 billion, but I do think we can move it up 50, 75, 125 basis points by bringing these new technologies that help with that digital sleep pathway. Yes, I'm aware I've got a disease, my watch has told me I'm at risk what do I do about it? ResMed needs to be there to help that person find their pathway through the convoluted frankly, global health care systems to therapy. For those who are coming in the big pharma one, they're already in the health care system. They're going to a primary care physician or a specialist doctor. So that's an even easier route where it's more about education and driving the traditional channels. So we're working both, social media, digital and traditional channels. And together, I do think there's opportunities to accelerate market growth and watch this space. We've done well over the years, and we've learned a lot in these last five years. And now as the global leader, it's our obligation to do this, and we're all over it. Thanks for the question, David.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just back on the gross margin and the guidance of 59% to 60% for FY '25, how should we think about the cadence of that throughout the first half and second half weaker first half, stronger second half given freight or relatively consistent throughout each quarter? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Good question, Gretel. Over to you, Brett. And it feels like this is the after call with modeling. But over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock : Great. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. Yes, I mean, we're at 59.1%, I guess, exit there. I think we've got a 59% to 60% and I think it's probably likely kind of be that gradual improvement as we work through FY '25, I think it's kind of our best estimate at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?
Michael Farrell: Can hear you loud and clear, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Perfect. Congrats on a nice quarter. So, Mick, if I could, I'd love to push you on one of the earlier questions about pricing impact in the quarter. If you could strip out at least give us directionally a little bit additional color, that would be great. Mick and also, if I'll throw my follow-up question also together in terms of inventory levels, how should we think about inventory levels on masks, accessories across the pond. Is there anything out of the normal? Or how would you characterize it? Thank you for taking my questions.
Michael Farrell: Great. Well, I'll take the first question around pricing impact. And then Brett, you'll take the sneaky second question there around -- sneaky, I mean, by getting it in upfront, Suraj, not the question itself, on inventory levels, particularly with masking accessories. And we saw the total inventory come down, but I think it's specifically Brett on masks and accessories. So firstly, on pricing impact, look, Suraj, you and all the sell side, you guys do your investigations and you look and talk to our customers, particularly in the U.S. and ask about pricing. You know that as a company, you've followed us over the last few fiscal years, we did see cost of components go up with inflation with shipping costs that have gone -- we've had increased cost of goods sold that ResMed has had to deal with, and we've shared some of that, not all of it. We've shared some of that with our customers with some increase in pricing. Often associated directly with innovation, right? The AirSense 11 was higher priced than the AirSense 10, but it's small, it's quiter. It's more comfortable. It's more connected. It has 2-way comps. It has over-the-year upgrades. It has all these advances. And so, it has a high price point. Similarly, with new mask inventions, the F40 is out there. It's a great mask. We don't need a price discount on something that is that much better than the competition. It's the smallest full-face mask, the smallest oral nasal mask in the history, a 35-year history of ResMed. So that -- those will be at price premiums. And so don't break out the exact breakdown on devices or masks of pricing or volume. But I can tell you, the vast majority of our growth was all on volumes. It's all about getting more of the one billion-plus patients with a sleep apnea, the half billion patients with insomnia and half billion with COPD into the system, so they can get better fleet and better breathing. So we focus primarily on that screening diagnosis treatment, get the volume in, and then ASP is a component in that where we have increased costs. Look, frankly, I hope inflation comes down and costs come down, and we can share some savings with our customers because they have a tough time with reimbursement often not going up. At least the U.S. Medicare went up at the start of this year, in line with an inflation adjustment, but not all insurance companies around the world do that. And so, our job is to get more patients in to make sure the channel is profitable so that we can have more money to invest in getting awareness out to all the patients who need our help. That's my answer to the first half. Brett, over to you to talk about inventory and masks and accessories, particularly.
Brett Sandercock : Yes. Thanks, Mick. Yes, on inventory, we've brought the inventory levels down over the last 12 months or so. I think down to reasonably appropriate levels where we are seeing at the moment. And then inventory likely to grow more in line with revenue as we go forward. So, we feel we are in reasonable shape there. In terms of masks can accessories around that, we don't think of that too much differently. There's nothing particularly specific about it. We manage those inventory levels as we do with devices and components and so on. So, nothing particularly to call out there other than I think we've got -- we're more comfortable with inventory levels that we're at now, and we will work, for example, 12 months ago. So, I think we're in pretty good shape on inventory.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the question. And I'm going to apologize because it's a series of three questions, but I'm going to say pick and choose whatever you want to answer. I promise they're all connected. And it's really -- Mike, you talked about wanting to be a sleep concierge service in one of your earlier question answers. And so, the question is, one, First, is the sleep concierge service something that you will give away as a service? I assume you will, but maybe there's some ability to monetize that. And then two, how many patients do you think that those digital technologies that you referenced, how many patients could they bring into the market over what time period? Is it millions already what's your success rate in getting those patients connected to you and ultimately, on a CPAP today versus what they're -- where they're getting lost. And third, again, I apologize for the multiquestion here. But ultimately, this all kind of brings this idea of the funnel together and you guys delivered double-digit growth this quarter, I guess, is that one way to continue that as a trend and whether you want to give it numerically or not. But how do you get that over time on a longer-term basis? Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Margaret, it's a great set of questions. And it really is one question, right? It's really about that demand generation and how we can as a company best leverage what is, frankly, once in a generation in the pharmaceutical cycle. And I think maybe once in a generation on the wearable cycle from consumer tech of a bolus of patients over the coming one, three, five, 10 years. So, look, yes, we want -- we aspire to be this digital health concierge and digital health concierge specifically for sleeping and breathing. Look, I mean, obviously, when we're providing technology, if we're providing a service that is a service that's out there in the health care field, we're going to be charging for it. But in the context of helping people find access to information, ResMed has the world's leading database with 19 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. We have more knowledge than anyone on the planet. I wouldn't call it a data lake, but I'd call it a data well, it's a bunch of deep, deep information about the field of sleep and breathing and about patients how they get to sleep, how they breath all night, and how they wake up and have mask leak and/or apneas and/or issues. And so with that, we want to bring that information and bring it to the world. For instance, we don't charge patients for myAir. Patients get access because we believe they paid their insurance. They -- in markets that are cash pay, they paid for that product with their own cash. So I believe they have the right to access their own data on their myAir app. So if they sign up, there's 8.3 million patients, they get myAir for free. So in a similar context, I would want patients to be able to find access to a pathway on a sort of freemium basis. If there's advanced analytics and advanced information we're doing that does. AI isn't free, a lot of engineers to write it and a lot of energy consumed in the algorithms as they run. We probably will charge for some of those advanced information similar to what we do with AirView with our providers and physicians. So sleep health concierge, there will be freemium basis and will be out there. There probably will be some pay -- for the really advanced folks. But the primary goal is to help the billion people find their path to treatment. Now to your specific questions about quantifying how many patients in the channel, how many extra have we got from consumer tech, from big pharma versus from standard referrals. We do have some analytics and measurement on that. They're internal and they're not for sort of public consumption. If I say them here on the call, they become public for them. But I can tell you we are productively paranoid about analyzing this channel. The flow of patients in where they come from and how they come from, what we can do to drive more patients in from each element of that. how we can get an ROI of either direct consumer advertising or social media-driven advertising and really track the return on that. So watch this space, a lot of investment from ResMed. It is our brand promise to help people get better sleep, better breathing and better care at home. And we're the world leader. It's our duty to do so. So I do believe, to answer the sort of third part of your question, bringing the funnel together, it is all about that. We achieved incredible growth, double-digit growth, as you said, across the business, north of 6% in devices, north of 15% in masks and incredible growth in our respiratory care -- sorry, residential care services and software at 10%. So really proud of the team. Our goal to keep doing it and keep doing it quarter in, quarter out, and the team is on it. So thanks for your question, Margaret.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks, Mike. Congrats on the quarter here, let me just stay on the theme high level. If you think about the debate on GLP-1, on the one hand, we still have a low diagnostic rate just for sleep apnea overall. I think it stands at 20% or so based on the last Wisconsin sleep study. So when you think about Lilly coming in here, potentially doing DTC. Where do you think the diagnostic rate can go, so that would be a huge tailwind. And then on the flip side, you think about the continuum. We have dental devices CPAP therapy, auto, CPAP, of course, in their sleep metrics on AirView, et cetera. And then we also have hypoglossal nerve stimulation. When we add in the GLP-1, how do you think the decision-making process will shake out over time? Thanks again.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Anthony. It's a broad one. It allows me to talk about diagnostics rates, but also the different sort of, as you said, continuum of care of the therapies for obstructive sleep apnea or sleep apnea in general. So yes, the Wisconsin Cohort, The Sleep Heart Health Study is a fantastic multi-decade study and really Terry Young and her colleagues have done incredibly well to have such a broad study across the field. It does talk about the United States having diagnostic rates in that 15% to 20% rate. But it is a U.S.-based study in the Sleep Heart Health Study. It's out of Wisconsin, it's U.S. based. It doesn't talk about Europe. And in Western Europe, the diagnostic rate is well south of 10% across Europe. And in Asia Pacific, MEA and rest of world and Latin America, we're less than 5% penetrated into this. And if you just look at the macro of it, right, we've got -- and we brag about it. We're so proud of having 28 million patients in our ecosystem. That's out of one billion patients worldwide. So that's 2.8% of patients in our ecosystem. And we're the world leader. We're the world leader in digital health, not just for respiratory medicine, but across the board with 19 billion nights of data. So globally, this is a single-digit penetration market. And so, I welcome firstly, patients need treatment. I welcome all alternative therapies. We're investing in all alternative therapies. We invest in CPAP, APAP, bilevel, obviously, world leader in that. We're investing in dental therapy. We're the world leader in naval 3D printed devices for Western Europe and Northern Europe, #1 in three different dental devices in those regions. And we're investing in pharma with our at need investment and we're investing in hypoglycem with our XR investment. So we want to take care of every single patient. But the goal when you talk about the continuum of care, if you're a physician, payer provider and you're looking at the holistic system, you want lowest cost most efficacious, least invasive, most reversible and the most used in terms of data of lowering death rates 39% -- sorry, 29% reduction in mortality rates that we've seen PAP across our Alaska study. So our goal is, yes, get that patient in the sleep health concierge channel, get them to the best therapy, which is start with CPAP, as you said, probably upgrade sometimes to APAP, sometimes bilevel. If you fail all of those and maybe 10% of the patients, we just can't get there, 10% plus, we then will help them find a path to dental therapy, which is the next most efficacious therapy. Then after that, based on SIM out study, probably pharma comes a little bit ahead of hypoglossal nerve stim in efficacy, right? They're talking 60% AHI reduction versus just north of 50% for some of the surgical ones. So probably third-line therapy is going to be either GLP-1 or an apnemed-type product. And I think that all of the above are great, and we're investing in all of the above. And look, if you can't tolerate the see the dental and you won't take a pill, you probably do need to have that implant because some treatments better than no treatment. And we know that if you're treated for the suffocation, you're going to have lower incidences of heart attack, stroke, all-cause mortality and you're going to be less costly to the health care system. We have dose response relationship data showing for every hour on positive airway pressure therapy. We see 7% to 8% reduction in emergency room costs. So our goal is to continue and be part of this ecosystem and help patients find their pathway to therapy. We are seeing more patients coming from this. I hope it does increase that diagnostic percentage because it's our obligation as an industry to do so. Thanks for the question, Anthony.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Yeah, good morning, Mick, Brett and Amy. Mick, can I just get you to give some commentary around the SURMOUNT-OSA write-up in the New England Journal and particularly some of those secondary endpoints as it relates to the reduction in AHI in that no disease effectively of mild disease. You mentioned the data as it relates to resupply. I was wondering if you have any data that looks at or tracks people who are giving a script for GLP-1 and CPAPs as to how many people have actually been able to come off CPAP at the end of either 12 months or 24 months? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Saul, thanks for the question. And look, we're looking at the real-world evidence every single way that we can. And yes, certainly, the SURMOUNT-OSA data had a pretty extraordinary trial, right, where they had the patients with the sleep coach, a nutrition coach, an exercise coach, they were calling them and interacting with them every day. So even people in the placebo arm had incredible reductions in weight and some really big reductions in HI in the placebo one, where they got no pharmaceutical medication, whatsoever, either saline or nothing. And so look, I think that under that circumstance, there's roughly 600 patients, plus or minus. They have some extraordinary results. But even in all those circumstances, they still weren't as good as dental devices and certainly nowhere near the 95% reduction in HI that any doctor would want with positive airway pressure therapy. But look, look, it certainly was larger than many people thought in the HR reduction. So, I think it's great. I think it means that those two companies that are investing in this are going to go through, getting the indication for use, and then they're going to be out there doing DTC advertising, which in the U.S, you can do a late-night television, and they'll be out there. They'll find some catchy tune and it'll will be out there driving patients into the funnel, and I think it will be good for all of us in the therapeutic side. We're definitely looking at the churn rates and CPAP quitters, APAP quitters, bilevel quitters and really looking in detail at it. I can tell you, in aggregate, we've seen no change on the data. And as you know, the latest generation GLP-1s, some of them have been out there one year, three years, four years plus these latest gen, and we're not seeing any increase in that. We're looking at it real-world data, and we're analyzing left, right and center, but we're not seeing an increase in quitters rates. If anything, we're seeing more motivated patients come in and holding on more. The combination therapy, which is what the primary investigators in this talk about, which is CPAP plus drug therapy as in I'm managing my weight and my suffocation are really there. And the vast majority of patients have incredible residual apnea at levels that would be treated by any primary care physician in the planet even under the very controlled circumstances of this trial, let alone what's going to actually happen in the real world. So we're watching it. We have a really strong focus on it. We've got 811,000 patients in our study. and we'll continue to publish data on it. And as we get more and more, we'll go even more to publish an American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society and get in the Blue Journal and all the big journals to have this down there in the clinical literature as well as the subjects that we're looking at in our analysis. Thanks for the question, Saul.
Operator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunities in front of us, as you heard from all these questions, huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health system, and this will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all the ResMedians, who listen to this call around the world. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening and your questions. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed's Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Kevin, you may now close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-04-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello. And welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2024 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to ResMed’s third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Our earnings press release and presentation are both available online now. During today’s call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today’s earnings press release to reconcile the non-GAAP measures with the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I’d like to now turn the call over to ResMed’s Chairman and CEO, Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect another strong period of execution across our entire business, resulting in solid topline growth and strong double-digit bottomline growth. Our results were driven by ongoing new patient demand for our devices across global markets, high single-digit growth in our Software-as-a-Service business and double-digit global growth in our Masks and Accessories business. This is exceptional performance given that we are annualizing a very strong quarter of growth in the prior year. The recent launch of our ResMed 2030 operating model and our steady focus on driving increased operating leverage are delivering excellent bottomline results and keeping us on a clear trajectory of ongoing profitable growth. Over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from sleep apnea, what I call sleep suffocation, insomnia or respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic that ResMed is uniquely positioned to address. We believe that healthcare should be delivered at the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. In the optimal case, that’s in a person’s own home. We are the global strategic leader in providing therapies for this epidemic, as well as market-leading enterprise software for Residential Care, including home medical equipment, home nursing and beyond. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 18 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 24.5 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices that have been sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear leader in sleep apnea, a market of over 1 billion people globally. Our end markets remain significantly underpenetrated. We believe the latest advances in big consumer tech and Big Pharma can potentially bring incredible numbers of new patients into the healthcare system where ResMed is uniquely positioned to provide ongoing care at home. We have a myriad of opportunities to add value, to reduce friction, to improve interoperability, to lower costs and to improve patient outcomes. We’re the global strategic leader with software supporting hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world beyond the hospital system. Many more people can benefit from our products and solutions and we’re laser-focused on growing the market to help people get on the therapy they need and on a pathway to better sleep, better health and better long-term care. Sales of our devices, including the category-leading AirSense platforms, grew 5% year-over-year globally. Excluding the one-time COVID-related ventilator sales in the third quarter of last year, global devices grew about 300 basis points higher than that, so right around 8% global devices growth. We are maintaining supply of two of the two market-leading 100% cloud-connectable platforms, the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11. We’re working to increase the global availability of the AirSense 11 platform by securing market-by-market regulatory clearances. We are following a similar path with our recently launched AirCurve 11 Bilevel and non-invasive ventilator platform as we continue its launch in the U.S. and beyond in the period ahead. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed Mask portfolio. Our Masks and Accessories business achieved 10% growth year-over-year, expanding at or above the market in a competitive category globally. During the quarter, we introduced our latest mask innovation into the U.S. market called the AirFit F40. The F40 features a proprietary new technology that we call AdaptiSeal. It is a silicone cushion designed to create and maintain a better facial seal even when the person is moving frequently during sleep. It leverages a fully flexible frame technology to cope with such frequent nocturnal movement. Physicians, respiratory therapists and patients love the F40 for its comfort, its fit and its ease of use. It is the smallest full-face mask on the market from ResMed. Patients are voting with their wallets and respiratory therapists and physicians are voting with their recommendations and their prescriptions. We look forward to ongoing success in the U.S. and to swiftly bring the F40 to other global markets very soon. Mask and Accessory ReSupply programs are an important element of our offering, as we serve the ongoing therapy needs of patients globally. ResMed’s clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive ReSupply programs directly for their patients. In our cash pay markets, we’ve established a number of subscription programs that have been adopted by consumers. Research shows that ReSupply programs lead to better patient adherence and better long-term clinical outcomes for the patient and their caregivers. In the U.S., our ReSupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, myAir for patients and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. We will continue to develop, launch and scale these technologies, as well as direct subscription programs to help people take control of their own health. Regularly refreshing ongoing therapy needs including masks, tubing, humidifiers and other accessories. Let’s now turn to a discussion of our top three global strategic priorities here at ResMed. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design, develop and deliver market-leading medtech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 plus countries worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world’s best software solutions for Residential Care. As a global market leader in these significantly underpenetrated markets, our most significant opportunity is actually to expand and grow the market itself through awareness, diagnosis and pathways to treatment. We aspire to be the digital health concierge for each person as they pursue their personal journey to better sleep, better breathing and better care where they live. We are ramping up our demand generation initiatives to do just that. The ResMed 2030 operating model changes that we made recently position us for success as a product-led, customer-centric, brand-enhanced leader in health tech. We’re raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for their sleep health and their breathing health across the globe. We are leveraging traditional market channels and investing in cost-effective, social media-driven demand generation campaigns. The goal is to help consumers concerned about their sleep and breathing find their way into appropriate screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. As we continue on our journey to create this digital health concierge for individuals, we are tracking progress with hard metrics. We are looking at new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, including AirView, which now contains more than 27 million patient records. We’re also tracking new starts in myAir, our consumer patient engagement app, where people choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. myAir now includes a population of 7.8 million users. We will drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help for their sleep suffocation into the health care system. We believe two global megatrends will further support our ongoing growth. Awareness driven by consumer tech, specifically sleep tracking wearables like the Samsung Galaxy Watch which has a de novo FDA clearance to screen for sleep apnea. We expect similar capabilities from other wearables from Big Tech including the Apple Watch and Google’s Fitbit. In addition, we believe that the population of patients, the other megatrend, the population of patients coming from Big Pharma as they focus on obesity and related impacts on health, including sleep health, will bring an incredible volume of patients into the healthcare system and the patients will have clinically significant sleep apnea that is best addressed by our therapies post these other therapies. We love this attention from big consumer tech on the field of sleep wellness tracking and we believe that many of these wearable technologies will help consumers find out if they have issues with breathing during sleep or maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia or both, a new disease state that has been called by the physicians COMISA. Ultimately, we believe that this will lead to increased patient awareness and sustainable long-term growth for ResMed. Our goal is to educate people as they move from sleep wellness tracking with these wearables to what I call sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness to a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ultimately ongoing management of their sleep health and breathing health. We believe that here at ResMed we are uniquely positioned to help. Big Pharma is squarely focused on GLP-1 medications right now. For many people dealing with their obesity, their healthcare goals are focused on losing weight while improving their diet, exercise and their sleep routines. We believe that increased utilization of GLP-1s to treat obesity will bring many new people into the healthcare funnel, activating them to see their primary care physicians as they strive for weight loss and other medical health. We believe this will open these patients up to knowledge of their other chronic diseases from their primary care physicians, including awareness of chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, ultimately driving new patients into diagnosis and treatment pathways that may not have previously been considered or been treated for those patients. So we believe this will drive not just more patients into our channel, but also more motivated patients into our channel. ResMed has been tracking the impact of GLP-1s through a de-identified patient analysis using an overlap of our data and third-party claims data. With another quarter of data analyzed, we are now up to an incredible N equals 660,000 subjects in our analysis. The bottomline is that the data show that GLP-1s are having a positive impact on patients seeking and adhering to positive airway pressure therapy. The latest numbers are an improvement from what we presented previously. For patients prescribed a GLP-1 medication, the latest data show a 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy over those not taking the drug. As we follow these patients longitudinally, the ReSupply rate at T equals 12 months is 310 basis points higher. That’s 3.1 absolute basis percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. And then at T equals 24 months, the ReSupply rate is 500 basis points. So 5.0 absolute percentage points higher for patients who have a GLP-1 prescription. These data show clearly that these new GLP-1 pharmaceutical class is actually a tailwind for our ResMed business, bringing more patients and more motivated patients into the healthcare system. We’ve included the full analysis of these data in our investor deck and I encourage you to review the data there. It’s very positive information and very thorough and detailed work by our healthcare economics and outcomes research, as well as our digital health analytics teams here at ResMed. Existing clinical studies show many factors impact sleep apnea epidemiology, including craniofacial anatomy, age of the subject, gender and weight. With over 1 billion people on the planet with sleep apnea right now, 80% plus of them are undiagnosed in our biggest market, the United States and over 90% of patients are undiagnosed globally. There remains an incredible opportunity to help people sleep and breathe better through positive airway pressure therapy, the universally recognized gold standard for treating sleep apnea. We look forward to more patients entering the healthcare system for care and more motivated patients who can get on our therapy faster and stay on it longer. In terms of best-in-class treatments for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published evidence demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients’ adherent to our positive airway pressure technology by combining our market-leading device platforms, our market-leading masks, with our digital health solutions. Even with this best-in-class global tech, just over 10% of patients still need alternative therapies, and we have a very high volume of patients coming through these days. We’re investing in alternative therapies and we’re working to help patients who just can’t adhere to positive airway pressure therapy despite the latest technology to find their path to second-line therapies, such as dental devices, where ResMed has the market-leading 3D printed dental device on the planet for sleep apnea in Western Europe and Northern Europe. That’s called Narval. In addition, we have investments in third-line therapies, including pharmaceutical options. We’re an investor in Apnimed, and we’re also an investor in hypoglossal nerve-stimulation technology through our investment in a company called Nyxoah. ResMed is about sleep health, it’s about breathing health and it’s about delivering the best care right where you live. We make sure the person finds the path to the highest efficacy, lowest cost, most comfortable therapy that’s best for them. Let’s pivot now to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging our 18 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and our 24.5 100% cloud-connectable devices that are out there in our ecosystem across 140 countries. We are investing in a portfolio of artificial intelligence-driven capabilities, as well as customer-facing AI products in our ecosystem. We continue to roll out these products in our AirView ecosystem, such as Compliance Coach, that I talked about last quarter, that’s rolling out in the United States. We’re also progressing well with our generative AI capabilities to help patients along their journey, really people before they’re patients and then they become people seeking sleep health and breathing health solutions, and then on their journey they become patients. And we’re rolling out that gen AI capability in the Asia-Pac region for now and we’ll look to scale that as we move forward. We’ll continue to share progress on this front, as this revolutionary tech is developed and scaled across our business and many of medtech and health tech peers are doing the same and our ecosystem will move forward. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms and our life-support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high-flow therapy that we call HFT to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at home at a cost-effective rate. This is a long-term opportunity focused on generating evidence, developing pathways and driving new reimbursement options. We are focused on driving adoption of these technologies for treatment at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD, as well as neuromuscular diseases, continues to increase, and we have low-cost, high-efficacy and high-tech treatments in HFT and beyond to address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business in the field of Residential Care, we have another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 8%. We plan to maintain high single-digit growth in the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and we plan to accelerate to double-digit growth for our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We are seeing ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our core home medical equipment channel and its ReSupply capabilities. We are driving good growth across both our Residential Care SaaS and our core sleep health and breathing health businesses while serving many hundreds of thousands of patients. Our Residential Care SaaS business is integral to ResMed’s growth portfolio and we’re excited to have created a global business that will achieve double-digit growth on an organic basis throughout fiscal year 2025. We continue to drive OpEx leverage by managing our capabilities for cloud compute, cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy and R&D across our go-to-market brands that include Brightree, MatrixCare, and MEDIFOX DAN. And those synergies go not just across the SaaS businesses, but also directly into our core sleep health and breathing health business. And beyond this infrastructure leverage, our Residential Care SaaS business drives platform development synergies and customer engagement facilities and capabilities that are synergies as well, and these highly complement the market-leading medtech and software solutions capability that’s there right in our core sleep health and breathing health business ecosystem, including products like AirView and myAir and beyond. We are transforming Respiratory Medicine and Residential Care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We’re focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability all the way to the bottomline, and we made very good progress on that this quarter. The team delivered non-GAAP operating income up 23% and non-GAAP net income up 27%. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected, and most intelligent medtech solutions. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 174 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient right where they live. We’ve helped each person sleep better, breathe better and live higher quality lives with best-in-class healthcare. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I’ll hand over the call to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we’ll open up to Q&A with the entire team between Sydney and San Diego. Over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I’ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and let’s note that all comparisons out of the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms were applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.2 billion, a 7% headline increase and a 7% increase in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects positive and consistent contributions across our product and ReSupply portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenue during the March quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3%. Globally, device sales increased by 5%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, supported by solid ongoing new patient diagnosis, while masks and other sales increased by 12%, reflecting growth in both ReSupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 1% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth moderated due to incremental revenue in the prior year quarter of approximately $15 million from COVID-related demand. Excluding the COVID-related sales, device revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Masks and other sales increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter, underpinned by growth from MEDIFOX DAN and continued strong performance from our HME Vertical. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 58.5% in the March quarter. The increase was driven by reductions in freight expense, manufacturing cost improvements, favorable product mix and an increase in device average selling prices. Sequential gross margin improved by 160 basis points. We continue to monitor potential headwinds that could arise from the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea have increased freight costs and shipping lead times. We estimate this will negatively impact our Q4 gross margin by around 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 1%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.2%, compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflect savings and ongoing cost discipline following restructuring actions undertaken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4%, compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 23%, underpinned by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and modest growth in our operating expenses. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $11 million. Given our lower debt levels, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20.3%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 27% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $402 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and improvement in our working capital position. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $43 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $238 million. On March 31 we had $1 billion in gross debt and $676, sorry, $769 million in net debt. During the quarter we reduced our debt by $220 million. On March 31 we had approximately $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. During the quarter we purchased 261,000 shares under our previously authorized share buyback program for consideration of $50 million. We plan to continue to purchase shares for the value of approximately $50 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward we plan to continue to reinvest in gross through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tucking acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. Thanks Mick. Kevin, let’s go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Thanks very much and good morning. Look, I just wanted to ask about that gross margin predictably. That recovery is pretty sharp whereas I think you had perhaps talked to a more modest gross margin recovery in the second half. So I just wanted to ask how sustainable that recovery is into fourth quarter and into 2025?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks Dan. It’s a good question and obviously as we talked about on the call a quarter ago and two quarters ago we’ve got long-term programs and short-term programs that are moving very carefully to move our gross margin up. Some -- very long-term as we walk through the launch of our AirSense 11 platform which is at a better cost point, a better price point. Launch of our new masks, the F40 last quarter and these have effects that go over long-term. Some of the faster impacts we’re able to do is working through the inventory that were high freight costs from the semiconductor crisis and the supply chain crisis from six months, nine months, 12 months, 18 months ago that are flowing through our system. So look, I’m not upset when the team overperforms my expectations as they did here. As Brett said in Q4 we’ll see some moderation of that due to Red Sea impacts of a couple of tens of basis points, sort of 30 basis points, 40 basis points. Brett can give more detail on that. But look Dan, I’m very, what I’m excited about...
Operator: Please stand by. We appear to be having technical difficulties. Please stand by.
Mick Farrell: He cannot. Brett says he can’t hear us.
Operator: Please proceed.
Brett Sandercock: Okay.
Operator: Please proceed.
Brett Sandercock: Can you hear me now, Kevin?
Operator: We can now. Please proceed. We did lose your audio briefly. We do apologies. Please proceed.
Mick Farrell: Okay. Great. Well I’ll hand over to Brett to answer the question on gross margin and then I’ll follow up. I don’t know where I got cut off there. Brett, you do. Over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I’m not sure where that landed, but, yeah, in terms of gross margin, it is hard to predict given the movements in, we have product mix, geographic mix, timing of cost improvements, FX, freight costs. So it’s all into the mix that we had pretty strong improvement through freight expense, through manufacturing efficiencies and so on coming through and that helped a lot. Stable component costs also means that’s no longer a headwind there. So I think that’s all reflected in the gross margin improvement. And as Mick said, in the short-term, there is some Red Sea freight cost impacts that will come through in Q4 but our goal remains to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live.
Laura Sutcliffe: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just sticking with gross margin, could you possibly give us an indication of how much of that 240-basis-point improvement in core gross margin was freighting and how much was manufacturing? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Brett, you can answer that.
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. I mean, that -- of that year-on-year, the 240 basis points, the biggest contributors were the freight cost reduction and also the manufacturing cost improvements were the biggest drivers there. We saw some benefit or some favorable product mix playing out there and a little bit in terms of ASP increases, but by far the most significant two, which were significantly contributed in their own right, were the freight expense reduction and the manufacturing cost improvements.
Laura Sutcliffe: Are you able to tell us sort of how it falls between freighting and manufacturing cost improvement?
Brett Sandercock: I would say -- I wouldn’t get drawn into specifics of each of the components, but I would say, both of those are material in their own right of contributing to that 240 basis points.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.
Craig Wong-Pan: Thank you. I just wanted to touch on the rest of world markets to see whether you’re seeing much impact from business there and if any benefit was coming through from the backlog of activity with home care companies?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Craig. And yeah, no, we really didn’t see, I mean, look, we’ve got many competitors out there in Europe, Asia, rest of the world, including the one you mentioned, and it’s a full playing field. It has been the whole time on masks, so there’s no change to anyone coming back or leaving on the mask side. On the device side, no huge impacts. We were comping a very large device number, Europe, Asia, rest of the world, this quarter last year, we had a 36% growth that we’re comping. And so we had good growth there on a 36% comp at plus 1%. And if you take out from last year, a large ventilation provision in China, this time a year ago, China had a big COVID impact on ventilator purchase. If you take that out, the year-on-year growth would have been 8% in Europe, Asia, rest of world devices. So up 700 basis points. So look, the way I look at it is, we’re maintaining or growing share in all of our markets on the device side. We’re the market leader with the AirSense 11 platform. And we’ve got the second best platform in the world with the AirSense 10 platform against all competitors and so really strong there. So no major impacts from restocking and no major impacts from competitive activity and I think we had a very, very strong performance from the team in terms of their ability to ramp up the supply over the last period and get it all out there. And we’re not -- no customer is not being able to fulfill an order. If they have an order for devices, we fill it up as much as we can with AirSense 11s and then we fill up the remainder with AirSense 10s and we’re able to take care of those customer needs and so really good quarter of execution by our supply chain teams, as well as our delivery teams and our commercial teams out there.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I just want to touch on new patient starts, maybe focusing on the U.S. if we can. Obviously, COVID had the impact of closing sleep labs and then followed on by some supply constraints around devices. Can you just give us a bit of a sense as to how you’re seeing new patient starts at the moment versus a trend, perhaps, and then also just touching on trends around home sleep testing versus PSG and how that might be impacting people coming to the system?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Two great components to the same question there, David. In terms of new patient starts, as you saw in U.S., Canada, Latin America, we achieved pretty strong growth of 7% of devices in the quarter and that was on a comp, this time last year of 49%. So what I’d say is, and this is what we say, is that the market is sort of, if ResMed doesn’t do enough around demand gen, the market will grow at mid-single digits on devices and high-single digits on masks. Obviously, we beat that this quarter with our device growth in the U.S, Canada, Latin America at 7%. So new patient starts are strong. There is some repat there, but it’s a minority, and I can tell you that new patient flow into our channel has been steady. And we said this last quarter that we’re starting to get back to that steady flow of patients. We’ve sort of gone through the perturbations of the COVID dip, the COVID rebound, the supply chain dip, the supply chain rebound, and now we’re at steady state. So seeing really good flow of patients into the U.S. As I said on the prepared remarks, we are seeing these patients who come in on the GLP-1s and it’s only N equals 660,000 patients that we’re looking at, but that’s quite a big cohort. And as we look at those patients, their propensity to start being 10.5% above people without a prescription for that drug, I actually think we’re seeing a really good flow that I think will be a long-term, I think, there’s a long period of time, the S-curve of penetration of these GLP-1s, and I think, that’s going to be a long cohort of patients coming into the channel. So really good on new patient starts. And in terms of ReSupply, yeah, look, we’ve got really good capabilities in the U.S., particularly with Brightree and Snap technologies and Brightree ReSupply, and our subscription models and our cash pay markets around the world. But there’s a lot more runway left. There’s many patients who aren’t yet on a subscription program and cash pay markets, and there’s many patients who aren’t yet on appropriate resupply in our large and developed markets. So I would say new patient flow in is very solid. ReSupply, whether it’s REPAP or reestablishing masks and accessories, is good, but a lot of runway left, a lot of runway left on both in terms of demand gen and resupply.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks, everyone, and congrats on a strong quarter here. Maybe, Mick, just staying on the GLP-1 topic, maybe just the House views on the SURMOUNT-OSA headline readout and as we look to the ADA meeting in June there, anything that you’re really paying attention to and honing in on when we get the final data readout, are there specific secondary endpoints or sub-analyses that we should be focused in on? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And yeah, certainly we saw the headline results from that SURMOUNT-OSA trial, and look, since they had, just to be really clear, their study had that at least seven-day washout at the end on the study that had patients that had been using CPAP. So with that seven-day to nine-day washout period at the end, this was really a trial laser-focused on comparing their drug to placebo. And what it showed is somewhere in that sort of 59% to 63% reduction of AHI, and if you do the math on it and you look at the sort of average AHI coming in of around 50%, the average AHI coming out is sort of in the low 20%s. So patients were, at the end of the study, on average, were suffocating every 3 minutes of sleep after treatment for this drug, right? And so AHI of 20% or more, moderate plus sleep apnea, these patients would be treated by any sleep physician on the planet and really require positive airway pressure treatment. So I think that’s the most important thing to say right up front. And so as we look at the readout that’ll come in June when they release the full analysis here and the primary investigators get up and we see all the sub-analysis data, what will be interesting is to look at, because the combination therapy of CPAP plus CAPAP plus these GLP-1s had a slightly higher efficacy, if you like, it had a higher reduction in AHI. I’ll be interested to look on the secondary outcomes, were there more blood pressure reductions and other cardiovascular improvements, heart remodeling and things like that happen over time and the washout period might have diluted that a little bit, it’ll depend on where they took them. But those would be the things that I’d be interested in on this study. As we see it, we’re seeing new patients come in on this and not just anecdotally from the letters I get from patients saying, I’ve been using a GLP-1 and now I’m using a PAP, this combination therapy is great, I’m taking care of my diet, my exercise and my sleep. But we’re seeing real world evidence, real world data that we’re presenting, N equals 660,000 patients and these patients start CPAP more, they adhere more. I mean, the fact that at 12 months ReSupply goes up 3.1%, 310 basis points. The fact that ReSupply at 24 months goes up 500 basis points, 5 absolute percentage points higher, means that this is not only more patients into the funnel from this drug and not just this particular drug from this particular company, but this class of drugs. We included tirzepatide and semaglutide in our analysis and others. All new gen, vast majority new gen tech. And I can tell you, we are going to do our own social media driven demand gen, but the fact that Big Tech with the Samsung Watch, the Apple Watch and Google’s Fitbit are going to be bringing patients in and Big Pharma, and this is trillions of dollars of capital between these companies are going to be doing advertising to drive patients into the funnel. We think this is a net tailwind for our business. We’ve started to see it somewhat now at the very early stages and we think it’ll be there in the future. So that’s what we’ll be looking for from this study, Anthony.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?
Mick Farrell: Yes, I can, Suraj. Hopefully your phone and our phone are good throughout this question and answer.
Suraj Kalia: So forgive me if there is any background noise. Mick, first and foremost, congratulations on this quarter. Mick, specifically, and I -- forgive me for belaboring this, gross margins, a nice uptick in the quarter. Mick, if I recall correctly, a couple of quarters ago, gross margins were soft and one of the reasons cited was a higher U.S. contribution, which intrinsically has lower margins than OUS. This quarter also, U.S. has ticked up nicely. Contribution has picked up. Maybe I’m missing a key aspect here. Can you help us reconcile those two? Thank you for taking my questions.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Suraj. I’ll have a go first and I’ll hand over to Brett for detail. But as I look at it from my perspective, there are a number of factors that were positives to have such a great gross margin number this quarter. The first one was that we had excellent work by our global supply chain teams to work on getting our cost of goods sold down, not just direct COGS but OCOGS as well. And so we worked through some of that high inventory -- high cost inventory stock moved through the system, and some of the reengineering work and revalidation and verification work we’ve done has been able to bring new product to market. We have a good flow between the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. But look, if you look at the growth from like 12 months ago and some of the issues, I mean, we had -- as I said earlier, we had 49% growth in our U.S., Canada, Latin America flow generators a year ago. That has a very big impact on margin as it’s, lower margin than our masks business and other businesses, certainly in our ventilation and software around the world. This quarter, we’re sort of back to a steady state where ResMed’s growing well. We’re growing at mid-to-high single digits in parts of our business and double digits in the masks and accessory side. And I think we’re just back to our core execution, something that ResMed’s done in our 35-year history is have operating excellence and operational excellence as a core competency. We were able to, after all those perturbations of COVID, supply chain, cost of inventory, we’re able to get back to what we do really well. So that’s what I’d say are the main factors for us achieving such great gross margin in the quarter. Brett, do you want to provide any further detail?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I mean, the only thing I would add is the geographic mix impacts tend to be pretty modest. You do see that, but for example, product mixes usually has much more impact than geographic mix. So it’s less of an impact on our margin either way from geographic mix. It’s there, but it’s not substantial.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor-Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor-Andrew: Hey. Good afternoon. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to maybe touch on the market demand drivers and demand gen that you referenced earlier on the call. My recollection can tell me if I’m wrong, but I think you guys have sporadically maybe invested in understanding market growth drivers and the Verily partnership is the one that kind of comes to mind on that. But as you think of demand gen, can you give us any data from those programs that might help inform the demand gen that you’re trying to create? Over what time period can these efforts make that impact on market growth? And again, key sources, is it local level, podcasts, newsletters, global level, celebrity, partnerships? Again, any details would be helpful. Thanks, guys.
Mick Farrell: Well, yeah. Thanks, Margaret. It’s a great question on how we’re going to learn from our many years of experience of getting patients in the funnel and taking it to the next level and scaling globally. As you know, we’ve had sort of direct to consumer campaigns in our cash paid countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and others around the world. One of the big changes we made in our 2030 operating model was to establish a Global Chief Product Officer, Global Chief Revenue Officer, but also a Global Chief Marketing Officer. And I think bringing that marketing function to be across the whole of the sleep health and breathing health business, and really across our whole ResMed business, is going to allow us to bring. Yeah, as you said, we did experiments in that joint venture where, by the way, we own all the intellectual property and capability of that joint venture, the assets and capability that we learned over those last many years in that JV. We’ve now taken that on board and we’ve said, okay, let’s not just do that in one metropolitan statistical area in the United States or within one country like Australia or another country like Singapore or Korea. Let’s look at ways we can scale that globally. So without signaling directly and exactly how, where, and when we’re going to do it, I can tell you we’ve got a global team looking at this, Margaret, and as we go throughout fiscal year 2025, we’re going to talk about, as they go public, this is the campaign. One thing that is different from what we did before is that I believe in what gets measured gets done and every single campaign we’re going to do is going to have hardcore metrics of sponsorship here, driven here and influence it there, this social media impact there. We’ll look at the ROI, and before it scales, we’re going to analyze that portfolio of primarily social media but other media-driven demand gen, and yes, it will be local, but it’ll also be national, and there’ll be global. The platforms will be global, the cultural impacts will be national, and then the impact will be local, and we’ll be measuring that direct ROI of that marketing spend. As you saw in the quarter, we were very efficient on SG&A this quarter. We will go back to our steady state on that, not growing at revenue, well below, but getting up to better growth and those investments will go in areas like this, in demand gen on SG&A, and of course, our core R&D growth will go back into AI and generative AI. I can tell you some of our work on generative AI in Asia-Pacific, helping a patient in that digital health concierge through the channel will be a big part of our demand gen as well, so a combination between R&D and SG&A there, but great question, Margaret, and we’ll update you as we move through fiscal year 2025 and beyond on our demand gen initiatives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Gretel Janu from E&P. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the gross margin and more just thinking about the gross margin trajectory into FY 2025, so how should we think about the quantum of improvement likely to be achieved into FY 2025, and where’s that additional step up going to come from now that you’ve kind of normalized a lot of the headwinds that we’ve seen in the last 12 months? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gretel. Brett, with this great performance from your finance and our global supply chain team, you’re getting all the questions this quarter, so over to you on projections for gross margin for FY 2025 to answer Gretel’s question.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. Gretel, I mean, there is -- yeah, there’s been quite a good increase year-on-year and freight and some manufacturing efficiencies, cost improvements there, obviously played a big part. We’re also not so much facing the headwinds of these component cost increases that we saw sort of six months to 12 months ago as well. But if you look forward, and it’s always hard to predict, as I mentioned earlier, there’s a lot that plays out on the gross margin, product mix, the timing of the cost improvements or the continuous improvement programs that we’re now running, and we’ve had an opportunity to do that. We’re really, really focused on supply and getting devices into the market. So now as that stabilizes, then that gives us an opportunity to work on cost improvement programs. So we’re focusing on that. So the goal, without being specific on targets, but certainly our goal is to improve gross margin over the course of FY 2025. And we’ve got, probably need to do that on a number of fronts, which is more around a continuous improvement or gradual improvement program now, I think, as we work through FY 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brett Fishbin from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Brett Fishbin: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Really appreciate some of the updates that you guys have provided on the data front. And I think what stood out to me a lot with the last couple of updates was the 10% plus type of increase that you’re seeing in PAP initiation rates for the GLP users. And then especially considering this isn’t really even reflecting some of the likely marketing activity from pharma. So curious, some of the factors that you think might be driving this correlation and then maybe looking ahead where this number could potentially go once we’re actually seeing patients that are prescribed with under an OSA indication and diagnosed with OSA?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Brett, it’s a really good question. It’s quite a complex one and I think it’ll play out over time. We’ve obviously got very strong quantitative data with the 660,000 subjects that we’re following in that analysis. But we get a lot of anecdotal information from folks, all the way from folks who are involved in the clinical research to frontline physicians through our network and we position this across 140 countries. These new medications are primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe right now. But as we watch, our hypothesis is that this new therapy is bringing people into the healthcare system who weren’t previously there. They weren’t choosing to go as frequently to their GP or their primary care physician. They are now seeing that PCP, that GP, and now they are getting treated for not only their obesity, but now other chronic diseases and we’ve seen this in other disease states from some of our peers here in medtech. But yeah, it’s quite extraordinary to have 10.5% higher propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy. There are not many other factors recently in terms of innovations from biotech and pharma that we’ve seen that could drive this level. And so it is early days as those drugs are penetrated in the U.S., Western Europe, and beyond. But we’re watching it very closely. I do think that these trillions of dollars worth of capital will bring lots of advertising and will bring lots of patients into the funnel. And then our job will be to help those patients to find the best path to the best therapy and the best therapy is positive airway pressure therapy and we’re seeing that in these early days. And yeah, I think as we move forward, we’ll learn more and we’ll keep updating as we go every quarter on our flow of patients that come into the funnel, how we’re seeing them and how we’re taking care of them through our own demand gen, through the demand gen that will be driven by this Big Pharma. And one that we didn’t get a question on, but I talked about on my prepared remarks there on Big Tech. I think the fact that there’ll be wearables on tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people’s wrists, looking at oximetry, looking at nocturnal sleep, looking at nocturnal breathing and helping patients find out if they’re not sleeping well, they’re not breathing well. I think that might actually be a higher tidal wave than the Big Pharma tidal wave. But we’ll watch that as we move forward, DAN. Thanks for the question, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Mike Matson: Yeah. So with the news that Coops [ph] is exiting the non-invasive ventilation market, is there an opportunity for ResMed to pick up some share in this category? And if so, can you maybe talk about how big you think that market is?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And the competitor you mentioned is leaving the U.S. market for life support ventilation. They will still, at this point, I think, claim to be coming back with CPAP, APAP and Bilevel. So that Bilevels are non-invasive ventilation. They reach an area of non-invasive ventilation. So we expect them back in that market. Look, I think there are opportunities in ventilation. Obviously, we saw through the COVID crisis, there was a very large volume of ventilators sold into the world in 2020, 2021, 2022. We talked about even just in 2023, we’re lapping a quarter where there were large sales a year ago into China of ventilators. And so I think, if you like, the supply of ventilators into the market is quite high. So there’s no huge sort of immediate opportunity by our competitor leaving life support ventilation in the U.S. But we are there to take care of our customers wherever they are, whatever country they’re in and whatever needs they have. For us, the more material growth is really around driving our CPAP, our APAP and our Bilevels with AirSense 11 and AirCurve 11. And the AirCurve 11, in terms of your question, non-invasive ventilation, has AirCurve S, AirCurve ST and AirCurve FTI. And at the highest level, it has an AirCurve ASV, which is the highest level of adaptive server ventilation. All these together form types of non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD or neuromuscular disease that leads to respiratory insufficiency. And ResMed has the best platform in the planet to treat them. We think it’s a huge opportunity. Many hundreds of millions of patients worldwide have COPD, neuromuscular disease and respiratory insufficiency and ResMed is there for them now and will be for them there in the future. It’s a long-term growth opportunity. It’s not a short-term pop. It’s a long-term growth opportunity for us to take care of these patients and help them sleep better, breathe better and our AirCurve platform is going to be fantastic to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, all. I might come back to the real-world data, Mick. Obviously, some good resupply improvements there, 300 basis points and 500 basis points. But is there anything you can share on the data or the trend for lower severity OSA patients, sort of the mild to moderate categories? And then also, secondly, on the data, whether we do this or a separate data set, what trend are you seeing in the percentage of patients who have ceased CPAP therapy as a result of weight loss drugs? Yeah. So it’s a good question, Lyanne, and there are sort of multiple parts to it. I’ll address it at a high level, which is to say, yeah, look, the real-world data is excellent. It’s the largest data set out there with 660,000 patients that have been prescribed a GLP-1 and are on positive airway pressure therapy and we’re really laser-focused on tracking that cohort very carefully. We can and will look to, in the future, slice and dice it by AHI, 5 to 15, 15 to 30, 30 plus. We’ll look to slice and dice it by age, by gender, by geography and others. A lot of that will be for our internal work so that we can best drive social media marketing and know which patients to go after. For instance, the public information out there is that women are using GLP-1s more than men, and they’re more adherent to the GLP-1s than men are. The rate that people quit the GLP-1 therapy is a lot higher in men than women. And so we’re tracking a lot of that information publicly and we will, over time, release it. We haven’t seen at all a correlation or information around people quitting PAP therapy because of a GLP-1. It just doesn’t compute in the data we’ve got. It’s the other way that it’s a huge tailwind for people coming in. Look, when we see -- as we say, we get 87% adherence. We’re very proud of that. For the 13% that don’t get there, we look at all the reasons why. Is it claustrophobia? Is it insomnia, where they have a psychological condition where they can’t fall asleep and then they blame it on the CPAP mask when it’s really a fact of a need to have treatment or their insomnia, as well as or in parallel to or even before their OSA. So we’re looking at all types of reasons for that. But, look, we’ll continue to update you and the rest of the world as we do the slice and dice by HI, by age, by gender, to find the best way to help patients find the best path to therapy. But right now, we’re seeing a huge trend of more patients coming in, more motivated patients, and our challenge is to keep up with that and make sure that we can scale and help them get on that great digital health journey.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.
Steve Wheen: Yeah. Thanks very much. I just had a question around the AirSense 11 and its availability and the pathway to it being kind of the platform that you 100% rely upon. If you could just give us an update as to how that looks for the remainder of this year and perhaps into 2025?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I’ll start out with this fact that we’re still selling the S9 product in China right now. And so, getting rid of it completely, right, the AirSense 10, will take a while because there’s great markets around the world where technology is useful for a long period of time. But I think what you’re talking to is the materiality of the AirSense 11 becoming the primary in global markets. I can tell you this, the AirSense 11 is already the primary platform in our biggest market in the U.S. It’s already well into the majority and growing quickly. And no customer who wants to order from ResMed can’t get AirSense 11s, as well as AirSense 10s. We do limit sometimes the AirSense 11s, because there’s so many customers from small, large regionals to statewide groups to nationals and we’ve got to balance the flow to make sure every person has a fair chance to get an AirSense 11 and then we cover the difference with the awesome AirSense 10s. So, we’re already over the majority in the U.S. As we look at other big markets around the world, you know, Germany, Japan, France, U.K., and beyond, the AirSense 11s are ramping very quickly and they’ll quickly get to the majority across those areas. As we look to more of the countries, hundreds more countries around the world than those top 20, our job is, as I said in the prep remarks, to get the regulatory clearances. Some of these countries require all separate paperwork and time and effort, and so we have to analyze how quickly we can do that and we are also working with authorities to see if we can get clearances that can be used across multiple regions. And so, Steve, we’re working very hard to get AirSense 11 in all countries and to the majority in all countries. I hope that answers your question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just another quick one for Brett. Brett, just looking at the inventory balance, it came down quite significantly into the third quarter. It’s the lowest inventory has been, I think, since 2022. Just wondering where you think inventory goes from here. Do you think you need to start to sort of rebuild as it relates to sort of product demand or do you think you can drive that dollar value down further? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Hi, Saul. I think, yeah, we had -- I mean, the team’s been working hard on that for a while now, so you’re starting to see the results there in the balance sheet and in the inventory, which is great. We’re getting pretty close to our targets on inventory, so I’d say it’s -- there could be modest reductions, there could be modest gains there. It’s more around making sure we’re balancing supply and demand now. So I’d say it’s pretty close to targets on kind of where we’re at now for the inventory.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Matthew Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Mike Toomey: Hi, guys. It’s Mike Toomey covering for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in here. Coming back to Philips, I know you said you’re maintaining or growing share in the markets where they’re returning, but are you seeing any significant pricing pressure or pricing discounts from them and any thoughts on when they might return to the U.S. market based on the consent decree? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mike. And no, look, what we’re seeing in the markets where that competitor’s returned is that they’re pricing for value and they’re trying to compete on value. And primarily as they come back from sort of zero percent share with new patients as they start in the market, they’re competing with the sort of Tier 2 and Tier 3 players, so a local player in Europe or a local player in Asia, and they’re not touching our share as the global market leader and global technology leader in this space. And the work that we’ve been able to do these number of years that they were out of each market is to really entrench ourselves because we’ve got the lowest cost, the highest efficacy, the best technology, and physicians love our digital data, patients love the engagement with myAir and the whole ecosystem creates that value. So we really have seen, you know, as they come in, they’re pricing for value and competing with Tier 2, Tier 3 players in those markets. As to when they’ll re-enter from zero percent new patient share into the U.S. market, I don’t know. You can do your own analysis on consent decrees. This one’s a very severe one. It has a lot of inspectors, sort of five times the normal number of inspectors. I think five versus one and a lot of constraints on that. I look forward to great competition. We’ve got good competition from the players there now. When they come back, they’ll have to compete with them first and us after that. But, no, look, we were winning and taking share from that competitor in 2019 all the way from 2010 to 2019. We’ll continue to do that and beat them whenever they come back to market. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. We’ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining this call, especially our shareholders. The opportunity in front of ResMed is huge and largely untapped. It’s an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system. This will benefit us as we help them sleep better, breathe better, and to live better and healthier and happier lives in over 140 countries. Thank you to 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom listened to this call and are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. With that, I’ll hand the call back to Amy and we can close it out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly. This concludes ResMed’s third quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, I’ll turn it back to you to officially close us out.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed’s third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-01-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ResMed Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Amy Wakeham. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of these are now available. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. This information is non-intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition to our discussion today, it will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now turn our call over to ResMed's CEO, Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our second quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong execution across our entire business, driving double-digit top and bottom line growth. These results are a testament to the incredible efforts of the global ResMed team. Our results were driven by double-digit global growth in both devices and our Software-as-a-Service business together with high single-digit global growth in our masks and accessories business, holding our leading market share amongst high comps from the same quarter a year ago. In terms of bottom line leverage, our reorganization efforts and efficiency efforts in the quarter have set us on a clear trajectory of profitable growth. Taking a step back, all 10,000 ResMedians are energized about the opportunities in front of us. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease or insomnia. These chronic conditions form a healthcare epidemic in which ResMed is uniquely positioned to help. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest security and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. Our end markets remain underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. We support hundreds of millions of people as they take control of their healthcare journey and navigate the complex healthcare world outside the hospital system. ResMed is the global leader in digital health solutions with over 17 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold into over 140 countries worldwide. We are the clear market leader in sleep apnea, a huge and growing market with over 1 billion people impacted globally. Our category-leading flow generator platforms grew 11% year-over-year. We have achieved and are maintaining supply of our two 100% connectable AirSense platforms, with unconstrained supply of the AirSense 10 platform globally. Every quarter, we continue to gain regulatory approvals to launch and to increase delivery volumes of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform on our pathway to support more and more patients worldwide. Our commercial teams are successfully demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. During the quarter, our masks and accessories business grew 9% year-over-year in a highly competitive market, maintaining good market share with all players in the field in this category globally. We are excited to have achieved regulatory and reimbursement approval for our latest and greatest mask innovation and we look forward to bringing this technology to market soon. I have personally worn this new mask and our test data show, not just n equals one from the CEO, that it is highly favored by physicians, respiratory therapists and especially the most important customer, our patients. In terms of maintaining our momentum of mask and accessory growth, our clinical and commercial teams continue to partner with physicians and providers to drive resupply programs directly with their patients. Peer-reviewed and published clinical evidence shows that using resupply programs leads to better patient adherence and to better patient outcomes. This is proving out in the real-world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the U.S. mask and accessories business, where resupply programs are powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians, Brightree for home care medical equipment providers and myAir for patients. Outside the U.S., we are focused on developing, launching and scaling our direct outreach and subscription programs, to help consumers take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their own mask, their own tubing, their own humidifier and other accessories. The importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene in the eyes of consumers has seen a permanent uptick since four years ago when the COVID-19 epidemic started. We are supporting our customers with digital solutions and services to meet their needs and to ensure they have clean and fresh equipment to best treat their sleep suffocation and improve their health. Before I review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to discuss recent actions we have taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long-term success. Last quarter, I discussed the steps we've taken to ensure that we can refocus and drive even more profitable growth. We stopped some projects that were not working out and we increased investment in areas that will be pivotal to our long-term success, including our digital health technology investments as well as focused device platform and mask technology development. We have introduced a new operating model centered on making ResMed even more product-led, even more customer-centric and even more brand enhanced. We will measure the success of this new 2030 operating model by an increase in the velocity of new product innovation as well as enhanced value in the ResMed brand while accelerating profitable growth. As the founder of ResMed states, innovation is not just invention of a great new technology is when a customer loves it, adopts it and chooses to pay for it. We have an incredible legacy and an exciting product pipeline to bring to market. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep health and breathing health business. Number two is to design and develop and deliver market-leading med tech and digital health solutions that can be scaled in 140 countries plus worldwide. Number three is to create and leverage the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in the home. In terms of addressing strategic priority, number one, as the world's clear leader in the field of sleep apnea and breathing health, we are laser-focused in 2024 on ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We are raising awareness and creating pathways for patients to find access to care for sleep suffocation across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels and investing in cost-effective social media-driven demand generation campaigns to help consumers who are concerned about their own sleep and breathing to find their way into screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathways. Our goal is to provide a digital healthcare concierge service to help guide people on that journey. We are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider-based ecosystem, which now contains more than 26 million patient records as well as the new user starts in myAir, which is a patient app where patients choose to participate in their own personalized healthcare journey to better sleep and better breathing. Our goal is to cost effectively drive more and more of the over 1 billion people worldwide who need our help into the channel. There are two megatrends that can have an influence on increasing that patient flow, one from big consumer tech and one from Big Pharma. Let me talk briefly about each of these megatrends. Many of the big consumer tech companies are increasing their focus on the area of sleep wellness. Apple has sleep wellness tracking built into its latest-generation Apple Watch and has plans to enhance that capability with further sleep quality assessment. Google's Fitbit division has sleep wellness tracking built into its platform. WHOOP is doing the same. Samsung have not only built sleep wellness tracking into its latest operating platform, but is helping to define sleep personas to help consumers better understand a 30% of their lives they spend in the state of sleep. We love this attention on the field of sleep wellness and many of these technologies will help each person find out if they have issues with sleep architecture, issues with breathing during sleep, or issues maintaining high quality sleep. This could be one of the biggest waves of people taking control of their own pathway for discovering they have sleep apnea or they have insomnia, well, maybe they have both, a state that is called COMISA for co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea. Ultimately, this will lead to increasing patient growth for ResMed overall. And our goal is to best educate the person as they move from sleep wellness tracking to sleep health tracking and from consumer awareness into a true healthcare pathway for screening, diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their chronic condition. ResMed plans to be there with the person through that entire journey. In terms of the impact of megatrends from Big Pharma, the current focus is squarely on GLP-1 medications. Let me take some time to address what we are seeing in the market with patients on latest-generation GLP-1 therapies and positive airway pressure therapy. We are tracking a cohort of over 0.5 million patients with prescriptions for both GLP-1 medications and positive airway pressure therapy. These data are included in our investor deck, so you can review them there on our website, but I'll briefly summarize what we have observed. Around six months ago, there was a thought among some in the market that patients on GLP-1 medications would be less likely to start positive airway pressure therapy. We stated at the time and still do, that this was not likely the case as important risk factors such as craniofacial geometry, gender, age and the basic physics and anatomy of the upper airway would remain unchanged despite this new pharmaceutical therapy option. Still, the theory remained. So now we have real-world data and real-world evidence at scale. Our analysis of over 529,000 patients with GLP-1 prescriptions shows that not only is there not a reduction in the propensity to start positive airway pressure therapy, it is the exact opposite. For patients who have been prescribed a GLP-1, there is an increase of 10% of the absolute percentage of patients that commence positive airway pressure therapy. So as an example, if you take a baseline of 75% of patients that commence PAP therapy after their prescription on average in a certain group, that would become 85% of those same patients who were on a GLP-1 that would commence positive airway pressure therapy. And by the way, the vast, vast majority of these GLP-1s are the latest generation medications. Another hypothesis about six months ago was that patients on GLP-1 therapy and PAP therapy would quit their PAP therapy, their CPAP or their APAP at a higher rate than the general population over time. The real world data, again, with a cohort of over 0.5 million patients shows the exact opposite. At T equals 12 months after therapy commencement on PAP, the delta from general PAP population to a PAP plus GLP-1 prescribed population shows an increase in the resupply rate of 300 basis points. So again, as an example, if the general population resupply rate at 12 months was, say, 70%, it would then become 73% for the population that was prescribed to both PAP and GLP-1 therapy. This delta actually increases over time going further with the delta from the general PAP population receiving resupply at 12 months being 500 basis points higher for a population prescribed both PAP and GLP-1s. Here at ResMed, we believe in treating the whole person, including a combination of what Professor Bill Dement, one of the founders of the field of sleep medicine, may he rest in peace, called the Triumvirate of Health. That triumvirate is one, regular cardiovascular exercise; two, balanced diet and nutrition; and three, good sleep and breathing. We believe that addressing all three aspects results in the best patient outcomes. In terms of best-in-class treatment for sleep apnea, achieving that goal of good sleep and good breathing, we have peer-reviewed and published research demonstrating that we can achieve over 87% of patients adherent to our PAP technology by combining our market-leading device platforms with digital health solutions, including AirView for physicians and myAir for patients. Even with this best-in-class global technology, we still have more than 10% of patients that need alternatives. We just can't get them adherent those 10%. We are investing in these alternative therapies and we are working to help patients who do not adhere to positive airway pressure to find their path to second-tier therapies, such as dental devices where ResMed has invested and scaled the market-leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called Narval. In addition, we have investments in other third-tier therapies, including pharmaceutical agents with our Apnimed investment as well as hypoglossal nerve stimulation technology with our Nyxoah investment. ResMed stands for respiratory medicine, not CPAP company, and we want to take care of the patient. We obviously start with the lowest cost, highest efficacy therapies, including CPAP, APAP and bilevel therapies. And we then work through the alternatives to help the person sleep better and breathe better. The bottom line is this, a huge number of people need our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next decade, two decades, three decades and beyond. We want every patient to find a path to good breathing and good sleep. Let's pivot for a moment to talk about our digital health technology investments, leveraging the 17 billion nights of de-identified medical data and the 23.5 million 100% cloud connectable devices in our ecosystem. We are investing in several artificial intelligence-driven data products and capabilities in that ecosystem that we call Air Solutions. We are continuing to roll out, one publicly we are talking about, which is called Compliance Coach to customers in the U.S. market in a controlled market launch. Compliance Coach is a solution that helps home medical equipment providers to prioritize both digital and personal outreach to improve patient compliance and drive better patient outcomes at a lower cost. Compliance Coach models and predict the likelihood that a particular patient will or will not adhere to therapy based on algorithms built on billions of data points. The AI product then identifies for the HME provider, the key patients who may struggle to meet compliance requirements and takes a step further to drive digital and/or human actions to maximize the probability of adherence across the group. Customers using the product in its initial launch are excited and are starting to see very positive results across their business and for their patients. One final update on AI technology for this quarter. We recently launched an in-market trial of a ResMed developed generative AI product that serves as a digital concierge to help a group of people that we call sleep-concerned consumers, to best navigate as they search for their sleep-related information and they ask questions about their sleep wellness and potential treatment options. This generative AI tool helps the person identify, engage and enroll on their personal journey to better sleep and better breathing. We are currently beta test marking this product in Asia Pacific, and we will look to scale globally over time. Our goal is to develop and scale this digital sleep concierge so that all those seeking better sleep and better breathing can find their personal pathway for the best outcome, the best treatment and the best long-term care. Our Respiratory Health business continues to be supported by sustained activity across our non-invasive ventilator platforms as well as our life support ventilator platforms. We continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy that we call HFT to even more cost effectively treat COPD in the home. As we develop these next-generation therapies, we will generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that will support broader adoption of these innovations for treating respiratory conditions at home. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase, and we offer low-cost, high-quality treatments to help address this healthcare epidemic. Turning to our Residential Care Software-as-a-Service business. We had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 24%. Organic growth of our SaaS business was solid across our Brightree and our MatrixCare brands with another full quarter contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN brand in Germany. Ongoing customer-facing synergies between our Brightree offering in the U.S. and our home medical equipment resupply revenue remains very strong, driving good growth across both our SaaS business and our core sleep health business. We expect to have sustainable organic growth across our portfolio of SaaS solutions in home medical equipment, home health, home nursing and beyond to be in the high-single digits as we continue through this fiscal year and to achieve stable double-digit organic growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. We continue to drive operating expense leverage through management of our capabilities for cloud compute, our capabilities for cybersecurity, interoperability and technology development and we plan to accelerate net operating profit growth across our SaaS portfolio and across the entire ResMed business. Our residential care SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market-leading software and the market-leading device solutions that we have in our sleep health and breathing health business, and we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential care. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential care at scale. We are leading the industry in developing, applying and adopting digital health technology across our markets. We continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations. We are focused on driving topline revenue growth, focused cost discipline and increased efficiencies to accelerate profitability. We have created differentiated products and solutions for customers worldwide, driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We lead the industry in digital health technology with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and we don't plan to stop innovating anytime soon. We invest around 7% of our revenues straight back into market-leading research and development. ResMed's mission remains crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission motivates me and ResMedians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 170 million lives by delivering a medical device directly to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that provides personal care for a patient. We've helped each person to sleep better, to breathe better or to live higher-quality lives with best-in-class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us and the pipeline we have ahead. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we'll open up to Q&A for Brett and me and the team. Over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, where applicable. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue for the December quarter was $1.16 billion, a 12% headline increase and 11% in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflects the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand and continued growth across our mask portfolio. Year-over-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $11 million in the December quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 9%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12%. Globally, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, masks and other sales increased by 10%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 16%, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices. Mask and other sales increased by 4%, reflecting the impact of a strong prior year comparable growth rate. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 24% in the December quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 10% in the December quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $28 million in the December quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note as we have now passed the first year anniversary of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, our future SaaS revenue year-over-year will reflect organic growth. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 56.9% in the December quarter. The increase primarily reflects a decrease in freight costs and increase in average selling prices and favorable foreign currency movements. The benefits are partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Sequential gross margin increased by 90 basis points, primarily driven by a reduction in freight costs and an increase in average selling prices for our devices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. We remain confident of a positive gross margin trajectory. Like many companies, we are monitoring potential headwinds that could arise in the Middle East conflict. Disruptions in the Red Sea will likely increase sea freight costs and shipping lead times. We're closely tracking the situation and taking action to mitigate potential impacts where we can. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 4%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.1% compared to 20.5% in the prior year period and reflects savings and cost discipline following specific actions taken early in the December quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. This guidance reflects the impact of our restructuring activities that resulted in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5% during the quarter. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4% compared to the 6.8% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 20%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and modest growth in our operating expenses. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter was $14 million. And as we continue to pay down debt, we expect interest expense to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 20.7% compared to 18.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a significant reduction in the tax benefit associated with employee equity compensation this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. During the quarter, we recorded $64.2 million of restructuring-related charges following an evaluation of our existing operations and actions undertaken to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability. Restructuring charges included $28.6 million of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities and $2.4 million of other asset impairments. The restructure charge has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. During the quarter, we also recorded a provision of $6.4 million for expected costs associated with the recently announced Masks with magnets field safety notification. This expense has been treated as a non-GAAP item in our Q2 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $273 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and relatively stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $23 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $210 million. On December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $130 million. On December 31, we had approximately $955 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As we advised last quarter, as part of our capital management activities, we resumed our previously authorized share buyback program in the December quarter. We purchased 335,000 shares for consideration of $50 million. We intend to continue to purchase approximately $50 million per quarter in the second half of fiscal year 2024. This will more than offset any dilution from the vesting of equity to employees during the year. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, pay down outstanding debt and deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Let's go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of our call. Kevin, I'd like to turn it over to you to provide the instructions and then run this part of the call.
Operator: Certainly, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Margaret Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now live. We do ask you ask limit yourselves to one question please.
Margaret Andrew: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good morning to everyone on the call. I wanted to maybe follow-up on your comments on GLP-1, even more so than the quarter. And I look at that 10% greater likelihood of folks starting CPAP when you're on a GLP, it seems like it could have a pretty meaningful impact for growth. And again, looking at it to say, if you're going from 75 patient new starts in a given period to 85, that's a 13% bigger market every year. So I guess conceptually, is that something that you agree with? Would it have a greater or less benefit impact if that trend continues? And I guess any comments on a real impact is over the next three years as GLP adoption grows? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Margaret. Look, it's a great question. And as a biomedical engineer, I look at this, and I don't know causality, I just know the correlation. And so we've now got data, the 529,000 data points that show that there's a 10% higher propensity to start PAP therapy if you prescribe the GLP-1 before and then you get the PAP therapy, 10 absolute percentage points higher of the cohort will start PAP therapy. My thought is that this is a more motivated patient, a more engaged patient in the health care system, and they've been brought in by this new therapeutic tool. And so I do think that it will lead to greater growth. This megatrend of GLP-1s will lead to greater growth of patients coming into our treatment pool over time. And certainly, the data is showing that with that cohort of patients. Yes, your quick math there of an increase, I think, is that if there's full penetration across the whole patient cohort and full adoption GLP-1s across every patient coming through. Of course, that's the maximum state. But I think realistically, as we see this pretty fast rollout of this new pharmaceutical class, we will start to see more patients come into the health care system. Everyone is seeing that across medtech and across health care. They are more engaged and they do seem to be getting prescriptions for many different chronic diseases. Sleep apnea is non-exception. And we've got probably one of the highest number of patients in that cohort of over 0.5 million patients that we're tracking. And of course, we've got 26 million patients in our database. So this is a minority of patients that we're seeing on these, but it is interesting within that cohort to see a higher participation rate. Look, our goal will be to leverage that megatrend and to make sure that ResMed is there with the best tools for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. And we've done that over decades, and we plan to do it ahead. I think maybe the consumer big tech trend of sleep wellness tracking might be slightly higher in its impact over time, maybe not as quick adoption, but these sleep wellness tools come across all consumer tech applications is incredibly exciting. ResMed's goal is there to leverage this demand gen that's coming to us from Big Pharma and big consumer tech, but then more importantly, to get that personalized health journey so that ResMed can be truly the concierge for that person if they find their path to better sleep and better health. So we do expect these trends to be positive. They won't be immediate. And our job is to drive it over time.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a good quarter here. Maybe Mick will stay on GLP-1s, we're getting a lot of attention turning toward the Eli Lilly SURMOUNT-OSA study. And maybe the KPIs that you're looking for in that study how relevant do you think the primary endpoint is? Are there other secondary endpoints that are more important? And do you think over time you can collaborate with Lilly to drive the effort of using CPAP with the GLP-1? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And it's a really pertinent one. Certainly, we're watching this SURMOUNT-OSA trial. It's a pretty small trial. It's less than 500 patients, 500, 600 patients, I believe. So it's not sort of the order of the real world event, real-world data that we have, like 500,000 patients we're talking about there. But I think it will be very interesting to see the presumption is given it's the same biochemical compound as in other trials used for diabetes treatment and weight loss that it will have somewhere in the order of 10%, 20%, maybe even 30% weight loss reduction in this cohort. So that's a metric that's sort of well-known from prior studies. The best evidence from the primary investigator on this Professor Atul Malhotra from University of California, San Diego. His assessment is that, that should lead to pretty significant AHI reductions in the treatment cohort versus placebo, maybe in the order of to maybe 65% AHI reductions in the cohort of these quite high BMI and quite high AHI patients. If you listen to a great podcast between Professor Malhotra and Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, which are available on our website. When you've got to spare 45 minutes, but there are some cliff notes that I think are worth sharing here in this investor call is that Professor Malhotra was asked what's the best therapy to treat sleep apnea. Is it, a, weight loss? Or is it b, CPAP. And he said, "Well, that's a false dichotomy, this question, it's a false competition. It's a plus b. It has been for decades and will be for decades in the future. And as a PI on that study, he says, look, we have a new pharmaceutical agent that's going to help with treatment a. And of course, that will be used in combination with treatment B. So the PI on the study is saying that he thinks the combination treatment of a weight loss medication similar to prior work and bariatric surgery that had much higher weight loss numbers or diet and exercise that had all the variance that we've seen over decades of different methodologies there. But this one does seem to be a good agent for treatment a. And then will need to be combined with treatment b to fully treat the sleep suffocation that the patients will have. So don't trust me, the CEO of the company that makes the therapeutic, trust the primary investigator that's saying, combination treatment has worked for decades and will work for decades. I would expect that to be the outcome the trial. And in terms of working with Big Pharma on this, I think they're very focused on other areas like obesity and diabetes, but as much as we can get their attention to talk about sleep and sleep health and to do their D2P advertising to talk about the importance of sleep and sleep health. I think combined with the Apples and the Samsungs and the Googles of the world talking about it, it will be a huge positive for of us in the sleep apnea treatment industry. Thanks for the question, Anthony.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Michael Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll just ask one on Philips. So I think they've talked about relaunching their flow generators in some of the OUS markets, just curious what you're seeing there? Have you seen that happening? And have they been able to recapture share anywhere?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And yes, certainly in tens of countries in Europe and Asia. We are in full competition with all the global players, including the company you mentioned and the large regionals from Europe and from Asia and have been for many quarters. So they've come back in masks and devices across tens of countries in Europe and Asia. And their goal there when they come back, if they've been out for a year or two, depending on the time they're out of each market is to fight their way from the bottom. They've got zero percent new patient start share when they first come back in and they're trying to fight their way up. And in general, they had to fight against the number two, the number three and the number four player who don't have like ResMed has the leading technology, the best AirSense platform, right. The AirSense 11 globally is the best platform in all 140 countries. The second best platform in, I would say, all 140 countries is the AirSense 10 platform. So their goal is to then fight against regional player from Europe with the number three or a regional player from Asia, with the number four in the country that they're coming back. And so we're seeing that country by country. We're seeing them fight for that share at the low end. It's our focus as the market leader is on growing the market. And I think they're a fair competitor. We've competed against them for decades since they bought Respironics. And in general, we've won and taken share. We were winning and taking share from them in 2019. We're winning and taking share from the 2023 and 2024 as they come back country by country. And if and when they come back to the U.S. marketing devices, by the way, they're already here on masks, never left, and we've been competing and leading them there. I look forward to them coming back to the U.S. market so we can get any stock overhang away about what's it going to look like and what it's going to look like is what it looks like in all the other tens of countries where they fight for share from the bottom and work their way up. And I look forward to competition, a healthy competition. And we seem to do very well in it because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and most intelligent solutions, and it's really about that. It's about the value you provide getting that patient to the right care, lowering the cost and improving adherence. And we've done a great job, and I like all global competition in the space.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Hey, Mick, can you hear me all right?
Michael Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Congrats on the nice quarter. So Mick, in the 2030 operating model, right? If I got your commentary right, ResMed brand and profitability, velocity of product control some of these things that you highlighted, I guess, way does Compliance Coach fit within the 2030 strategic model? More specifically, I'm just trying to understand how do you measure the ROI in the Compliance Coach. And I presume this is going to be a primarily a reactive AI model. Any additional clarity would be great? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Well, thanks, Suraj. I could spend the rest of the time answering that call around the 2030 operating model. I'll just briefly talk about it and then talk specifically about Compliance Coach. Our 2030 operating model, yes, it's the three tenets, right? The three tenets product-led, customer-centric brand enhanced. ResMed has always been product led, but now we have a Global Chief Product Officer, whose sole role is to curate that product portfolio with an amazing team of hundreds of engineers and marketers to bring the great innovation to market. So we'll measure the success on that on product velocity, how quickly do we bring innovation to market, time to market, time to success. Customer-centric. We've always been customer-centric. But we have always done the best of analyzing the Net Promoter Scores of patients, Net Promoter Scores of physicians, home care providers. Physician payer providers and so on. So really understanding the marketing metrics around that, having our first Chief Marketing Officer sit at the top table and really be laser-focused on those NPS scores and driving them up and really valuing the multibillion-dollar ResMed brand and enhancing that over time. And the third part around focusing on profitable growth and driving that leverage with our first Chief Revenue Officer, it's really around that profitable growth. And if the title was used broadly, I would call it the Chief Profitable Growth Officer rather than Chief Revenue Officer, but really, it's around keeping that discipline on the great growth we've had on the topline, but ensuring we get that leverage through OpEx R&D and particularly on SG&A in the new world to do things differently with tech.  And that segues into the second part of your question, Compliance Coach. Yes, look, this is a great AI tool. By the way, it's not generative AI Compliance Coach. The other one that we launched in Asia Pacific, the digital concierge is generative AI and has that extra capability. Compliance Coach is [garden-variety], what would have been called machine learning is now artificial intelligence, it's a great algorithm, and it's out there. The measure of that one, success on that one, Suraj, is does it lower the cost to serve at that HME or with the same labor force of respiratory therapists and pulmonary doctors can they serve more patients. So lower cost, higher efficiency, and really, the key metric is what's the adherence rate at day 90, day 365, year two, year three, in that patient cohort that's gone through Compliance Coach. Is it statistically and significantly higher than what that customer was getting before? If they're a best-in-class ResMed customer getting 87% adherence at day 90, does it go up to 90, does it go up to 92. And by the way, those customers are very sophisticated in understanding what that means for their business, what it means for them showing the payers that they reduce costs in hospital care and that they improve outcomes for the patient and how they feel and of course, how they improve their own revenue and hours through replenishment supplies. Anyway, that's my – the briefest answer I could do to that great question. Thanks, Suraj.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.
Steven Wheen: Yes. Good morning. Just a question for Brett. Brett, I was just wondering if we could look into the gross margin a little bit further and trying to understand, are we seeing in – across that quarter, the full benefit of the price that you've taken? Or is that some annualization effect as some customers perhaps roll off contracts and whether or not from a rate perspective, could you just kind of reiterate what your expectations are there, what you're seeing with regard to the pricing following the conflict?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Sure, Steve. So yes, I mean, on the gross margin and recent price increases we put through during the quarter, some of those are obviously be contractual arrangements there as well. So we've put some – some of it's gone through as a general increase, and then there will be specific contractual arrangements that means those pricing will be a little bit progressive. I guess if you look over the back half of fiscal 2024 on that. So let's call that be kind of progressively roll through. But we're definitely seeing some of that impact already on that. I think the second part of your question was around – is that around the sort of freight Red Sea disruptions and so on?
Steven Wheen: Yes. Just what you were sort of intimating, if you could just repeat that commentary, what you're seeing in the market and how you actually are trying to anticipate or protect yourselves against that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Yes. So we're definitely seeing the impact there and a lot of that shipping is obviously not going through the Red Sea, but then going around kind of good hope. So that's happening certainly increased lead times, I think, probably you could be looking at two to three weeks on that. Particularly, this is a particularly trading to Europe in particular, but also to some extent, to the U.S. where you've got to find alternate freight paths, if you like. So that's having an impact. And we're also seeing some increase in actual freight rates as well. And I think this is an industry wide not just ourselves. So we're looking at that closely. We're looking at alternative routes. We're looking at multimodal distribution there. So there's a number of things we're looking at to mitigate that where we can. But it realistically probably see some uptick in freight cross. It would not manifest in our P&L in Q3, but there could be some headwinds in Q4 on that. But again, I think we've just got to see how that evolves over the next little while.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good afternoon, good morning. Just another question for Brett. Brett, just regarding the restructuring charges and also the charge for the Mask recall. Is that done now in terms of those P&L costs? Or do you expect any further costs to be incurred in third quarter or indeed fourth quarter this fiscal year? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yes we’re largely through that. I mean, I can't – I don't think you can rule out restructures from time to time, but I think the material restructure that we did is behind us now. So going – anything going forward, I think, would be pretty minor on that. So I would say – I'd characterize that as saying, yes, we've done the big restructure, and that should clear us now for the next…
Michael Farrell: Just to jump in there, Brett, a little bit specifically to Saul's question about the mask with magnets upgrade of our labeling, which was classed as a recall in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions. That cost was fully taken account of in this quarter. We're not expecting to add anything more on the mask with magnets action relabel and recall in certain jurisdictions.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi. Your line is now live.
Mathieu Chevrier: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Simple one, when do you expect to be fully transitioned the AirSense 11 platform?
Michael Farrell: Mathieu, a very simple question, but rather complex answer in that we sell in 140 countries worldwide, and each of them most of them have their own regulatory pathway and often very different and complex and obviously, labeling language customization of the product for all regulatory requirements needed in all those 140 countries. So we clearly launched in our top countries were launched in the U.S. many countries in Europe. We just got Japan last quarter, the quarter before and we're starting to ramp up there. And you saw that in the good growth numbers in devices in Europe, Asia and other in the quarter of 16%, there was some good sort of starting that ramp there in a place like Japan, which, as you know, is a fleet driven market versus a by-quarter driven market. And so great to see Japan – the citizens of Japan to be able to get access to the best in the world technology in the AirSense 11. But look, we've got hundreds of countries – over 100 countries, we still have to go there. And so we've got to get regulatory country by country. And we care about people suffocating in all of those 140 countries in the same way. And so our regulatory and quality team with Dawn Haake, our Chief Quality and Regulatory Officer working intensely with all the regulatory authorities in those countries and we have to ramp that up. And then in addition, we're ramping up supply. The good news is that we have the second best platform in the world in the AirSense 10, and that is completely unconstrained. So you do suffocate and get a prescription in the country that AirSense 11 is not cleared yet, you can get access to incredibly small, quiet and efficacious therapy in the AirSense 10 platform and our best in the world mask platform. And so there's no simple answer to when it will be completely done in 100% in all countries because I think as indifferent to maybe the AirSense 7 to AirSense 8, AirSense 8 to AirSense 9 and AirSense 9 to AirSense 10 generations is that we have a pretty unique situation with our global citizenship here. We are the global leader, and we've got a different responsibility to maintain our second best platform, which is the second best in the world for a little longer. And so that will be out. And I'm not going to give a defined end date now, but I will tell you this. We're going country by country, we're driving regulatory and we're scaling manufacturing as fast as we can on AirSense 11 because it is better technology, is low cost to make, and we are able to have a premium for it in pricing. So it makes sense for us, the customers and for our shareholders.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Matt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the SURMOUNT study. I think you outlined a lot of the high-level stuff there really well. My question is a little more specific. I wanted to ask about what you thought you could see in terms of comparing the two arms of GLP-1 versus CPAP plus GLP-1? Do you think you'll see a difference there what would you make of their results if there is a different one way or the other?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And so for those of you who haven't read through the nih.gov, feel free to go. But my reading, I'm a visual learner. There's a split chart that the top half of it on the trial is a GLP-1 side and the bottom half is a placebo side. And so they have this 600-odd or less than 600 patients split between those two in a certain proportion. And then within the GLP-1 arm, they split to those on CPAP and those not on CPAP and the same within the placebo. So there ends up being four arms if you look at it. But if you go to the end of it, there's an arm that's placebo, no CPAP. So I'd just call that the placebo arm. And then there's placebo plus CPAP arm and then there's GLP alone arm and GLP plus PAP arm. So you start to get down to the subanalyses, it gets less powered. I actually – I'm reading what you are on nih.gov. So my presumption is at the highest level, they want to show that a GLP-1 is better than placebo for lowering weight and improving AHI. I think they'll achieve that primary outcome. I mean all the data show that there's 10%, 20%, 30% weight loss reduction and that should correlate to significant AI reduction. So I think they'll show that. As opposed to then the sub-studies of CPAP versus no CPAP within each of those, look, we've got 35 years of history knowing that CPAP doesn't half treat, right? I mean, the best that I've seen from weight loss reductions in bariatric surgeries and the best the GLP-1 prelim data is that it can half treat, right? Maybe 50% reduction in AHI. I'd call that half treatment. I don't think any pulmonary physician in the world would be happy with half treating an AHI with positive airway pressure. Frankly, if you're not turning the AHI to less than five, you're not truly treating the patient. And if it's higher than five, it might be residual centrals and you have to move them to a bilevel or it might be complex sleep apnea have to move them to adaptive servo-ventilation. So there's so many options between CPAP, APAP bilevel ASV that the physicians should walk through, but they wouldn't be happy unless the AHI is less than 5%. I think the probability – and don't trust me and my quote on this, Matt. Again, the primary investigator on the study, Professor Malhotra said, the idea that weight loss alone can treat sleep apnea is preposterous. That was the word he used. So you can use – and he's the PI on this study. You can use his thoughts to what he thinks between the PAP arm and the non-PAP arm. So he's sort of leaning towards what he said earlier, that best treatment for sleep apnea is not a) weight loss or b) CPAP, it's a plus b. And so that's what I expect this study to show. And we'll see the data. They will be out there in three weeks and whatever they want to release in headline and we'll continue to go. We'll continue to grow. We'll continue to drive patients into the funnel, and I think this therapeutic class will help us over the coming decade to bring more patients into the funnel.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Yes. Good morning, Mike. So, Mick, Brett, and Amy. I might ask a question about your device and mask sales there. So obviously, strong device sales, your resupply programs, obviously, giving that some focus. But masks this quarter came out weaker than where we expected. Can you talk us through where the disconnect there might be?
Michael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And yes, really, really happy to take questions and talk about our devices business and our mask business. So look, devices growth globally, incredibly strong in the quarter at 11%. Masks growth globally incredibly strong at 9%. We talk about the market being mid-single-digit growth for devices, so we’re clearly well ahead of that with the launch of AirSense 11 in Japan and Europe, Asia Rest of World and doing well in the U.S. a couple of hundred basis points above. And then in masks and accessory, you talked about global growth being in high single digits. And so beating that in U.S., Canada, Latin America, but what you're probably focusing on is the Europe, Asia and Rest of World growth there in Q2 FY2024 being 4%, right? And just to be clear, the Q2 FY2023 growth in that same category was 14%. And we were taking 500 basis points a share 12 months ago and then losing it this quarter. I really think if you look at the weighted average over that, which is, what, 18 divided by 2 is 9% is sort of more in line with the market growth in that mid- to high single-digit growth of masks there. And look, there's some things around some contracts with the particular countries that were moved from December to January and others. I'm not going to go to all the details other than to say, we look really closely at share. We look really closely at what we're doing. And this 90-day snapshot four quarters ago, which showed 14%. We weren't taking 500 basis points a share. We were holding share, growing in a little – a category here or there. And now this quarter at 4%, we're not losing 500 bps a share. We're actually holding share across that and it's due to some of those shipping areas – launch areas and frankly, a couple of tenders that will move from one month to another. So really not much to see in that. But what I will say is that as we move forward, maintaining that high single-digit growth in devices globally, and the high – sorry, mid-single-digit growth in devices globally and high single-digit growth in masks globally is not a given. We've got to drive that demand. We've got to leverage this Big Pharma trend. We've got to leverage the big tech trend – and we've got to get better at doing demand generation in the areas where we know we can push it up. And so that's what we're going to be focused on going forward. I hope that answers your question, Lyanne.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.
Michael Polark: Hey, good afternoon. I will ask a mask question as well following up there in a slightly different way. So the U.S. number was up 2% sequentially. Normally, you see a high single-digit increase Q-over-Q kind of year-end seasonality in the U.S. deductible flush, that kind of thing. Kind of what are the puts and takes in that number? And the specific question is, did the Magnet field safety notice kind of limit your ability to fully capture mass demand in the quarter? Or were there other influences? Thank you so much.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Great question, Michael. So yes, U.S., Canada and Latin America, a 10% growth in the mask in the quarter. It was actually a very strong market growth rate, high single digits, holding share there. We do see that December, particularly for U.S. markets where high deductibles and deductibles reset December 31, some good revenue there. And so we had good comp from the year before, and both solid numbers there from the comp year before this 10% U.S. Canada Latin America growth. So I think we did really well there as we closed out the quarter. In terms of any impact from the masks with magnets update on our labeling class in the U.S. by the U.S. FDA as a recall. I got to tell you, there was no product removed from the market. This was about having our plastic clips as an option, which we scaled up manufacturing and have them as an option. So when a patient is set up, if they're a very, very small minority of people who haven't implanted pacemaker or other metal device in their upper chest or craniofacial area, then those patients are offered an upgrade to the plastic clips. For everyone else, the other 95%, 99% of patients they keep the convenience of the magnet. So that if they go to the bathroom in the night, they can come back in the dark and just clip it on and not have to seek for plastic clips to click together the magnet completely goes on there. And so as we've done that labeling upgrade, and we had a competitor do this similar one about 12 months ago, the market has been very trained in knowing to ask questions about implants to ask questions about our partner's implants. And if they have that to offer the plastics clips, which are fully available on ResMed masks as an alternative to our mass with magnets. The masks with magnets are so convenient. They're doing so well and for 99% of people, they're great. For that 1%, the HMEs are very comfortable now to ask those questions. And the other 140 countries we are working through the appropriate ways to ask the questions and get people the best mask and have the best fit and drive the best adherence over time. But they had no impact on the quarterly sales whatsoever. And we don't expect an impact going forward because this was an upgrade to a labeling that was actually in line with clinical practice over the last 12 months. And it just makes sense to do that. Thanks a lot for the question, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on this call. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped. It's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the health care system, and this will benefit us as we seek to help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. Thank you to all 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders for what you do today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call back to Amy to close this out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone, for listening. We do appreciate your time and your interest. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can go ahead and close this out.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-10-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ResMed First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal Year 2024. We are live webcasting this call and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer, to answer any questions you may have. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP reported numbers. In addition, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We make these statements based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results could differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today. Our first quarter fiscal year 2024 results reflect strong growth across our entire business with double digit top line growth. This growth was driven by double digit global growth in the masks category and double digit growth in our software as a service business. We also achieved high single digit global growth in devices even as that category annualizes very high growth in the prior year period. The flexible and agile work of our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution teams has enabled us to provide ongoing global availability of our market leading 100% cloud connectable flow generator platforms. We have unconstrained supply of our AirSense platforms enabled by excellent volumes of the AirSense 10 platform globally and fast ramping approvals, launches and delivery of the best-in-class AirSense 11 platform country by country. During the quarter, we accelerated delivery of the AirSense 11 in Japan, and we launched the AirSense 11 in Australia and New Zealand. We have plenty of runway ahead on our pathway to launch in all of the 140 countries where we sell our solutions. We are very proud to be able to support all global demand for flow generators through a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. We remain laser focused on accelerating the production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform. We are moving swiftly on that front. Our Masks and Accessories business grew 21% year-over-year, amongst a highly competitive market with all global players on the field in this category. Our commercial teams are doing an amazing job of showing the clinical and economic benefits of the ResMed mask portfolio. Our clinical and commercial teams are also partnering with physicians and provider customers to drive resupply programs directly with patients. The peer reviewed and published clinical evidence showing that adoption of a resupply program leads to better patient outcomes is proving itself out in the real world customer by customer. We continue to see strong growth in the US mask business where provider resupply programs can scale, powered by our digital health ecosystem, including AirView for physicians and providers and myAir for patients. For patients around the world, especially in nonreimbursed markets, we are developing, launching and scaling outreach and subscription programs to help the consumer who is the ultimate customer to take control of their own health and engage directly in refreshing their mask, tubing, humidifier and other accessories. This has been a permanent uptick since COVID-19. People care about respiratory health and respiratory hygiene and they are taking action, and we are supporting them with digital solutions and services to meet their needs. Before I turn to review updates on our key strategic priorities, I'd like to spend a little time discussing actions we've taken to accelerate profitable growth across ResMed and to power our long term success. We've taken immediate steps to ensure we're prioritizing the right things to drive profitable growth and our leadership teams have carefully reviewed opportunities to improve our performance. We have stopped some projects that were not working out as well as we thought. We've increased investment in areas that we believe will be pivotal to long term success, such as our digital health tech investments as well as focused hardware and software development. Creating the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected and the most intelligent healthcare solutions in the market. These changes have impacted some of our teams. And this week, we have taken actions that resulted in a reduction of our global workforce by 5%. Decisions like this that impact people are never easy. However, we know that we are doing the right thing, and we're doing the right thing to accelerate our growth and to refocus on our long term mission. I feel more strongly than ever that we are well positioned with an incredibly long runway of profitable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders as we move forward. Let's now turn to a discussion of our three key strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core Sleep Apnea and Respiratory Care business; number two, to design, develop and deliver market leading medical technology as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. There are over 2 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease and insomnia. There are millions more that we can support as they navigate the complex outside hospital healthcare system. We believe that healthcare should be delivered in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest comfort location possible. Very often, that is a patient's own home. We have a massive opportunity ahead of us to help hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Our end markets remain incredibly underpenetrated with many opportunities to add value, reduce friction, lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Now that we've been able to comfortably support overall global market demand for sleep devices for the last few quarters, we're ramping up our demand generation initiatives. We're investing in marketing efforts to raise awareness and patient engagement across specific global markets. We are leveraging traditional healthcare channels as well as investing in cost effective direct-to-consumer demand gen campaigns to help what we call sleep concern consumers, find their way into the screening, diagnostic, treatment and management pathway. We will act as a digital concierge to guide patients on that journey. In terms of analyzing the results of these efforts to date and ongoing, we are tracking new patient starts in our physician and provider based ecosystem, AirView, which now has more than 22.5 million patients, as well as the new user starts in myAir where patients themselves choose to participate in their personalized healthcare journey to better breathing and better sleep. Patient flow into the funnel is at an all time high. We are well above the rates that we saw pre-COVID in 2019 across all geographies, triple digits across the board. The bottom line is that we are driving strong growth of patients into the funnel. We believe the work that's being done in the pharmaceutical industry right now with obesity drugs will be a net positive for patient flow and patient growth in sleep apnea, COPD and for ResMed overall. In terms of existing patients in our installed base, we are actively tracking a cohort of many thousands of patients on these GLP-1 medications and LPAT therapy. We are not seeing any significant change in the PAP adherence rates nor any reduced participation in resupply programs versus control groups. These data indicate that there is a cohort of patients on combined therapies in a stable state. In terms of new patients activated into the funnel, we are seeing the number of new patients activated into the healthcare funnel picking up. We see patient flow is not only strong but increasing. We believe in treating the whole person here at ResMed, including a combination of cardiovascular exercise, diet and nutrition as well as good sleep and breathing. That combination was called the Triumvirate of Health by Professor Bill Dement from Stanford, may he rest in peace. And we think a combination of these three elements will result in the best outcomes for patients. It is quite possible that this new class of drugs may become as large or even larger than the cholesterol class or the blood pressure treatment class of pharmaceuticals. If this is the case, we will see a whole new population of patients activated with their primary care providers that we may never have seen in the healthcare system. If this comes to pass, we may see benefits for the entire health system and for the people being treated themselves and for ResMed, as more and more people are evaluated and screened for sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency and other key chronic conditions as part of their primary care evaluations. Our data are showing an all time high of patient flow and that supports this thesis. Stepping back and looking at the science in the field of respiratory medicine, we have created a forward-looking epidemiology model for our core market sleep apnea, spanning over two to three decades into the future. We have assumed an aggressive case for high market penetration of this new class of pharmaceuticals. We will publish the epidemiology model in our investor deck straight after this call. The model starts using a baseline of the global prevalence of sleep apnea, which was 936 million people in 2015. And this is based on peer reviewed and published data from the Journal Lancet in 2019. Our epidemiology model grows with conservative population and aging assumptions to a prevalence of around 1.4 billion people suffering from sleep apnea in 2050. We then overlaid an aggressive assumption for the adoption of this new pharmaceutical class globally. We assumed some of the highest penetration rates that we have seen reported by analysts in the industry. With this aggressive and sustained adoption of the new drug class, we forecast that the global prevalence of sleep apnea will still be around 1.2 billion people in 2050. Now in terms of the market penetration of our PAP therapy into this population, we have assumed market growth from our 22.5 million patients with PAP therapy here at the end of calendar year 2023 using steady state market growth rates that we saw in the years leading up to 2019, that is mid single digit growth for devices and high single digit growth for masks. With these growth rates, we reached around 109 million patients on our PAP therapy by 2050. That leaves 1.1 billion people remaining in the addressable market in 2050, over and above those already on our PAP treatment. We will continue to update our epidemiology model with all the new data as they arise. However, the bottom line is that there remains a huge number of people needing our sleep apnea treatment solutions today and for the next two to three decades and beyond. While we're proud that we have peer reviewed and published data showing that we can achieve over 87% adherence of patients to our PAP technology, combining our best-in-class med tech hardware with our digital health solutions AirView and myAir, that still means 10% of our patients on an annual basis will need alternatives. We are investing in those alternative therapies, and we are actively working with direct -- to direct patients who do not adhere to pack that 10%-plus to second line therapies, such as dental devices, where we have invested and scaled the market leading 3D printed dental device for sleep apnea in Europe called [Narval]. In addition, we have investments in other second line therapies, including pharmaceuticals and hypoglossal nerve stem technology. We want every patient who suffocates at night to find a path to good breathing and good sleep, and it looks like there's 1 billion of them we need to help. We start with the highest efficacy and lowest cost therapy, which is PAP technology, where we have very high adherence rates and the best outcomes for patients and we go from there. Given this incredible multiple decades long plus runway of growth and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline that end-to-end patient pathway and to make it easier for sleep physicians and sleep labs to diagnose and manage these patients, we're excited about our Somnoware acquisition that we closed during the last quarter. Somnoware is software for pulmonary and really all sleep physicians. And it complements our current portfolio of software offerings for physicians, homecare providers and patients, including AirView, Brightree and myAir, respectively. The goal is to ultimately drive greater efficiency and better patient care by helping physicians to take best-in-class care of their patients with increased efficiency and a better overall experience for the doctor and for the patient. We're making progress across several digital health technology initiatives to drive the value proposition of our cloud connected devices even higher. We are investing in several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities in our Air Solutions ecosystem. This quarter, we started rolling out a digital product in our US market called Compliance Coach. Compliance Coach is built for home care providers to help them efficiently focus efforts and prioritize outreach to increase patient compliance and ultimately to drive better patient outcomes by helping them meet and beat 90-day adherence goals. The application utilizes ResMed's many billions of nights of de-identified sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud to predict the likelihood that a patient will be adherent to therapy or not. The AI product then advises and coaches the home care provider to best identify the patients who may struggle and to meet compliance requirements where they can so they can prioritize their interventions and outreach to the best probabilities to support patient success. It's early in our rollout program of Compliance Coach. However, customers using the product are excited and engaged and are starting to see results. Watch this space for many more ways that we can work with all of our customers to unlock value from incredible depth of de-identified data using tech like AI and ML for the ultimate benefit of physicians, providers and patients. Let me discuss the forward pathway stemming from our joint venture with Verily right now that was called Primasun. Based on a mutual agreement between ResMed and Verily, we've made the decision to unwind the joint venture's day-to-day operations. We expect this to be complete by the end of the current quarter. Over the past years of this partnership, we've learned how to leverage technology to better identify, engage, diagnose and manage sleep concern consumers in our US market. We expect to take ownership of key assets of the Primasun developed model so that we can build on the investment and the learnings and ultimately accelerate our ongoing demand generation efforts with sleep apnea patients across ResMed. It is exciting to take the learning from demand gen work in one project and in one country and to now look to apply that on a global scale across the 140 countries where we provide solutions. Our growing Respiratory Care business continues to be supported by the increased adoption of both noninvasive and life support ventilator solutions. In terms of next-gen respiratory care therapies, we continue to invest in clinical and economic trials for high flow therapy, that we call HFT, with the goal of cost effectively treating COPD in the home. We continue to generate strong clinical evidence and economic outcomes that we believe will support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We believe this has the potential for future growth for ResMed over the medium to long term. We remain focused on addressing COPD as one of the top three chronic diseases for hospitalization and the number one cause of rehospitalization. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focusing and developing and plan to offer low cost, high quality solutions to address this healthcare epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 32%. SaaS business growth was powered by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business in Germany, as well as high single-digit organic growth across our Brightree and MatrixCare brands in the US market. The sustained high single digit organic growth in our SaaS business is driven by strength in the HME segment and stability as well as increased tech adoption by customers in the facilities segment. We see a pathway to stable double digit organic growth across the SaaS business, as well as increased net operating profit performance from this part of our business. The ongoing synergies between our digital health solutions in SaaS and our core business remains strong, and we continue to leverage that through combined management of cloud compute, cyber security, interoperability, tech dev as well as customer facing synergies, including patient resupply technology in our core business. During the quarter, we appointed Greg Timmons as the new General Manager of our Brightree business. I'm excited to support Greg and Bobby to continue to drive growth in our home medical equipment providers and to help our customers across the US market. This quarter, I traveled to Hildesheim, Germany to meet in person with the entire team from our MEDIFOX DAN business. The growth in tech solutions for ambulant home nursing as well as stationary nursing home businesses is very strong in Germany with an aging population in that country and a government that is driving care to be more home based through their policies and more digital through their policies. We see a long runway for growth with our MEDIFOX DAN team and across our global software as a service business. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions we have in our respiratory medicine business. And we are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. And we have created differentiated value for customers and will drive long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Before we get into a detailed update on our financials, let me say this here at ResMed. We are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology across our markets. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations, we will leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive profitable growth. We're focused on driving top line revenue and tight cost discipline as well as increased efficiencies so that we can accelerate profitability, delivering value for all of our stakeholders and especially the 2 billion patients plus worldwide who need our help. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I'm confident on laser focus that we will continue to see improvements in our gross margin with GM leverage programs focused on five key areas. Number one, to drive the launch of AirSense 11 into new global markets and to increase the availability of AirSense 11 ultimately in all the country markets that we serve. Number two, to drive ongoing strong mask growth with a combination of resupply programs, subscription programs and new product launches, and you can see that's working this quarter. Number three, to increase software solutions growth, moving from high single digit organic growth to double digit organic growth with increased net operating profit leverage in that segment. Number four, to move the higher cost components and freight costs that we've seen through our legacy through our P&L, turning what was a supply chain crisis headwind into a steady tailwind as we move through fiscal year 2024. And number five, to implement cost reduction actions in noncore areas of our business to free up cash and to accelerate investments in market leading medtech and digital health solutions. So in terms of Digital Health Investments and Solutions, we now have over 16 billion nights of de-identified medical data in the cloud and over 22.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices sold in more than 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health technology and we don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. ResMed's mission and key goal remain crystal clear to improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMed-ians every day. During the last 12 months, we have improved over 165 million lives with the delivery of a medical device directly to a patient, a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live high quality lives with best in class healthcare delivered right where they live. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the 10,000 ResMed-ians for their perseverance, their hard work, their dedication, both today and every day. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney. And after Brett's remarks, we will open up for Q&A from the entire group. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1. Group revenue for the September quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support solid underlying global demand as well as strong growth across our mask product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies positively impacted revenue by approximately $10 million in the September quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 10%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 18%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 21%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 2%, which reflects the fact that we are cycling a particularly higher prior year comparable that was driven by sales of our card to cloud devices. Masks and other sales increased by 23%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 20% in constant currency terms, again, reflecting strong demand and significantly improved availability of cloud connected devices [Technical Difficulty] these patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 32% in the September quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the September quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $25.7 million for the September quarter, consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Note, we will anniversary this acquisition in Q2 FY24, so our headline SaaS growth rate will moderate in Q2. Turning to my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers where we’ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 160 basis points to 56% in the September quarter. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in component and manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix due to the increase in mask growth relative to device growth and favorable foreign currency movements. Sequential gross margin improved by 20 basis points, driven primarily by favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 15% or in constant currency terms increased by 14%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with the MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 20.2% compared to the 20.3% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 18% to 20% for fiscal year '24. This guidance also reflects the impact of restructuring we initiated earlier this week and we estimate this will result in a reduction in our workforce of approximately 5%. We expect to complete the restructure during our second quarter of fiscal year '24. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 20% or in constant currency terms increased by 21%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the 6.6% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '24. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 10%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter over the balance of fiscal year '24. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.1%, broadly consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '24 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the September quarter increased by 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.64 also increased by 9%. During the quarter, we recorded a provision of $8 million associated with the expected cost of the recently announced Astral field safety notification. We also recorded acquisition related expenses of $0.5 million during the quarter. These both have been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q1 financial results. We recorded losses of $4.5 million in our September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. As Mick discussed, the joint venture will be winding down operations and we will incur no further losses going forward in relation to Primasun. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $286 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings and stable working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million and depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $45 million. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $209 million, and at September 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $80 million. At September 30, we had approximately $825 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. During the quarter, we also closed our previously announced Somnoware acquisition, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. As part of our capital management activities, we plan to resume our previously authorized share buyback program starting in our second quarter. We expect to purchase shares to the value of approximately $50 million per quarter. This will more than offset any dilution from the issue of employee equity during the year. Finally, concurrent with our capital management activities, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and turn the call back over to you to remind participants about instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.
David Bailey: Mick, I'd just like to press a bit more on some of the comments around the market to 2050. Just interested in your thoughts around GLP-1s as potentially being complementary to CPAP as opposed to being a substitution for. And maybe just giving some thoughts around the upcoming clinical trials and how that could influence that will take going forward?
Mick Farrell: And I'm just happy that we've had 90 days and we put some sites behind the analysis of this as the world leader in the field of respiratory medicine and sleep apnea, we really know these prevalence numbers really well. And so that baseline of 936 million patients from 2015, growing to 1.4 billion through 2050 is really, I think, pretty conservative in its assumption of the growth rate of populations and aging populations in lower growth areas. But what that shows is 1.4 billion available in that time, not including any impact from any of these GLP-1 class of drug. And we took really the maximum aggressive efforts, including all current indications and some future ones to assess what the impact could be on the potential of patients in terms of sleep apnea prevalence worldwide, really aggressive and assume not only aggressive penetration but sustained that the adherence rate would stay sort of 80% to 100% on these drugs, which they're not achieving out there in the market, but we just said, let's take that high penetration case and that showed 1.2 billion patients in 2050. And so we will look at every update that comes from the pharma industry. They're very active in this class of GLP-1 but we think we're taking a very high penetration analysis to get there. And so we'll continue to look at any new data that come on and every quarter, we'll update that epidemiology model and move it around. But what it shows is a huge opportunity, 1.1 billion patients above our penetration at quite high growth rates through the next number of decades. To your question around concomitant therapy and use what we've been seeing in the last two years since a number of these have been out there in the diabetes side and on the obese indications, it's obviously early days, but we're tracking many thousands of patients on GLP-1s and PAP and we're seeing maintenance of adherence, we're seeing maintenance of resupply programs and really no change. When you look at -- so that’s at the aggregate level, we are seeing no change there. We are seeing more patients coming into the funnel. Look, we know we're doing our awareness programs, our demand gen programs and there are other alternative therapies doing demand gen that bring patients into the funnel that we get a benefit from. But we truly believe that this idea that you could come in to the healthcare system, someone who's maybe obese, moderately obese and likely avoiding the healthcare system, there's a high avoidance of people with BMI of 30, 32, 35 of the primary care system. And so we believe it will bring more patients in. We're seeing that with our very high patient flow. So look, we're just looking at the data we're observing, which is patients on concomitant therapies there multiple years, and we're going to track those and track the adherence and we'll publish that every quarter. We're seeing actually our adherence rates steady and resupply rates steady in that installed base. And in the new patient flow side, we're actually seeing increased all-time highs of patients coming into the funnel. So we're watching all of these above and we're looking for two to three decades and still see with highest case penetration, you can roll in any study like you're still going to see north of hundreds of millions to 1 billion patients between the likely penetration in our disease state and beyond. But David, thanks for the question, and I look forward to ongoing discussions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan.
David Low: If I could stick on the same topic. Mick, could I get you to talk a little bit to the 22.5 million patients that you've got on myAir? It would be really good to understand how they sort of fit into the categories of mild, moderate and severe sleep apnea. Because as much as you've given us some very big numbers, we're fully aware that about half of those patients are in the mild category. And it's unclear to me that many of those patients are currently seeking treatment or will seek treatment in future. So if you could just help us with what you can see in the data and so we can make an assessment as well, please.
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, look, thanks for the question. And as you look at the epidemiology data, there's a number of splits on AHI. What we're lacking in the market is a split around symptomatology and how patients feel. And as we're looking at the data, patients with AHIs, 5 to 15, 15 to 30 and 30 plus and overlapping that with concomitant therapy, we'll be peer reviewing and publishing data at upcoming conferences in 2024 on this to show some of these nuances of deltas. But on the aggregate group, we're not seeing changes in adherence. And even in the subsets of mild to moderate, we're not seeing significant changes in adherence rates or new patients coming into the funnel. AHI is a great measure of the number of suffocation episodes per hour. Just to remind people, an AHI 14, just under 15, which is considered mild is suffocating every four minutes of sleep. So a doctor may call that mild, but to a patient who's suffocating every four minutes of sleep, in 15 -- 14 times an hour, and you're sleeping all through the not having 80, 90 suffocation episodes, they stick on the therapy and new patients coming in as well. So look, we're watching this really carefully, and we're really analyzing by AHI, by symptomatology, by craniofacial distance between the tongue and the uvula and actually size of time because there's a whole lot of factors that go into go into the prevalence of sleep apnea and obviously, the issues around hypopneas, which are far more prevalent in women and lead to worse excessive daytime sleepiness, headache and comorbidities that are not associated with weight at all. But look, we're looking through all of these data. And as we look forward over the next number of decades, there will be an impact. There's no question by these weight loss medications. But it will be on the margin and it won't be -- I mean, certainly, the market believes it's going to be dramatic given the last 90 days of our stock. And I can tell you, every bit of clinical data that we have going forward and every bit we have going retrospectively, we've got the biggest database in the world and it's 21.5 million patients. As we look at that split between mild, moderate and severe, we're not seeing changes. But look, every quarter, we'll continue to update that, and we'll do more and more splits on severity. We published this epidemiology model this quarter and we'll continue to update it and continue to provide data. I'm also making sure that we keep some of those data so we can get them into the peer reviewed and published press like the Lancet article that started the epidemiology model, and so we'll be publishing the information that we can. And then every quarter here on the -- on our investor site, but they will also be running the real sites in epidemiology models and health econ and outcomes research work and making sure that gets into the peer reviewed and published press as well.
Operator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST.
Dan Hurren: I was going to ask some questions about the results rather than GLP-1 drugs, if that's okay?
Mick Farrell: Dan, that would be delightful.
Dan Hurren: Look, just a question for Brett. Could you walk us -- can you just walk us through the headwinds and tailwinds for gross margin over the balance of FY24. And maybe we're seeing some pricing increases out there in the market and product mix shifting around. Could you just perhaps walk through those factors?
Brett Sandercock: As we look forward on GM, I mean, Mick mentioned it in his remarks as well. But if you look at it in terms of GM, we do feel that we're going to see improvements in our gross margin over FY24. And those tailwinds are really going to be around improved product mix, manufacturing improvements and efficiencies that we think we can drive. Freight cost reductions are still making their way through inventory and some of that will manifest in FY24. We're seeing stabilized component costs now, that was a headwind even for this quarter but we're cycling, largely cycling that, particularly in the second half FY '24. And then we have, obviously, the AS10 to AS11 transition that will be progressive over FY24 as well and then your point mentioning a little bit around pricing as well. So a combination of those factors will give us confidence, I think, in the gross margin through FY24.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.
Chris Cooper: Sorry come back to it, guys, but I think it is an important topic. So just on the patient data mix that you're tracking CPAP patients also in GLP-1s. Can you just update us on how many patients you're tracking there, and when you intend on publishing that? I know Rob foreshadowed last month that you would be sort of releasing that data? Would it make sense to do that before, or do you think maybe after the major study that's going to read out next year? And just any high level thoughts you have on the outcome of that study would be helpful at this stage.
Mick Farrell: And so yes, there will be ongoing longitudinal studies that will get out to the peer-reviewed press, but obviously, look, it's an urgent issue. And if you look at the market reaction the last 90 days, there's an assumption of 30%, 40% reduction in immediate TAM, right? If you look at that market cap change and it's just in congress with every piece of scientific evidence that we've looked at historically and going forward. So there's many thousands of patients on our GLP-1 plus PAP database. We also have 17,000 patients that we're tracking that have had gone through bariatric surgery and are on PAP therapy post surgery with 50%-plus weight loss reductions in that cohort. So we're tracking much stronger weight loss cohort and this sort of -- depending on which type of GLP-1, 10, 20, 30, plus percent weight loss reductions in the extreme case of the 50% weight loss reductions. And so we'll be are publishing data in the peer reviewed and clinical press across all of those cohorts as we go forward. Yes, we will choose -- as we keep putting out the epidemiology data, we will choose to put some of those data, which aren't going into the peer-reviewed press, right? So we don't those studies that we actually want to get into the clinical information that can really be out there versus just the stuff that we put together for an investor, which then would prohibit those same data going into a clinical paper. But we are finding the balance between those and we definitely hear that the market is looking for those data. I can tell you now that the data on aggregate are showing no change despite how you look which GLP-1 class, which AHI group for adherence and resupply. But I will start to find the right division between the information we can get out on the short to medium term basis and the information that needs to go in those longitudinal studies to really show the sites behind this and really balance it out. One of the best ways we're doing it every quarter is to show the incredible growth that we're getting in our devices and our masks and particularly the resupply of masks, right? There's no impact of anyone's recall, there's no impact of any drug therapy and you just look at the replenishment rate of masks, if you're not on therapy, you're not ordering masks. And we're seeing really strong resupply. The other fact to bring into this that we can publish and do publish is the number of patients in our Air Solutions ecosystem, 22.5 million patients that continues to go up. We had record numbers of new patients starting up. And in addition to that record numbers of patients themselves engaging with myAir and that's driven by AirSense 11 being far more digitally engaged and higher rates of adoption of that. But we're seeing a really strong uptake of patients and flow in and patients on adherence, but we'll continue to publish every quarter those data and the appropriate data we can from the clinical, and we'll definitely update the epidemiology model every quarter.
Operator: Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC.
Craig Wong-Pan: Just on your Americas mask growth, could you provide some more details on where that additional growth in resupply has been coming from, and how long do you think you can sustain that strong year-on-year growth in mask revenues?
Mick Farrell: It's a really good question because the mask growth across the group was 21% on constant currency. Europe was incredibly strong at 15% constant currency growth in a full competition market with everybody on the field and 23% in US, Canada, Latin America. Look, as I said in my description in the prepared remarks on our look forward over the next n number of decades, the stable market growth in our field was mid single digits on the device side and high single digits on the mask side. If you look at the five year CAGR, three year CAGR leading into 2019 pre COVID. And that's sort of what we're looking at that epidemiology model that mid single digit growth on devices and high single digit growth on masks. So if you think of that as the market growth in a stable state, it then comes up to, well, what can ResMed do in market demand? What can we do in demand gen? What can we do to get patients into the funnel? I truly believe to the three questions focused on this new class of drugs. I do believe we are seeing more patients come into the funnel, more patients into primary care. That's great. I mean I think there's $1 trillion worth of market cap now from these companies and they will turn that into marketing to bring people in for the miracle drug, and that will absolutely bring patients in for assessment for all the comorbidities that are associated with a patient that might have been severely overweight and now likely on the other side of these will still be overweight, including sleep apnea, COPD and other cardiovascular diseases and beyond. So we're watching that really closely. Look, we've consistently over decades that we've been in business, not just accepted mask growth rates from the market, we said, let's drive it higher and higher. The 23% is extraordinary and very strong in a highly competitive market. But I look at what we're doing with resupply, I look at what we're doing with new product launches, I look at what we're doing to drive patients into the funnel. And I think we can meet and beat that high single digits that the market would grow at. And with us being such a strong share, we get to -- when we do demand gen, we get to get a very good share of those patients through the funnel. So there's more of an incentive for ResMed to drive demand gen initiatives when we get such a good share of it on the device and mask side, and we're seeing that in many of the markets we operate in worldwide. But it's a great question.
Operator: Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley.
Sean Laaman: Mick, really good OpEx control in the quarter. And I think Brett mentioned, if I pick it up correctly, 18% to 20% as a guide on revenue going forward. I'm just wondering if there is more restructuring to done or to be done or you think you're rightsized at the moment?
Mick Farrell: And as I said in the prepared remarks, stuff that impacts our people are the toughest decisions to make, and we did this week, have a change in 5% of our global workforce reduction of 5% of our global workforce and tough decisions to make. I really think that, that is -- if you think about it, that is the restructuring. There are some changes I'm looking at it in the operating model, sort and roles and responsibilities and a focus on a more product-led and brand-led company that will come over time, but they're not massive restructures. And I think what that 18% to 20% revenues that Brett talked about in SG&A is indicative of the change that we've made here and reestablished a new base and a push for, as you said, really strong profitable growth across our business. But look, the world has changed. We are already a product led organization but our brand has increased in its value across the world, and we need to document and understand that and understand how to engage people in nonreimbursed markets as consumers into the funnel. And we've already invested in a number of our D2C markets in that, and we're driving that. And in our B2B and B2B2C markets, we're also working with our healthcare partners and distributors in the channel to work out how to best get patients into the funnel. So we're sort of, if you like, we're freeing up cash to reinvest in demand gen, reinvest in getting patients into the funnel. And we think there's a billion reasons in terms of the patients that need our help to get out there and do it. And that's going to be there for decades and we've got to find better ways to do it. But to answer your question directly, yes, that restructure is done and we're now focused on moving forward.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Margarette Kaczor from William Blair.
Margarette Kaczor: I wanted to focus on the quarter as well. You guys talked about this all time high patient flow number, which is notable. When you said the channel, I guess, were you referencing those are CPAP prescriptions or folks getting tests? And any color you can give us on how that growth profile compared to recent quarters, and anything kind of on the US device growth this quarter as well?
Mick Farrell: So look, we have a relatively low share of the diagnostic space in home sleep apnea testing with our ApneaLink Air product. So we are tracking that,those are up. The best data we have is through Air Solutions System. So we talk about the 22.5 million patients on our Air Solutions platform and almost 7 million patients that we now have on myAir patients directly engaged in. So we watch those starts very closely. We also do have de-identified and objective data from Brightree showing across the whole industry, patients coming into the funnel in sleep apnea but also across other home medical equipment categories. And I can tell you the patients are getting engaged and finding their way into the to the primary care treatment funnel and specifically in sleep apnea. And we believe it's not short term that this is a sustainable rate of growth for patients coming in, and I think it's really exciting to see that. To your question specifically about device growth, yes, so it's 8% globally. I mean I got to say I'm incredibly proud of our Europe, Asia and rest of world markets growing 20% this quarter year-on-year, that's where we're competing directly with our competitor that was out for their recall. They're back in many countries, in Europe, Asia and rest of world, and meeting and beating them head-to-head, I think, proves out the thesis that ResMed has the best-in-class products, but services and solutions, not just the hardware but the software and the capability we've been investing in that for a long period of time. This period a year ago, the September quarter 2022, we had just unleashed card to cloud on an unallocated basis, and it took off despite usually what is quite a low growth quarter in September, given that summer here in the US. We had incredible growth last summer with our card to cloud solutions, so we're lapping that growth. I think the team with that device growth of 2% is building on what was an extraordinary uptick from card to cloud. But when we look at the number of patients coming through, the diagnostic funnel and the setups coming into AirView and the setups of the patients coming into myAir, the growth rate of patients is mid single digits plus and with recap really up there. And so I think that's why I can say that I think it's sustainable for us to meet and beat sort of the pre-COVID 2019 earlier CAGR of mid single digit growth for devices, we can meet and beat that throughout demand gen and high single digit growth in masks. We can definitely meet and beat that through our work and experience and expertise now on resupply, engagement with patients and the changes that happen during COVID are focused on respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. So I hope that answers your question, Margaret. Thanks to that.
Operator: Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.
Steve Wheen: Just a question back on to the gross margin. When we think about fourth quarter's growth margin, it went down largely because of FX and mix and yet we've got that going in your favor in this quarter. I'm just curious as to really what is holding that gross margin back when you do have such a strong mix geographically with devices in rest of world up but also masks as a category overall up and you've got the FX tailwind as well? And just to clarify, the Astral field safety notice cost is not in the 56% gross margin from what I can work out, if that's correct as well?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, that's correct, that's excluded as a non-GAAP item from 56%. But if you're talking year-on-year on the gross margin, really the biggest impact coming through was component cost increases that we're still cycling through and working through inventory. So that was the biggest factor. We did see some product mix favorability there, but not enough to offset those component cost increases, for example. That was the biggest impact on the year-on-year reduction in GM.
Operator: Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital.
Saul Hadassin: Mick, you've kind of commented on sustainability of US flow gen growth. I just wanted to ask you, so the growth rate based on revenues this quarter implies about a 17% CAGR going back to 1Q fiscal '20, so the September '19 quarter. So I'm just wondering if you think you can sustain sort of the dollars of flow gen sales that you reported this quarter, or if you think sales are going to step down as we work through the rest of fiscal '24? Just wondering if you can sustain the level of sales in dollar terms?
Mick Farrell: It's a good question, but it's a complicated answer, because there's so many moving pieces between that baseline you took there for that CAGR number '19 and '20 with the COVID shutdowns, our spin-up on ventilators with 150,000 vents at the start 2020 and then the slowdown and the restart-up of the sleep apnea funnel and the shift that happened through 2020, 2021. And then, of course, the perturbation that made it a perfect storm of a competitor with a recall of 5.5 million devices and '21 through '23 and ongoing. So with all that, I'll just talk to the market growth rate that we saw stable pre-2019, right, of that mid single digit growth of devices and high single digit growth in masks. We think that where we're at now taking our baseline of now we can meet and beat that growth rate, right? And so that definitely doesn't mean going backwards. You can take what we've got now, which is, I believe, a very strong share of the US market and in the 140 countries we're in competition, but it's a good place for us to be. We are looking at from where we are achieving mid single digit plus growth in our devices and high single-digit growth on our masks. And no, we don't intend to go backwards at all. In fact, we intend to not only go forward but go forward strongly. And I think what was shown up in the numbers this quarter is our incredibly strong growth. I talked earlier that our incredibly strong growth in devices of 20% in Europe, Asia and rest of world. We had 15% growth in masks in Europe, Asia and around the other countries. And so I think what it's shown is that ResMed is going to go head-to-head with full competition out there and be able to meet and beat the competition, because we've got the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, most connected and the most intelligent health systems, and it's that whole combination of not just the product, but the solution, the service and how it's embedded in the healthcare system to the patient to the physician that allows us to achieve that. So we're not going backwards, we're going forward, Saul, and we're going to grow at or ahead of market. And in many countries, we're going to drive demand gen to increase the whole aggregate market growth rate and pull more patients into the funnel, because now we've got a greater incentive than ever to do that. Thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question is coming from Matthew Chevrier from Citi.
Matthew Chevrier: One on SaaS, please. So what will drive the SaaS revenue to now grow double digits from high single digit previously?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Matthew, and welcome to covering ResMed. Yes. So look, what's going to happen is with our organic SaaS business, as you saw in the quarter, we had good high single-digit growth at 7%. And we've sort of been in that sort of 7% to 8% in our organic growth across our US franchise really MatrixCare plus Brightree. And with the MEDIFOX DAN group, we haven't sort of been breaking out organic growth within that. But it is going to be incremental to that group. But in addition to that, there's a great product pipeline at both Brightree and MatrixCare that I feel confident and some portfolio focuses on the high growth parts of their portfolio and moving out or backing up with some of the low growth areas in that portfolio of MatrixCare that gives me great confidence as I look forward over the fiscal year and beyond that we're going to turn organic growth from sort of where it is now in the high single digits to double double digit growth on a stable organic basis across that SaaS business. So Matthew, it's a combination of MEDIFOX DAN increase in the group but also some great product pipelines in the current business to be able to get us there. And the final punchline I'll put there is, in addition to that, driving that better top line growth, we're working -- we restructured as well on SG&A and some R&D in our SaaS business this week, this quarter. And that will allow us to get good leverage on the net operating profit bottom line. And I see that moving closer and closer to the ResMed group and even being a strong contributor, an even stronger contributor for us as we look to maximize our long term EPS and return on invested capital across our group. So great question, Matthew, but we're very confident we can achieve that as we go through fiscal year '24, '25 and beyond in our SaaS business.
Operator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks, everybody, for attending this call and for the great detailed questions. And thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I'll close with this. ResMed is well positioned for ongoing future success and accelerated profitable growth. We're taking actions to prioritize on the right initiatives and we're optimizing costs to fuel our long term growth. The opportunity in front of us is huge and largely untapped and it's an incredible runway. We see more and more people coming into the healthcare system every quarter and we'll benefit and help them sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. And we'll keep proving it to you every quarter as we go forward. Thanks to all the 10,000 ResMed-ians, many of whom are also shareholders, for all that you do today and every day. And with that, I'll hand the call back to you, Amy, to close us out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. As always, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude ResMed's first quarter 2024 conference call. Kevin, you can now end the call.
Operator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-08-03 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you so much, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Lucile Blaise, President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care Business for the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. Please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported numbers. Our discussion today will also include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the Risk Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results of our June quarter, the last quarter of our fiscal year 2023. Our results reflect incredible growth across our entire business with double-digit growth in our devices, masks, and software businesses. Unconstrained availability of our market leading cloud connected flow generator platforms has enabled us to continue to offer access to 100% cloud connectable AirSense 10 flow generated devices in all of our major global markets and beyond. In parallel, we are ramping up and improving the availability of our best-in-class AirSense 11 platform, which will gain further geographic regulatory approvals throughout the fiscal year and steadily increasing supply also throughout the fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Although challenges within the post-COVID supply chain haven't completely been mitigated yet, we expect ongoing steady improvement in component and end product supply in the quarters ahead using a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms. While we remain focused on scaling production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform, we remain on allocation for the Air 11 platform for the next few quarters. But I want to be clear on this point. With combined availability of the unconstrained Air 10 platform, we have enough devices to meet all of the customer needs that we see in major markets and globally. With the powerful combination of the Air 10 and the Air 11 platforms, we have the two best device platforms on the market. Our strong double-digit 23% year-over-year growth in the devices category demonstrates that customers are choosing ResMed and we are delivering. Our masks and accessories business also performed at a very strong 18% growth in constant currency this quarter. Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these strong growth results amid a challenging industry environment where component costs and freight costs are still working their way through our inventory post this supply chain crisis. I'm proud of the work that 10,000 ResMedians have put in every week, every month, every quarter to deliver these incredible results for the business, for our customers, for our shareholders, and ultimately for our most important customer, our patients. Let's now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business; number two, to design, develop, and deliver market leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to create, innovate, and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, a field that we call residential medicine. In terms of our patient facing digital health platforms, adoption continues to go very well. The feedback we hear from patients and healthcare professionals remains very positive. We are seeing strong adoption of the myAir patient app by folks using AirSense 11. In fact, it is more than double the adoption rate that we saw with our AirSense 10 platform with many, many millions of patients signing up and engaging daily on their myAir app to view their own sleep data on their own phone and to review their own therapy data. This is important as engagement with a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to higher adherence to therapy in patients. And higher adherence to therapy is directly related to better patient outcomes, to increased resupply and to better economics for the payer and the healthcare provider with lower overall healthcare costs. Last month, we announced and closed the acquisition of Somnoware. Somnoware is a U.S.-based leader in sleep and respiratory care diagnostics software and physician management software. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve and streamline the end-to-end pathway for patients and make it easier for sleep labs and physicians and their practices to diagnose and manage patients, we're excited about this acquisition that complements our current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers. These ecosystem together will drive greater efficiency and better patient care by accelerating the pathway to therapy and with a better overall customer experience. We're also excited about our progress across several digital health technology initiatives to further increase the value proposition for our connected healthcare ecosystem. Over the next several quarters, we plan to introduce several artificial intelligence driven data products and capabilities on both the physician and provider facing AirView platform, as well as the patient facing myAir app. Early testing of these AI driven data products is very positive in both of these customer groups, and we will refine to the optimal digital design and then we will launch and then we will scale these products around the world. These AI driven data products provide personalized suggestions to increase therapy adherence and to ultimately improve patient outcomes as well as patient, physician, and provider experience. We will continue to invest in the world's largest digital healthcare ecosystem that we have with over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud as we continue to unlock value from those data to benefit physicians, providers, payers, and patients. We saw strong growth in our respiratory care business in the quarter through ongoing adoption of our non-invasive ventilators as well as our life support ventilator solutions. We're still in the early stages of market development with some of our newer to market technologies in this category, including home-based high-flow therapy that we call HFT for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD in the home. We continue to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease in the home. We're encouraged by the clinical results we've seen with our HFT trials so far, and we continue to remain very focused on addressing COPD as one of the top diseases globally for hospitalization and the number one cause of re-hospitalization in the U.S. geography. The prevalence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD as well as respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease continues to increase and we are focused on having low cost, high quality solutions to address this health epidemic. Our SaaS business had another great quarter with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our SaaS business growth was supported by another full quarter contribution from our fast growing MEDIFOX DAN business, as well as solid organic growth of 8% across our Brightree and MatrixCare portfolio of SaaS businesses. We're pleased to see sustained high-single-digit growth in our SaaS business on an organic basis, driven by the ongoing strength in the HME and infusion segment, and more stability in the facility segment as patient flows have now rebounded post-COVID. I'm very impressed by the leadership of our most recent SaaS portfolio addition MEDIFOX DAN, which is on track and meeting or beating our expectations. I'll be visiting personally with the team in Hildesheim, Germany, this quarter to discuss the growth face-to-face with the digital health innovators there in Hildesheim who are changing healthcare and taking care of people in the lowest cost, lowest acuity and highest quality of life setting, which is very often the home. We believe this is the future of healthcare and that's where we're investing and that's where we're winning. Our customers continue to see the value of adopting technologies to improve and optimize business efficiencies and personalized care, and we deliver the best software solutions to help customers do just that. There is pent-up demand for technology investments in residential medicine verticals, particularly as staffing shortages continue to impact the industry, particularly in nursing, but across the clinician and provider groups. This presents opportunities for ResMed's SaaS solutions to streamline operations and create workflow efficiencies so our customers, staff can focus on providing personal care. It's up to us to deliver for our customers and drive growth. I have confidence that our SaaS business can accelerate from these high-single-digits on an organic basis to double-digit growth on an organic basis in the mid to long-term. Our SaaS business remains an integral part of ResMed's growth strategy. This business complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. As an important example, our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate strong synergies between SaaS and our core business, providing resupply for patients with sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. The output of this work can be seen in our very healthy 19% growth in mass revenues in the U.S. geography this quarter. Ultimately, this work results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer with lower overall healthcare costs. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for residential medicine globally. We have created differentiated value for our customers as well as long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Here at ResMed, we are transforming respiratory medicine and residential medicine at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our businesses. As we continue to scale and drive efficiencies in our operations in this post-COVID world, we continue to leverage appropriate pricing and cost reductions to drive accelerated growth in our bottom line. We are focused on driving top-line revenue and maintaining tight discipline and increasing efficiencies so that we can lower costs and ultimately so that we can accelerate our impact and our bottom line profitability, delivering even further value for all of our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, I see improvements in our business margins with geography mix, with product mix, and specifically with strong bi-level and non-invasive ventilator growth with strong mass growth and with increased software solutions growth. All these business lines are margin accretive to our growth. I also see that the higher inventory costs and freight costs that we've seen through the supply chain crisis continue to work their way through our sold products and as we progress through the fiscal year, we will continue to drive the transition to AirSense 11 and we will gain regulatory approvals and we will scale production. All these factors above lead to tailwinds for the gross margin and the net margin of our business as we move through the fiscal year. I can tell you we are working furiously to drive all of the above elements with our global teams. We now have over 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud, as I said earlier, and those data come from over 21.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to lead the industry in digital health and we don't plan to stop anytime soon because there's so much opportunity ahead of us. 7% of our revenues go straight into R&D to power our hardware and our data innovation engines. ResMed's mission and key goal remains crystal clear. We will improve 250 million lives through better residential healthcare in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last 90 days and during the trailing 12 months, we have improved over 160 million lives with the delivery of a complete device platform to a patient or a complete mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that is helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live a high quality life with healthcare delivered right where they live. As we start fiscal year 2024 here, I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We just had our SaaS ASM earlier this week, and I'll be attending the Country Market Group CMG Group for our North America team in the coming weeks. And sales meetings are happening around the world. We're on a good trajectory. We have an exciting pipeline. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication both today and every day. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move and open up for Q&A for the group. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q4. Group revenue for the June quarter was $1.12 billion, an increase of 23% on a headline basis and in constant currency terms. Revenue growth reflected the ongoing combined availability of cloud connected AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted revenue by approximately $3 million in the June quarter. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 25%. In constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 14%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 24% while masks and other sales increased by 18%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America increased by 30% as we benefited from strong demand. And as previously mentioned, our continued ability to fully supply the market with combined availability of AS 10 and AS 11 cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 19%, reflecting growth in resupply and new patient setups. Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of cloud connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 34% in the June quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and continued strong performance from our HME vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 8% in the June quarter. MEDIFOX DAN contributed revenue of $27.3 million for the June quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 points to 55.8% in the June quarter. The decrease primarily reflects component cost increases; warranty and manufacturing related cost increases and product mix shifts due to the significant increase in sleep device sales partially offset by increases in average selling prices  On a sequential basis, unfavorable foreign currency movements accounted for the 30 basis points decline in our gross margin and we saw a lower than expected product mix benefit as we continue to see strong growth in sleep devices in the U.S. market. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 25%, or in constant currency terms increased by 26%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs marketing and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expenses associated with MEDIFOX DAN that we acquired in November 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 21.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year 2024. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 21% or in constant currency terms increased by 23%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% during fiscal year 2024. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 13% underpinned by strong revenue growth partially offset by lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense for the quarter is $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount per quarter in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 17.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the June quarter increased by 7% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 7%. During the quarter, we incurred $1.8 million in acquisition expenses associated with our Somnoware acquisition, and we recognized restructuring costs of $9.2 million associated with the closure of the Aria lymphedema business and workforce rationalization in our German and SaaS business verticals. We also recognized a gain of $20.2 million within our income in relation to a business interruption insurance claim. These have all been treated as non-GAAP items in our Q4 financial results. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $237 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $47 million. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. At June 30, we had $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt, which mainly reflects the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our debt by $145 million. At June 30, we had approximately $745 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility, and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing an increase of 9% over our previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and expect to deploy further capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as our recently announced acquisition of Somnoware, a company that provides an upstream diagnostic management platform that is complementary to our current AirView and Brightree solutions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett, and thank you, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey Mick, with the devices number sort of steady sequentially around this $600 million mark, is this where the number would kind of base out if you are supplying the majority of the market? And from here, are we looking at just saying $600 million and then add on some percentage of what the underlying fleet market is kind of growing at?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. And it's a good one. It's hard to predict because there are so many factors involved that that are going on in the market right now. But yes, as you said, a very, very solid number, $602 million in global devices in the quarter and 30% growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 15% growth in Europe, Asia, and rest of world. Look, we're seeing a strong sort of mid-single-digits level of patient flow into the channel. We're seeing in addition to that -- like in terms of new patients, we're seeing in addition to that resupply of patients at that five-year point for most U.S. reimbursement and various points in the other 139 countries where people make their own decisions or insurance has other criteria to drive that. So it's new patient setups, it's resupply setups and there's of course the impact of a competitor recall, which is -- was supposed to be over in June 30 and now has no definitive date. And so as we look to that with all those unknown factors, it's very hard for me to say, Matthew, that it's just stop and steady growth from here. It might be stronger growth from here. And that makes it hard to predict gross margins because as we grow those CPAP and APAP numbers so well in the U.S. geography, it's incredible great revenue and cloud connected and links us with the patient for life, but it is lower gross margin than our group. And so it's great gross profit dollars, but has an impact on our gross margin as you saw that steady apart from FX moving it down 30 basis points. So a complex equation but I'd say it's at minimum, it stays where it is and grows with the market but it could potentially grow above that as we continue to take share and solidify that share through our digital ecosystem. Thanks for the question, Matthew.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up first on the competitive dynamic to the extent that you'll -- you see anything maybe into the -- in the marketplace. So whether your key competitor is coming back either approaching or maybe hiring processes, marketing campaigns, anything that maybe they're gearing up for that you're seeing or is demand relatively similar to what you've seen in the past, no real changes. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Margaret, and welcome back. Yes. I think it's difficult to predict exactly where they're at from those sort of the early emerging signs, as you say. Look, we have regional competitors in Europe that we are fighting with every day there. We have regional competitors in Asia that we're fighting with every day and regional competitors in the Americas that we're fighting with every day. When Philips comes back, they'll have to start at position number four, if you like, in new patient setups. We are -- they are back and we are competing with them in some countries in Europe, like in Spain, they never went away because they never had a phone device there. So they've been there the whole time through this recall, and we've been beating them handsomely there. And as other markets in Europe where they've started to come back, we are competing and winning and maintaining share and growing share. I think the reputation here and the time to market is going to be a very slow progress for them country by country whether or not they get a consent decree in the largest geography. And so we look at it going forward and say, look, do we have enough supply to take care of all the market demands between us and the other regional players? And we finally got there where I can say that this quarter that we're there and we can take care of it. So it's almost irrelevant to us how and when in terms of what that looks like because we're able to take care of all the market growth. So for us, it sort of takes away that uncertainty and allows us to push forward. But yes, we're competing head-to-head with them in some many countries in Asia and some countries in Europe. And it's like -- it wasn't 2019 where our smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more digital solutions are taking share and holding share. And it's an ongoing competitive game. And as I said, we're launching some of these AI driven products on top of this ecosystem. It's an exponential game when you think about digital and we're well ahead. We've had two or three years here to sprint ahead. We were ahead before that. And I think it's a long-term game won't get -- we'll keep productively paranoid, but we are improving outcomes, we're lowering costs and the physicians like the workflow efficiencies and patients like the increased adherence and payers like the fact that there's an ROI in lowering total healthcare costs.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Anthony Petrone from Mizuho Group. Your line is now live.
Anthony Petrone: Great. Thank you. Congrats on a shrunk top-line here, share gains. Maybe two part question. Mick, one would be just on the amount of resupply that's now coming in as it relates to the share gains that you've seen over the past two years, is the resupply number we're seeing now where we actually starting to see consumables come off of the new sockets that you gained. So that would be question one. And then question two, there's obviously the debate out there on GLP-1s, maybe from the perspective of ResMed, how do you see the GLP-1 phenomenon playing out in the sleep space, specifically do you expect to gain more patients from GLP-1s versus maybe certain patients that would fall out of the funnel? Thanks again.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Anthony, and welcome back to you too to the ResMed following us here. I'll take yes, both of your question and your follow-up in order. So firstly on resupply, as you know, you've been following us for a number of years. It's not a lock and key. You can use our mask on other devices and you can use other masks on our devices. The way that we've won market share and nobody's been on a major in terms of not being able to sell recall out there on this. And so we've had head-to-head competition with all the top five players in masks, these last three years and we've gained really good share with that. So I think it's just the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the minimalist size ones, the ones that have full freedom and the ones that have the ability to for the front sleepers and side sleepers to provide that, that capability. And so that's how we've gained share in the mask side and maintained that share. So I -- there is a better together in that when you have an AirSense 10 or an AirSense 11, the mask leak data are more accurate. The interoperability of an AHI calculation or a leak calculation are more accurate. So we certainly push that angle and we do get some extra share for through the device, but it's not as material as the fact that the masks themselves are just excellent, which I think speaks to the sustainability there. So that strong resupply, as you said, 19% growth in the U.S., 14% growth in Europe, Asia and beyond, where we don't have that sort of automated resupply that we have with Brightree ReSupply Solutions in the U.S. that's been from hard work from our teams in Asia, Latin America, and Europe on patient outreach, subscription programs and connecting directly to that end user. So I think post-COVID people care about respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and taking care of themselves outside the hospital, and we've been able to leverage that trend in the consumer side as well. So I think it's sustainable, and I don't think although it may be catalyzed somewhat by our increased device share, I think our market share is on its own extraordinary and due to the intrinsic products. The second question around GLPs, yes, look, there's a lot of moving parts. I was just reading in the press today that many U.S. employers are banning coverage of GLP-1s due to cost. European governments have all said no from the government insurance side. These things are incredibly expensive about $1,000, well, anywhere from $800 to $1,200, $1,000 a month. So I think there are three factors that'll mitigate GLPs in the space. One is cost, two is adherence, and three is side effects. I'll take them really quickly in order. If you look at cost, take a 40-year old person who's on therapy full time for 40 years, 40 times, 12 times a $1,000 is $480,000 lifetime cost for that patient on a GLP-1 from 40 to 80 lifetime cost. If you take that same patient and say, look, let's treat them with CPAP, right? First year maybe a $1,000, and then 39 years of let's take a really strong case where you get four masks a year and they're all full face masks. That's about thirteen and a half thousand dollars. So it's 35 times more expensive to go with a GLP-1. It's just like what's the ROI here, that's cost. On adherence, the data out there are about 33% adherence at one year through the clinical trials on GLP-1s. That's incredibly low. We get 87% adherence at 90 days, and we hold it pretty strong there. So I think adherence is a big deal. And third is side effects. Reading thyroid, pancreas, kidney, these cancer, these major side effects and minor ones like nausea, constipation, and pain. Our biggest side effect as President Biden had a little mark on his face and he was asked about it, and it was from his CPAP. Look, I think it's a long road to play out here. I think it's frankly good marketing around the area of obesity and it can drive patients into the funnel. But I don't think it's going to be a major impact on patients because we've got 936 million of them worldwide and we need them to get into the funnel. If they come in the funnel because they tried a pill and it didn't work. That's good for us too.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Shaymus Contorno: Hi, this is Shaymus on for Suraj. So we saw gross margin set down a little bit. I know you said there was some reasonings for it, but I just looking forward kind of in the future, maybe you can walk us through the temporary and more structurally permanent changes we should think through as far as GM outlook is concerned.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question and you look and it's a good one. Lots of factors going on gross margin, actually, the major one that as you noticed sequentially on the 30 basis points was foreign exchange and that was on inventory as it flowed through our funnel as we sold those CPAPs, APAPs we had, FX that had impacted them, six, nine months ago, but they're flowing through inventory that we sold during the June quarter. That was the headwind of 30 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We -- look, I think there's so many moving parts, but when you add it up and you look at geography mix and the upside opportunity for us to grow our business in Europe, Asia, particularly Japan, which has some chance for acceleration over the coming years, product mix, I mentioned in the prep remarks, particularly on bi-level and our non-invasive ventilator growth. So think AirCurve ST, FTI, AirCurve ASV, these are in -- and our masks side, particularly the full face, but any of the masks, all of those are gross margin accretive to our group. And I see opportunities for strong growth in all those categories. And also our software solutions have gross margin accretive capabilities and as we go on an organic basis from single-digits to high-single-digits to low doubles there on the software SaaS side of the business, I think that's margin accretive. So I feel good about that. I also know that we are working through the sort of higher inventory costs that we had in that supply chain crisis, we had to spend more on chips, parts and pieces and those contracts and get more expensive components for the cloud connective chip and beyond. And those freight costs that we invested in and everyone's talking all the news, the freight costs are down, you should take away your surcharge. Well, no, actually the freight costs that we paid six, nine months ago are working there with through -- way through our gross margin, as you saw in the June quarter. And that'll go on for some time, but that's going to continue to go down over time and as that does go through our sole products, there's going to be some tailwinds for gross margin. And the final one and really important one is we're going to drive AirSense 11. It's the best in the world product. It's better than the second best product in the world, which is the AirSense 10. And it gives us a chance as we gain regulatory approvals and we scale that production to improve our gross margins there as well. So all those are tailwinds for the gross and net margin of the business as we move through the fiscal year. Hard to predict in that one of the main factors is, how do we accelerate in the U.S. and particularly in CPAP, APAP. I will never turn down a patient if there's demand for a patient and they want an CPAP and APAP, I'm not going to reverse engineer and we know how to do it. We could reverse engineer our gross margin up 30, 50 basis points by slowing down sales of product. We're not going to do that when a patient needs care. We're going to take care of them even if it's a slightly lower gross margin. And by the way, it is very good gross profit dollars, and we get to take that cash flow as you saw a really strong cash flow in the quarter and reinvest it in R&D. So we're working on all the above furiously and we're going to get success as we go over the next one, two, three, and four quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Laura Sutcliffe from UBS. Your line is now live.
Laura Sutcliffe: Hello, thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk about how your position to increase your mask supply in the event that the consent decree over at the competition impacts their ability to provide those, for example, if they end up constrained at a facility level. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look, we have run all sorts of scenario analyses around that. I think one of the differences if you think in terms of ResMed's ability to work with suppliers in the core device side, where in terms of chip sets, the whole med-tech sector as a group, and I serve on the Board of AdvaMed and we were advocating for more semiconductor chips for the whole industry. When we were going to Intel, TI and all these companies and sort of begging for semiconductor chips 12, 18 months ago, all together we were less than 1% of the supply of chips. And it was very difficult. We did get some, and as you saw, we did have to pay a little more, but we were able to get those contracts with other players and get long-term contracts and get that supply. In the field of medical grade silicon rubber, we are one of the top users in the world for this. As you know, we sell tens of millions of mask products per year. And we are an incredibly large part of that supply chain. So if a competitor was not able to sell masks, their demand for that LSR would go down and those or similar suppliers would then want to keep their factories operating and be looking for other suppliers. And we would be running the game theory and the analysis of where we go and how we go to ramp that production up. So it would be a good problem to have for the business. I think it'd be bad problem to have for patients, but I think the probability of that is relatively low, but if it does happen, we're ready. But Rob, do you have any thoughts on that? Rob Douglas, our President and COO.
Rob Douglas: Yes. Hi, just one other minor comment on that. And we've said this before, because of the relatively low CapEx of our supply chain and the equipment that we need, we generally run with quite a lot of those capacity supply. And so our ability to rapidly increase volumes as needed is really strong.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Sean Laaman: Good afternoon. Mick, hope you're well. Mick, I'm wondering if you could characterize for us some of the price dynamics that might have been present during the quarter.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. Yes, a simple question, very complex answer across the 140 countries and all the dynamics. I think one thing that I'm comfortable to say though on this is that if you look over the last four quarters, our commercial teams have done an incredible job of partnering up with our customers to say, look, inflation is up, costs are up. How do we share some of the pain, if you like, of these increased costs? And we were able to increase some prices on some mask systems and components and some devices where we could, it's tough because customers often don't get much relief from the payers. They did in the Medicare side in the U.S. market where there was an inflation adjustment up of around 5% January 1. And so that was a benefit for our providers, and so we could share some of the pain there in terms of increased pricing. But we've also had some surcharges on our products in terms of freight. And although, as I said in the prep remarks, we've seen all the news media that freight costs are all down. Well, yes, okay, they are on a spot price, but 12 months ago or nine months ago, as that works through our inventory, that freight charge is still there and is still impacting our costs. And inflation, although coming down is still high. But I think our commercial teams have done a really good job of partnering up with our customers, walking them through the situation, the reality that costs are up, inflation's up, freights up, inventory costs are up. We need to work on appropriate pricing to make that happen. And we've had some appreciation in average selling price over these last 12 months. And we'll look to do over the next 12 months to do an appropriate pricing with customers on a per customer per contract basis to sort of share some of the pain of the increased cost that our industry is having. But at the same time, we're laser-focused on driving that growth. And so it's a really strong sort of price elasticity, it's a question of how do we make sure we get that balance right? But it's a competitive game. Some of our competitors are out there saying the same thing publicly, that costs are up. And so we need to move prices appropriately. And we are out there working with customers to make sure that we as an industry take care of patients in a sustainable economic way, and that that involves both quantity, price, and supply over the long-term.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Yes. Good morning, Mick. Can I ask a question about outlook? So through the earlier -- early quarters you mentioned that we were going to see sequential revenue growth through 2023, and we have seen that, and that's been fabulous. But with your competitor -- key competitor out of the market, do you still expect to grow revenue sequentially into first quarter, second quarter 2024 or for however long as they remain out of the market?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So great question, Lyanne. And yes, 12 months ago, when it was pretty clear that we had a strong runway there on the devices side, and we -- it was really, we were constrained by our own production. I was able to very strongly say, look, I am confident that our supply chain team has got access to this re-engineering, redesign, and redeployment of key components, particularly electronic components, particularly semiconductors. And we did that and we grew device revenue every quarter throughout fiscal year 2023, as you noted. I was really excited with the team on that. As we look forward to fiscal year 2024, we don't give guidance really on the top-line. Brett's given some really solid guidance on our SG&A, our R&D, our effective tax rate and how we're looking in those parts of the business that are very controllable. As I said in some of the earlier questions, Lyanne, there's so many moving factors in overall demand in the market. But look, I'm confident because new patients continue to come into the funnel, right? That's happening across the world, and it's not happening randomly. We're driving demand gen programs; we're driving them in Australia, New Zealand with our Awaken Your Best campaign. We're driving them through our German teams, our India teams, social media programs in our China team, this really strong social media demand gen. And so we're getting new patients in the funnel. And there was a lot of patients who couldn't get a replenishment device when their device hit three years or five years or whatever time their insurance allows, or they as a consumer decide that they want to get to the next-gen product. And I think the AirSense 11 and all its features, it's engagement with the patient, with compliance coach, and its ability to engage with them directly on the touchscreen has driven some demand as well. So all that together make me confident that over the fiscal year, we're going to have strong demand. But as you go from Q4 to Q1, there's a seasonal impact. The Northern European and U.S. markets take summer vacations, and these have impacts seasonally on the business. And so traditionally, Q4 to Q1 isn't one up. I'm not giving guidance for it, but traditionally, that's the way it happens. We are not -- we are no longer supply constrained. We are back to a demand environment. And then there's the factor of that number four competitor probably not coming back during the next 60 days through. So the end of this 90-day period, but I'm not going to jump in and predict on that. All I'm going to say is we're out there all day every day, driving demand gen of new patients in, we're out there farming for patients who need to get a replacement device. And every day we're engaging with patients on myAir and reminding them of the importance of a clean hygiene and a new mask and engagement with their digital apps. So all the above gives me very strong confidence for high growth of ResMed throughout the year. But I'm not going to call it on an every 90 day basis here. We just don't do that on the top-line.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Cooper: Good morning -- afternoon. Thank you. So Mick on AirSense 11, you sort of emphasized its importance for gross margin. You also said at the start of the call, you sort of expect this to remain on allocation for a few more quarters yet, I know this timeframe was probably a bit longer than you'd hoped. I just wanted to confirm whether that's entirely a function of supply chain at this point, or I guess whether there's any sort of strategic consideration to manage volumes during such an unusual competitive dynamic.
Mick Farrell: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. We've really been focused on that patient and making sure no one's left behind. As I said in an earlier question, and although the AirSense 11 is better margin for us, and it's better innovation and it has a higher engagement on the myAir app, which drives engagement, adherence, mass resupply and everything. Our view is that if there's a patient available and we have the parts and pieces and the ability to make an AirSense 10 take care of that demand now while we ramp AirSense 11, we're going to do it and we're going to take care of that patient. By the way, there's some really strong upside for that patient in that the alternative is a competitor device, which would not be as small, quite, comfortable and connected. And so they'd have a much worse experience than the AirSense 10 with a competitive one. So it's better for the patient. It is slightly low margin for us, but we get that patient on therapy, and there is the better together with ResMed that it's more likely, hopefully, that they get a ResMed mask and that they use that mask for the rest of their life. And so I think there's an overlap there, if you like of altruism and the profit motive to do the right thing on a gross profit, cash flow driven environment. And we're not going to manage just to a GM line and say, well, let's not do that and make those products. And so it's less I mean, it's strategic in this way that our brand is about patient care. Our brand is about taking care of someone who's suffocating and getting them out of hospital and doing that. And if we have to do it with an AirSense 10, which is an amazing seven-year old platform, then we're going to do it. If we can do it with the brand new AirSense 11 platform, we're going to do it. And look, nothing's slowing us down. Our quality and regulatory teams are going geography by geography to get the AirSense 11 approved in each of the regulatory environments. So as soon as that is, we can start selling the products. But the ramp up on AirSense 11 is probably not as fast as it would be in a market where you had all five major competitors competing there because of that excess demand we're covering a lot of that with the AirSense 10. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Patient-centric, patient demand, take care of that patient now, get them on our ecosystem, and then ramp as fast as we can AirSense 11, and we're doing that. Nothing's slowing down. The accelerator is firmly pedal to the floor on AirSense 11. And so everyone we make, we sell but it will be on allocation just given the huge demand that we see in the market right now, Chris. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Hi, good morning, and thanks very much. Mick, at the third quarter result, you seem to be very confident about gross margin. In fact, I think at the time we know that it was probably the most positive gross margin commentary we'd heard out of ResMed in recent memory. So I know you've spoken to component cost and why you don't manage the gross margin, but what else changed since the time you gave that, that commentary to the result?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question. And I think actually if you go back and look, the all the factors that I talked about 90 days ago, we're talking about today, but in addition, the AirSense 11 ramp that we're putting together there. What happened in these 90 days that was unpredicted was -- there was more demand. What we thought a competitor may be back, and there was more demand for CPAPs and APAPs and we didn't -- I know the exact number of how we could have slowed down our AirSense 10 generation to get gross margin to be plus 30 basis points from QtoQ, but we didn't engineer it and reverse engineer it that way. We said, there's demand out there, let's go take care of those patients. That was the unexpected factor. It was U.S. CPAP and APAP demand. And I mean, you look through the numbers, you'll see that it was incredibly strong on gross profit generation, cash flow generation, incredibly strong during the quarter. And we did think about it. Oh gosh, do we follow through and saying, oh, we want to get accretive GM, 90-day to 90-day point or do we say take care of that patient? And we said, no, we're going to do the right thing. We're going to take care of the patient. So we're thinking about the long-term here. But no, I'm still bullish over this fiscal year for sure. I -- you never can know what demand's going to look like and where it's at and we are not going to not take care of a patient. But as those higher inventory costs work their way through our system there's opportunity for gross margin improvement as we go forward. There's also the impact of if you looked at the SG&A this time a year ago in the June quarter of 2022 versus 2023, there was still a lot of people on that sort of COVID. I'm not traveling, I'm not going to see customers, I'm not going to do the strategic meetings and the planning meetings. We've opened some of that up, as you saw in our SG&A and so that's impacting our net margin as well. We're going to manage those tightly and carefully. And we'll probably have some further vigilance, if you like, on our SG&A and we won't be pulling back really on R&D. I think that the innovation engine has to continue to grow, and we're doubling down on AI, and I think our leadership and digital health, we have to make that happen. So I'm still bullish throughout the fiscal year of FY2024. But we're not going to not take care of a patient if there's excess demand with a CPAP and APAP to manage one component of the P&L versus taking care of the patients and thinking about the one, three, five-year strategic engagement with the patient, with the physician, with the provider, and doing the right thing for the industry. So that's the sort of factors that have changed in the next 90 days. And I hope actually all this comes together and we continue to do both, right, drive the needs of the patient and be able to get accretion in our GM. And I'm very confident we'll do that over the coming 3, 6, 9, 12 months.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, could I get to comment a little on what you saw in the ex-U.S. market? Obviously last quarter we saw the big event sale ventilator sales into China. Just wondering if there's any countries you'd call out or any items we should be aware of, please.
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, that's a good point. We didn't really see anything of material context in this quarter in terms of exacerbation of COVID that that led to hospital based or life support ventilator sales. And so we're back to I would say some steady growth that we see in our neuromuscular disease, our COPD and other sort of respiratory insufficiency parts of our business for life support vents. On the non-invasive vents and adaptive server vents and bi-levels, we're back to steady market growth and actually we saw strong double-digit growth as those post-COVID, we're starting to see the clinics open up and patient flows start to come back. Rob, any thoughts on ventilators?
Rob Douglas: No. Not on ventilators, because I'm just going to comment on masks.
Mick Farrell: Yes.
Rob Douglas: So the masks in all these other markets were really strong and really it's showing underlying strength of the market not affected by recall dynamics or anything like that. So really the whole patient diagnostic systems are working in order and everything's going strongly.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now line.
Steve Wheen: Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask Brett about the working capital position. Again, last quarter we were -- you were thinking that you'd be able to make some inroads into those -- into the inventory balances that you had such that we might see a bit of more of the release of cash, but obviously inventory stepped up again as has the receivables. Is that just building more to the demand that you see? Or could you just help put that into a bit more context as why it didn't quite play out the way you thought?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Hi, Steve. It's Brett. The inventory actually came down a little bit sequentially, so that, that's sort of tracking down how we're expecting. We expect that inventory balance should decline over the course of FY024 as well. The receivables you're right was up a little bit, but that's really driven by the revenues. I think overall in the working capital, we're in pretty good shape. It was up a little bit this quarter. When you look at that, we -- it's really the timing around tax payments this quarter. So we paid higher tax this quarter than we would typically do each quarter. So that's that drive, if you like, a little bit of negative working capital. But again, that's just a timing element. So we're expecting pretty robust cash flow generation through each of the quarters in FY2024. And we'll continue to work hard on the working capital and bringing that down. A big driver of that will obviously be the inventory and working that down progressively over the fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham and Company. Your line is now live.
Joseph Conway: Hi guys, this is Joseph on for Mike. Could you maybe talk about the new patient and REPAP backlog internationally? I guess the way that I understand it is it's fully worked through in the U.S. but there's still work to do internationally. I don't know if you -- if that's the case and if you could size that at all.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look, I don't think we've fully worked through the backlog of patients in the U.S. in terms of patients who want to get whose insurance has got to the five-year point if their Medicare or three, four, five depending on which private payer they're under. And so I do think our competitors' actions slowed down that, that particularly if they're on a competitive device and the demand limitation and the physician saying, look, I've got to take care of new patients. They weren't as prone to write prescriptions or to allocate REPAP, if you like, for patients. So I actually think there's some runways still left on REPAP within the U.S. geography, and I think that's even more so in other markets. As Rob just noted and as we talked about the engagement with consumers and patients in different geographies is driving mass growth and any quarter that have 14% revenue growth in masks in Europe, Asia, rest of the world would be incredible. And that's not driven by any recall dynamics whatsoever from a competitor. Everybody's been competing in masks globally. And so I think that speaks to our ability to hopefully have a sustainable approach to REPAP not only in the U.S. where we have incredibly strong relationships with Brightree and myAir directly to patients, directly to providers but the ecosystems that we are generating in some of our other sort of omni-channel markets around the world. So I think the opportunity for REPAP in the U.S. is still there over this fiscal year and beyond, and to make it a rhythm, right? So it becomes a steady part of the growth of the devices and to drive it. I think there's even more opportunity in the other parts of the world leveraging the work we've done on the mask side to then remind patients and track them when they're at that three, four, five-year time period to pull forward. Now I want to be there with the appropriate supply, so I'm not jumping ahead of ourselves, but we do have the programs and capabilities to do that, but I think the demand is there inherently.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Good morning, Mick, and good day, Brett and Rob. Just wondering on masks, it's been a while since we've seen some new product coming out from ResMed. Just wondering how much has the recall -- better recall impacted on your ability to continue to focus on new product development and new product launch? And I guess on the mask side, should we expect anything for near-term in terms of a refresh of the mask portfolio? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. So it's a great question and yes, our R&D team, have obviously been incredibly focused on the re-engineering, the resupply and the redesign on our core device platforms, and we're able to do that, right? So we're able to get the supply back of Air 10s, as you saw, and Air 11s. But yet, look, I -- we had the whole board down in Sydney last quarter, and we were looking through the pipeline of devices and masks and it's incredible. It's really exciting. I don't like to get ahead of my commercial teams, and one of them is at the table with me now telling me to keep quiet. But I can tell you I'm very excited about the pipeline. There will be new innovation, new masks from ResMed as we go through this fiscal year. And as a personal user of these products, I try every new mask that comes out and this new one, which has a great project name that I'm not able to say, but it's a beautiful island that you can travel to by boats. I have tried that that mask and it's incredible and I can't wait for that to come to the market. But yes, look, we do have masks that are coming in the pipeline that are working their way through regulatory and then of course, commercial ramp up to make sure that when we deliver, it's ResMed quality, ResMed capability, first time fit, incredible adherence, and to drive through the channel. And so you'll see those come through our major markets and then globally throughout the fiscal year. So I'm excited about that pipeline. The one that I can talk about is the digital side, where we've launched an AI product and I'm really excited as those get more traction, we'll talk about how the digital products and the mass products throughout the year are going to impact and keep our incredibly strong double-digit growth that we saw this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. And thanks to all of our stakeholders for joining us this last hour as we talked through our results. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days. In closing, I want to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are shareholders and listen to these calls as well, thanks for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better, live better lives in 140 countries. These results are yours, incredible double-digit growth. Thanks for all that you do. I'll hand the call back to you Amy to close this out.
Amy Wakeham: Awesome. Thank you, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our ResMed's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close the call.
Operator: Thank you. You may now disconnect. We do thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-04-27 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the ResMed’s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Chief Communications and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Hey thank you Kevin. Hello everyone and welcome to ResMed’s third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be available on the investor relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings press release and the presentation both of which are available now. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel for our Q&A session. During today’s call we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the supporting schedules in today’s earnings release. Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to expectations about our future financial and operating performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however our actual results could differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I’d like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Amy and thank you to our stock holders for joining us today as we review results for the March quarter. Our third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results reflect very strong performance across our entire business. Through the hard work of our ResMed team worldwide, we’ve been able to steadily improve supply and manufacturing output to deliver for customers, and most especially for patients with now full market availability of our life saving products and Therapy Solutions. During the quarter, we were able to offer unconstrained access to cloud connected AirSense 10 flow generated devices in North America, as well as improved access to those cloud connected devices across our global markets. We continue to work through some supply chain constraints with our latest and greatest AirSense 11 platform, and we expect to steadily improve the global availability of AirSense 11 over the next several quarters. We are thrilled to have the AirSense 10 platform off allocation and fully available to customers in the U.S. and other major markets in swift succession. I would like to send a huge personal thank you to our Six Sigma Black Belt supply chain and our manufacturing teams. Partnering with our global supplier Alliance, we have been able to significantly increase production to the point that we are now able to deliver cloud connected devices to meet the needs of all of our customers in the U.S. And we are working hard to make that the case in all 140 countries that we sell into worldwide as we move forward. Last quarter, we made a commitment to meet the global demand for connected CPAP and APAP devices with a combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 by the end of calendar year 2023. As I just noted, we have already achieved that goal in our largest market, and we will be well ahead of that goal across all of our global markets. Supply chain challenges aren’t completely behind us but we have passed the idea in supply and we see steady increases in supply ahead. Our amazing R&D teams and global supplier Alliance teams have designed and validated new components. They have added new suppliers and they have worked hand in hand with existing suppliers to secure the flow of parts that we need. We’re also focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities with the world’s biggest and highest output manufacturing plant on the planet in the field of respiratory medicine. That high tech facility is now fully up and running in Tuas, Singapore. We are working country by country to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as we ramp production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform across global markets. Given this global ramp plan, we expect to remain on allocation for the AirSense 11 platform for the next few quarters with AirSense10 covering all the difference in demand. With this combination of Air 10 and Air 11. We have the two best sleep apnea therapy platforms in the market. And we are now able to service all of our customer’s needs. Our incredible growth rates of 43% in global device revenue this quarter speaks to that market leadership position of these two platforms, customers are voting with their wallets. Our mask and accessory business also continued to its strong growth trajectory, with 15% global growth in constant currency this quarter across our masks businesses. Mask growth is supported by both new patient growth as well as enhanced resupply programs to existing to existing patients catalyzed by on-going core patient demand. We have now reached the point that new patient flow is well above the levels we saw pre-COVID. In fact, March this we just finished March 2023 was our highest quarter ever for new patient’s setups in our cloud based patient management system called AirView. Our digital health ecosystem enables and drives long-term adherence pushing towards 90% adherence for our highest performing customers. Even as we’ve now past three years since the start of COVID there continues to be sustained heightened awareness by patients of the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. This has been a major step change that has held for now 12 quarters, we consider that a permanent change at this point. In the U.S. market, customers resupply programs including Brightree ReSupply have augmented growth. In our consumer driven markets, outreach programs and subscription programs have also driven masked replenishment rates. Patients want fresh equipment because there is less leak and more comfort for them the person who was suffocating before this treatment. Physicians want fresh equipment because they have seen peer reviewed published evidence that patient resupply is directly correlated to increased patient therapy adherence. Our teams continue to work incredibly hard to achieve these double digit growth results amid a challenging industry environment. All 10,000 of us ResMedians are laser focused on continuing to live both the devices and masks for our customers globally every week, every month and every quarter. Let’s now briefly review updates on the top three strategic priorities for our company. Number one, to grow, expand the reach of and differentiate our core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Number two, to design develop and deliver market leading devices as well as market leading digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to create, innovate and grow the world’s best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital. The launch of and market reaction to our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, Air 11 adoption rates of myAir are more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform. It turns out that patients love getting their own data every day on their myAir app with a daily score, daily coaching, therapy engagement through advanced analytics and patient focused algorithms. Patient utilization of a digital health platform like myAir is directly linked to adherence, which is then directly linked to better patient outcomes as seen by the physician, which ultimately drives better outcomes for the payer and the provider. Given these trends, increasing production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform clearly remains a top priority and an obligation and we will continue to drive market penetration, leading the market, expanding the market as we scale production and achieve regulatory approvals country by country. Meanwhile, we continue to improve the software and digital health technology that drives a significant component of the value proposition for our connected devices. Over the next several quarters, we will introduce several artificial intelligence driven coaching features into the AirView system, as well as on the patient facing myAir app. These AI algorithms will provide personalized suggestions to improve the patient experience and ultimately to increase patient therapy adherence. Many of these AI driven solutions will be available on both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 ecosystems. ResMed’s AirSense 11 device is the best positive airway pressure device on the planet, followed very closely by the second best device, which is the AirSense 10 platform. And together they share the same digital health technology ecosystem. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem supporting these platforms as we innovate solutions for the benefit of physicians, providers, and especially patients. The bottom line is that our digital health technology investments have a multiplier effect across both Air 10 and Air 11 ecosystems catalyzed and powered by AirView and myAir. Pivoting to our respiratory care business, we continue to drive growth and adoption of our bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions around the world as well as investing in our newer to market technologies for patients including neuromuscular disease, COPD, and asthma and beyond. During the quarter we announced a pilot collaboration between our digital therapeutics team under the Propellor health brand, and the University of California Davis Health System. This partnership allows eligible UC Davis Health patients to have access to Propellor’s digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications, a mobile app, a web portal, as well as on-going patient support. Data from the Propeller sensors will be transmitted to the UC Davis Health Electronic Health Record system through an API to support patient enrollment and remote patient monitoring. It’s still early days for this technology. However, combined with our investments in clinical research for home based high flow therapy for the treatment of COPD in the home we see these technology innovations as important clinical additions for treating respiratory disease and an integral part of our 2025 growth strategy, as we now pivot to look beyond to ResMed 2030. Turning to our software as a service offerings for care delivered outside the hospital, our SaaS business grew strongly at 35% year-over-year in the quarter, including the contribution from our recently acquired MEDIFOX DAN team in Germany. On an organic basis, SaaS growth in the quarter achieved high single digit growth of 9% across our SaaS portfolio. We’re excited about the strong sustainable growth of our core SaaS business. And we’re very pleased to see MEDIFOX DAN contributing to our growth in its first full quarter as part of the global RedMed Group. We continue to grow with customers that deliver care outside the hospital, as they increase utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. Here at ResMed, we believe the future of healthcare is in lower cost, lower acuity settings, we are investing in technology that our customers need to operate and scale as patient volumes grow in these facilities and out of hospital facilities. As opposed to COVID, patient census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent up demand for technology investments that continue to come to market across skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and beyond. Our Home Medical Equipment SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and deliver sustained profitable growth. We are seeing the on-going impacts of staffing shortages across all of the outside hospital healthcare verticals that we serve. This pressure on our customers provides opportunities to drive conversations about the benefits of our software solutions to streamline and drive efficiencies across their businesses, so that they can free up staff to focus on their core purpose of serving patients and improving patient outcomes. Our SaaS business remains an important part of ResMed’s growth strategy, and it complements the market leading software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. Our Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate the synergies we can generate between our SaaS business and our core SRC business. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the payer on coverage, communicating directly with the patient, collecting co-pays, and managing the logistics and distribution process of product. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. This results in better outcomes for the patient, the physician, the provider, and the payer. We are well positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally. And we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 14 point 5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 20.5 100% Cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers, and entire healthcare systems. We are leading the industry and we won’t stop innovating. We’re investing 7% of our revenue in R&D. It’s worth noting that the annualized revenue pool is now well north of $4 billion. There is so much opportunity ahead of us. It’s inspiring and it’s exciting. ResMed’s mission remains crystal clear. We have a goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal with our growth over the last 90 days. And during the last 12 months we have improved over 156 million lives with the delivery of the device platform to a patient or a full mask system to a patient or a digital health software solution that directly impacts the patient, helping each person to sleep better, to breathe better and to live a high quality life with health care delivered right where they live. Let me close my remarks with my sincere gratitude to the more than 10,000 ResMedians working across 140 countries for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today, and every day. Thank you. With that, I’ll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then get in the queue because we will open up for Q&A from the group. Brett, over to you
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I’ll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q3. Group revenue for the March quarter was $1.12 billion an increase of 29%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 31%. Revenue growth reflected improved availability of sleep devices to support the strong underlying demand for these products, as well as solid growth across our broader product portfolio. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies in particular, weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million in the March quarter. We record an incremental revenue of approximately $15 million from COVID related demand in the March quarter. However, looking forward we expect negligible revenue from COVID related demand. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 32%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 28% in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 43%, while masks and other sales increased by 15%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 48% as we benefited from strong demand and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 14%, reflecting solid resupply and growth in new patients setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 36% in constant currency terms, again reflecting strong demand and improving availability of connected devices. Masked and other sales increased by 15% in constant currency terms, reflecting increased patient setups. Software as a service revenue increased by 35% in the March quarter, reflecting the contribution from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, and continued strong performance from our HMV vertical. Excluding our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue grew by 9% in the March quarter. MEDIFOX DAN acquisition contributed revenue of $26.6 million for the March quarter consistent with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. During the rest of my commentary, today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 200 basis points to 56.1% in the March quarter. The decrease primarily reflects product mix shifts use a significant increase in sleep device sales, as well as component cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency movements partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 25% or in constant currency terms increased by 28%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs and travel expenses, as well as the incremental SG&A expense associated with our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.5% compared to the 21.1% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 14% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7.7% in the prior quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profits for the quarter increased by 27% underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by a lower gross margin. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN our net interest expense for the quarter was $15 million and we expect interest expense to be a similar amount for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 20% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the March quarter increased by 28% and non-GAAP, diluted earnings per share increased by 27%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $283 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings partially offset by a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and Amortization for the quarter totaled $44 million. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $228 million. As of March 31, we had $1.6 billion in gross debt, and $1.4 billion in net debt reflecting the funding of our previously announced MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. During the quarter, we reduced our revolver debt by $215 million. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we have approximately $605 million available for drawdown under our revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D, reduce our overall debt levels, and deploy further capital for tuck in acquisitions. And with that, I’ll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Kevin, I’d like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Yes, good morning. All. Before I start, I want to say thank you to David Pendarvis. You know, we’re certainly sad to see him retire. But we know that we’re in safe hands with Amy. In terms of my question, obviously some very good device revenue there. But I want to just to talk about the you mentioned the third quarter, you had a new patient high higher than what we’ve seen pre-COVID. Can you provide some comments of how much of that new patient backlog remains? And also what sort of progress you’re making on the Repat backlog? And if you can discuss that, according to the Americas investor [Indiscernible] separately, that’d be very helpful.
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks for the question, Lyanne and a tribute to Dave for his 20 plus years, 22 years of I think it was this is his 83rd investor call 83. So amazing tribute to Dave and we are in very safe hands with Amy on investor relations front. To your question. Look, yes, incredible growth, 43% growth in device revenue this quarter to an all-time high. You know, many, many factors that have gone into that primarily that we were able to deliver on our promise to get unconstrained on AirSense 10 a 100% connected devices, we’ve got those end market. And so I think, we were able to take care of all of the demand of customers in the U.S. market period, end of story. We said we’d be there by the end of this calendar year. But we’re they’re already here right now. And as I said in the prep remarks, we’re going to be scaling the AirSense 11, steadily and strongly as that new platform, the latest and greatest comes to market and we move forward. In terms of backlog of those sort of new patients I think we’re there in the U.S. But in terms of REPAPING, I think there’s a lot more to do, and we’re going to partner, across the U.S. with all of our 1000s of home medical equipment companies to start to work through that REPAP program. But I think that’s going to happen over time. We just got to the point where we’re completely unconstrained on AirSense 10 in this quarter. I think it’s fantastic. I want to get unconstrained on AirSense 11. That’s going to take a number of huge numbers of quarters. And then of course, that’s just one country. We’re in 140 countries worldwide, we’re going to go get regulatory and all them and then get those products to market. And so it’s going to be an on-going process over the coming quarters and years to continue there. I’m not going to say that we’re going to see this sort of exceptional 43% growth, on an on-going basis, the market growth is closer to the mid to high single digits in this space. But we’re seeing that market growth come back. We’re seeing the new patients come back. We are through that that pandemic side and we’re getting new patient flow, we see it in our home sleep testing data, we’re looking at all the stuff coming throughout [Indiscernible]. We’re seeing it in the number of patients are being set up, in AirView, all time high. But we’re looking at that every week, every month and every quarter, and it’s steadily improving. And it’s not just the U.S. It’s, it’s in Western Europe, Northern Europe. And it’s and it’s certainly coming through Asia, very strong growth in China over the last number of quarters as we’ve come through the COVID crisis there as well. So that’s my summary there, Lyanne. Great question.
Lyanne Harrison: Sorry, can I just clarify when you said that you’re there on the backlog? Is that both for the United States and rest of the world?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So we’re through, we’re through the backlog in the U.S. And we’re going to be progressively working our way through the other 139 countries that, it’s it’s not, it’s a complex system, where when you get regulatory approvals let’s say, for the AirSense 11, you’ve got to go region, by region, you can do you know, European Union, but then you have to go country by country for many of these approaches for Brazil, for China for India, and it takes time to get them there to get unconstrained with the two platform approach that we’ve been able to take in the U.S., Canada and a number of other countries. But look, we’ll give you updates over the coming quarters. Lyanne as we get unconstrained country by country, you’ll you will report it to you. And our goal is to be unconstrained everywhere tomorrow. It’s just not logistically possible to be able to do that. So we’re going slowly and steadily to that, but I’m just happy to be, nine months ahead of when we were saying we’re going to deliver an unconstrained at least in some of our top markets here, and we’ll keep you updated as we go forward.
Lyanne Harrison: Okay, thank you very much Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Someone else asked the gross margin question. But I’d like to ask about the SG&A. And just the fact that it’s remained relatively constant as a percentage rip scent of revenue during the course of the record, which to say a bit counterintuitive, when you consider the fact that the product had been shortages, etcetera, and suddenly was selling themselves. So I just wonder if we could talk about the key elements of that SG&A and the mid-to-long term trajectory there as volumes continue to improve?
Mick Farrell: Yes, that’s a great question. Daniel, I’ll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover our SG&A.
Rob Douglas: Yes, Dan. So you know how we operate, no matter what’s going on, we’re fiscally disciplined. We’re always keeping an eye on the future and where we’re going and what’s happening as we build, we build in expenses. We absolutely talked about the fact that we weren’t doing face to face marketing, and a lot of travel and those types of things earlier in the pandemic. And as that started to come back, we’ve had to manage carefully how that’s been an extra load on our SG&A. But it’s really, really a factor of careful management. Everyone’s aware of the issue of employee costs, and those things which is which are moving in the time of inflation. And we continue to manage that carefully. And we’re extremely prudent about what we add in on and how we go. And so we really don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and end up like some of these other companies that have found them way over provisioned in there -- and they go-to-market operations and had to make corrections. So we’re, we’re in good shape, and we’ve got a solid plan. And, we should be able to stick very carefully with our bets our forecast on our SG&A.
Operator: Take your next question today. It’s coming from Matthew Silvia [Ph] from Citi. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Good afternoon. To those in California. You obviously had a very strong devices growth in the quarter. I was just wondering whether you still believe that you can sequentially grow every quarter in fiscal year 2023 in devices? And then how should we think about FY 2024 and the returns potential return of Philips to the market and whether there’s been any update there?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Matthew. And yes, not -- last quarter, I certainly said that we expect to see sequential growth of devices throughout the calendar year, actually here through 2023. And those are forecasts. I got to tell you, this $607.9 million of device sales in the quarter was ahead of where I thought we were at that point. That’s a big number to come up. And as Brett said, there’s about 15 million of ventilator sales to China in there, as they went through another phase of, of COVID as they reopened during the during the March quarter. So if you take that out, it’s still a big number to shoot for here in Q4. But we have the best commercial teams on the planet in respiratory medicine, sales. And you know in Q4, our fiscal year Q4 is a big time there's presence clubs in some geographies, there's fiscal incentives everywhere for people to finish their fiscal year strong. And so there’s a lot of incentives. So it’s a tough number to get there on sequential growth. Taking out those ventilators, I think we can do it, I’m confident my team, I’ll back my team. They got a little bit ahead of me here in March. And I love that I’d love them to be a little bit ahead of me in June. And so I’m confident we can do that. More important than that is that we are now taking care of every patient’s needs in our major markets. And our goal is to be there in all 140 countries. So some of it is that that revenue growth, and it’s amazing, but it’s really about patient care. And it’s about leaving no patient behind. And it was really disappointing. I think, for us as an industry, some of these quarters over the last eight quarters, that as an industry, we weren’t able to take care of every patient that got a prescription. We’re now doing that in our major markets. And we plan to absolutely fulfill that not only where we’ve already achieved it, but to get ahead of it in all the other countries as we go. So sequential growth is good, we’re going to be pushing towards trying that. But more important than that, taking care of every patient in every geography, and working as hard as we can to get to those patients and get them a well quality mask and get them on a resupply program because that’s what leads to long-term adherence, not just that one time device sale, but getting an adherent patient that 87, 90 plus percent adherence rates on not just a 90 day basis, but an on-going basis. That’s our challenge. Matthew, great question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks, good morning all. I’ll ask the gross margin questions. Is the mix really the key driver of the way to gross margins here? Do you have is the higher price offsetting component costs? And just as we look forward, if you’re going to continue to assume strong device sales growth, should we expect gross margins to continue to be weaker at these levels in the short term? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the for the question, Gretel. And as you said, and as Brett said in his prep remarks, we had some we had some headwinds on gross margin, which were geography mix, where, it was more in low margin countries, U.S., Canada, and in product mix, we saw more CPAP and APAP growth than we did by level or life support or even other non-invasive ventilators. And so, those headwinds are going to start to subside, but I, I am actually I think Gretel that, as I look forward, I see gross margin expansion in double digit basis points ahead for the coming quarters and throughout the fiscal year and the calendar year. I’m bullish on gross margin expansion because I see geography mix and product mix, headwinds subsiding. I’m bullish on gross margin, as I see ventilator growth, opportunities start to come back and I see mass growth and replenishment growth, new patient growth start to come on masks. And I’m bullish on gross margin as we go forward because I see inventory costs starting to we’re going to start to cut into that and bring them down versus the run up we had with our competitor being out of market. And I also I’m bullish on gross margin, because I see us being able to get better freight costs as we go forward. And as you said, we have been offsetting some of that gross margin headwinds with ASP holding steady in our core business, increasing ASPs in our SaaS businesses. And we’ve had some freight surcharges and others with customers, as we start to see our costs come down, we’ll take away some of those surcharges and so on and so we’ll balance that out. But net net, I see us being able to expand our gross margin and grow as we look forward throughout, not just the fiscal year 2023, but the calendar year here in 2023.
Operator: Thank you Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Matt Taylor: Alright, thanks. So sorry, I was on mute. I just wanted to ask about how much we should expect the mask trend to start following the device trends as you become more encumbered. I thought maybe there would be a little bit more mass growth this quarter, not taking away from a good result. But maybe you can talk about that as a derivative.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks, Matt, for your for your question. And you know that as you look at our masks and accessories business, that sort of 70% to 80% of our masks growth is replenishment, its existing patients out there who are coming back for a fresh mask, a fresh humidifier, a fresh set of tubing, heated tubing, and so on and filters. So it’s the mask and accessories is 70% 80% replenishment business. And so it’s not as directly impact. So new patient growth is incredible. We’re back to better than pre-COVID. And we’re growing from there. And that’s great to see that sort of strong rise of new patients coming in, but it doesn’t sort of directly correlate to your point it’s less a derivative and more a sort of a compounding effect over time as you know like compound interest as you build up that install base those patients are ordering if they are, ordering on a three month or six month basis, that becomes a compounding effect on the device growth today leading to a future investment in growth in masks over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years as you build that installed base, so there’s not a direct correlation 43% device growth doesn’t immediately correlate to mass growth. But I mean, to your point 15% global mass growth on a constant currency basis is incredible pre-COVID, we would have been very proud of a number like that. Post pandemic coming through this growth. I’m incredibly proud of the team and what they’re able to do not just in new patient setups, but in the replenishment programs. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it’s not just in the reimbursed markets where we’ve got formalized systems. In France, the U.S. Japan, we have formalized systems to go with our customers to patients to ensure they if they want it that the patient gets a mask when they need it. We’re also working in our consumer driven markets where we’re driving adherence programs, subscription programs that are fast growing in many of our geographies where it’s cash pay, or direct to consumer interaction, and they’re saying, I want a fresh mask. And so it’s true to the core demand. It’s not just a system driven one, this is a patient driven one. And that’s the part about mass growth that I think is most exciting. Final thing I’ll say on mass growth, is that I think there was some skeptics, two or three years ago, people like oh, this step up in respiratory health and hygiene step up in mask replenishment, that’s a short term trend due to COVID pandemic, with three years since the start of this, this COVID pandemic, and that has been 12 quarters of strong mass growth. So I think that’s strong mass growth is sustainable for the future. We’ve been able to execute for 12 quarters and we plan to continue to do that as we go forward.
Matt Taylor: Thank you Mick. Very helpful.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.
Michael Polark: Thank you for taking the question. I’ll ask another twist on the mask question. As you’ve better filled on the device side, especially in the U.S., are you -- is there a halo impact in terms of winning share incrementally on the consumables side? Is that a dynamic that’s played out recently or could play out over the next year or so as the device kind of the urgency to step into the device void abates and you refocus on other priorities?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look, Mike, there’s certainly a relationship and when our commercial teams there are working with the best platform, the AirSense 11 and the best second best platform, the AirSense 10, both of which are better than our competitors, they’re also obviously offering the best masks, the best mask portfolio out there, and we have a leading share in that in all 140 countries as well. So there’s definitely a synergy effect in that it’s the same people, talking to the same physicians, the same providers, the same health care systems. And so we’re there. In addition, there’s some sort of clinical technical needs. I mean we design our products to work better together. Our masks on our devices have far more accurate mask leak detection. They have far more accurate detection of pressure and control of an APAP device or a bi-level device, and particularly if it’s used on an overlap patients say, who has obstructive sleep apnea and COPD, you need that IPAP and APAP, the press control to be right on. When you use our buy level with our mask that’s going to be far more accurate and the physicians know that and they will script towards that for those patients. And then for the respiratory therapist doing a setup, they know our products are designed better together. Our teams have shown in the clinical and technical data of how they’re designed. And so there is a strong positive synergy effect. So yes, I do think there’s a correlation with terminal. You can think the sort of simple commercial. I mean, they’re selling it, but then you look at it from the physician’s perspective on clinical and then the therapist perspective on fit and comfort and leak. So I think all that goes together to show there some good synergy between our device growth and mask growth over time.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, can I go back to gross margins. I mean if I heard you correctly, you said you expect gross margins to expand in the double digits in the future. Can you do a little bit on what sort of time frame? And are we talking gross margin percentage? Are we talking gross profits? Just trying to understand what you’re expecting on that front, please?
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, thanks. I’m going to hand to Brett to go through more detail. But what I was saying is I expect double-digit basis points improvement from where we were at in the quarter. 56.1%, I see is as an idea, and I want to grow from there. I see us being able to move that up, I don’t know, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 basis points over the coming quarters and beyond. But Brett, do you want to provide a little more detail for David, to the headwinds, the tailwinds and all the fun that goes into gross margin?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure. Sure, Mick. Yes, David, it’s -- I mean we wouldn’t -- we’re not going to try and quantify, but when we look at it, we do expect margin expansion over the coming quarters. So if you look at some of the key ones that have hurt us year-on-year or it’s around -- it’s product mix, obviously, with a massive increase in sleep devices. We had to deal with component cost increases coming through year-on-year, but that looks to be stabilizing there. So that’s -- there’s 2 big headwinds that we expect will moderate. And then we’re working on manufacturing, logistics, freight costs, we’re looking at efficiencies. So we’re focused back on that now. And that -- again, these should improve over the coming quarters as well. Then on top of that, with the AirSense 11 platform, that does contribute positively to gross margin as well. Now that one will take time as we roll that out. But if you kind of put in the -- I guess, you look at the sort of the headwinds are moderating, we should get a few tailwinds in manufacturing and logistics. And that kind of gives us the confidence we think we can get that expansion from here on in.
David Low: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question today is coming from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey everyone thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up on some of the patient demand metrics that you guys gave early on the call. I think I heard maybe high single-digit market growth in the U.S. or Americas. And then should we add repat to that so that, that ultimately leads us to a double-digit growth rate? And then how do you think about that, I guess, once Philips does potentially reenter the marketplace for you guys on a long-term growth. Can you, I guess, continue at that double-digit top line growth rate? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Malgorzata. I think there’s so much that goes into it. But yes, look, we -- we’re on the other side of this pandemic, right? Not only just the pandemics becoming endemic in the way that the world is opening up and we’re driving forward. But in our industry, we’re now seeing that strong growth of patients that we’re really starting to pick up. And yes, it’s mid- to high single digits growth on the patients starting to come through the funnel now, and that’s really strong. How long that’s sustainable and how we can drive it? That’s -- it’s going to be up to us as the market leader. We have the market lead here, and we’re going to drive awareness programs. We’re going to drive demand generation programs. We’re going to partner with I just got an update from a team here in the U.S. market, looking at a project to bring patients into the funnel and to drive patients into the funnel and as the market leader, that’s really our job, so not just accept market growth, but to drive market growth. So this is going to be an active thing that we’re going to be looking at as we move forward. And it’s very exciting for us to do that. I’m not going to quantify it out. I mean given where we’re at, I know you have your models, everyone on the sell side and buy side has their models. But I would say to that, whatever your models are, think about an active leader engaging in digital awareness, marketing awareness and driving and curating patients through the channel. And we’ve learned a lot through the COVID crisis about digital health, about engaging with patients in home testing in remote setup and virtual pathways that have really been necessary at the peak of the pandemic and now become a catalyst for future demand generation. So I don’t know, Rob or Lucie, if you have any extra thoughts on that?
Rob Douglas: Just one other minor point, Mick. That that new patient growth is really solid and there’s so many untreated patients. We can see a long-term future in that. But also as we build our long-term adherence programs and start driving long-term adherence, that will keep the mask growth ahead of that new patient growth and we see a long-term outlook for that to.
Operator: Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLS. Your line is now live
Andrew Paine: Yes, Hi morning and evening everyone. Just thinking about your ability to retain market share when Philips comes back to the market, it’s pick up in the -- but assuming from the start of FY 2024, what levers do you think you can pull here to ensure that you do retain market share? Are we looking at kind of things like pricing as a factor? Or do you think there’s other things that will help you retain that share?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. And yes, certainly, look, we look at all competition. We’ve got competitors based in Western Europe and in Asia that we’ve been competing with very strongly for the last few decades and certainly the last 2 years. And 1 competitor who’s been out of the market for new patient setups for 2 years and who knows how much longer, they’ll have to come in that third competitor that will have to come in and start fighting to become the number 2 share player from a 0% new patient setup share. And -- we look forward to that. We were beating that particular competitor in 2019 before they had their recalls. So I know we’ll be able to beat them when they come back in. And so no, our goal is to see 0 share. Our goal is to actually maintain and grow share as the market leader, that gets more and more difficult to take more and more share. But that’s our goal. We have the smallest, quietest, most comfortable and most cloud-connected devices. But more important than that, we’ve created a digital ecosystem that engages patients with myAir, doctors with our view, health care systems by APIs that link into Epic or Cerner in the U.S. and health care systems around the world in U.K. and NHS, Northern Europe into government and Western Europe into government-run health care systems. And we’re engaging with patients in our consumer-driven markets incredibly well. So our goal is to maintain and grow that share. But more important than that, to grow the market. As the market leader, that’s sort of our obligation. There are now with the latest epidemiology rising up around 1 billion people with obstructive sleep apnea that needs to be treated worldwide. And if you add in COPD asthma and insomia, you’re talking 2.5 billion people in our total addressable market. So -- you can think about share, but it’s really not Coke and Pepsi was out and Pepsi is coming back. This is not a low-growth carbonated beverages market. This is a high-growth digital health technology market in med tech, and that’s how we’re driving it forward. But yes, I look forward to just getting the uncertainty out of this number 3 player. I want to back in let’s see and let’s compete and we’ll keep our share and grow it and game on, look forward to it. And actually, one last thing I’ll say on that people have been talking about when the number 3 competitor comes back. How will they come back? Their CFO last week said, Oh, no, we won’t be coming in and lowering prices. We’ll look to take 2019 prices and add with inflation. So game on. I look forward to it. We’ve always competed on value. We’ve always competed on driving that, and it’s never been a competition on price for us. We’ve always been a price premium to the other players, but we save them more money. So that the smart customers are using our products because it’s more profitable.
Operator: Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Matthew Mishan: Yes, hi Mick, you mentioned at one point that you’re getting 90% adherence on some of your best customers. I’m just curious like where that is versus kind of baseline? And how you can move that forward with like the rest of your customer base?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Matt, it’s a really good question. And so the peer-reviewed published evidence out there is an 87% adherence number that’s been out there for a couple of years. If you look at the average of the market, where people maybe aren’t using as much of the digital capabilities, the patients aren’t using myAir, the doctors aren’t using AirView. General industry adherence might be on average, 60% to 70%, right, with a competitive device that’s not connected or maybe someone who’s not fully engaged with the digital ecosystem we have. As they start to get engaged, there’s actually a peer-reviewed published evidence on this, just adding just adding the doctor using AirView moves up adherence by 10%. So you go from, let’s say, an average of 65% to 75% for that customer. Just having the doctors AirView, if the patient uses myAir, you move up almost another 10%. So for that example, you might go from 75% to 85% adherence, where the doctor is using AirView and the patients using myAir. To get to those 90s, you need a really special customer that’s really engaged and really investing in tech that takes our tech and sort of adds algorithms, it adds capabilities to it. And we have a number of those sophisticated customers in Europe and the U.S., and we partner with them, and we do joint development with them. And we love that training. We learn from each other. Because together is how we deliver the care. We were a manufacturer and we’re a provider of digital health solutions, we’ve worked with providers in our biggest countries to get there. And where we don’t, in smaller consumer-driven markets, we have to pick up the ball and engage directly ourselves. But that 90% is achieved in very rare cases, but it’s -- that peer view published evidence shows that it can be done with the tech at 87%. And yes, to your point, how do we get everyone up to that 87% that 90%, that is a process of engagement of training. And that’s why I say our share is not only going to stay where it is, but have the chance to grow from that because we are the market leader in this. No one is investing like we are in cloud compute. No one is investing like we are in analytics in AI and ML and engagement with patients and physicians and providers. And we’re not doing alone. We’re doing it with the ecosystem, with the patients. We’re listening to them with the physicians and with the providers. Thanks for the question, Matt.
Operator: Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is live.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a question on Primasun. I just noticed this quarter, the investment was very low, certainly less than what the guidance had been. So I’m wondering, did something change this quarter? And any update on how that project is going? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. So it’s a great question because let’s just talk to our whole sort of demand generation and engagement approach. I mean, as you know, Primasun is a joint venture with Verily in the U.S. market, looking to digitally engaged -- well digitally identify, engage and enroll patients in a sort of digital health pathway from sleep concern consumer all the way through to diagnosed patient on treatment and management. We have activities through our core U.S. and North America marketing team. And obviously, in the other 139 countries we operate in, we’re looking at other digital ways to engage the 1 billion people who need our help. So look, we’re looking at investments. We’re at a pilot phase of some trials, and we’re getting ready to scale some approach with Primasun, with U.S. programs and many of the others were operating in all parts of the world. And so as we start to roll those out, now that we’re at the point where we’ve got full capability to supply, as we said in the prep remarks and throughout the call, with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 is a combination, we can really turn to start to turn the dial up on these demand generation initiatives with undiagnosed sleep apnea patients. And I’m excited to start doing that. So those investments might pick up a little over the coming quarters, but they’ll have a huge return in bringing patients into the funnel. So watch this space.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon, Mick, can you hear me all right?
Mick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Perfect. So first, let me just express my thanks to David. David, wish you have a great retirement. It’s been a pleasure dealing with you all these years. So Mick, a lot of questions have been asked. You comment about AI caught my attention. So Mick think about it this way. Suraj comes in, he’s gone through the CPAP titration, the sleep lab. Certain parameters have been set at a buy level variable, whatever. How would -- what parameters specifically would your AI/ML-based algos telepatient? And the reason I ask is specifically trying to understand how will you use this to improve compliance? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Well Suraj, it’s a really good question. And we only have 5 minutes left in the call. I could spend whole 50 minutes of them. A lot of those things are actually quite proprietary as we put together these AI and ML models on how we would coach a patient, particularly you talk about a high acuity patient like that on bi-level or ventilation, non-invasive ventilation therapy. But look, yes, certainly, I look at our compliance predictors and our compliance analysis tools that can help empower an HME in the U.S. and just some of the ways in which we’re able to use AI and ML to drive prioritization of the most at risk for quitting patients. And those who are so close enough to get there. And those were definitely there and just need some sort of digital coaching. That sort of triage, if you like, which has previously been done manually is now going to an automated way. And it’s -- we’ve always had some levels of that automation, but to have an algorithm that learns as it goes and to get better and better at it -- it just serves the doctor. It serves the respiratory therapists and both of them are super pleased to see that level of efficiency, reduction of if you like, the administrative management and focus on the toughest patients but also making sure that the best patients get the digital coaching and help that they need. So it’s really we’re triaging compliance, adherence and beyond. But watch this space. We’re going to launch a bunch of new products that I’ll be able to talk to very specifically what they are and what they do over the coming quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.
Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks for taking my question. I just note the inventory balances continued to increase. So I was wondering when you might start to see that come down? And also, is there much kind to cloud inventory or parts in that number still?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. It did move up just a little bit in the quarter. I actually have got a very strong target for Andrew Price, President of our operations and the whole manufacturing team to get that number down because we’re through the peak of this, and we’ve got full supply, let’s get that number down. But Brett, do you want to speak to some of the details of how we’re going to turn that inventory number down significantly over the coming quarters and fiscal year?
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Sure, Mick. Yes. I mean I’d characterize it, Craig that we stabilized that inventory this quarter and really that drove the really strong operating cash flow that you saw. But I think there’s more that we can do. And the aim is to reduce those inventory levels overall. I mean, a number of things we can do, but some of the -- someone might point out we’re seeing improvement in lead times, which will help. You’ve got I guess, getting from port to port improved a bit, so we can lower inventories. We’re continuing to increase sea freight versus air freight. So some of that manifest in inventory. But eventually, that kind of stabilizes at a ratio, we’re tuning safety stock levels now because we’ve got more predictability on what we need and when we can get supply. And then inventory, obviously, is future looking. So we’re looking to support sales. So we just got to balance all that. But all that said, I think we’re looking for inventory levels, that trajectory to gradually go down over the course of FY 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Cooper: Thanks, Mick. I’m just after your latest thoughts on the diabetes and obesity drugs, please. We -- I guess we had another positive update last night. They do seem to be coming thicken fast at the moment. I guess could you just share how ResMed thinking about these? And to what extent their success may have any impact on your business, please?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. No, it’s a huge market and actually quite exciting. We’ve always wanted to have interactions. We actually -- when I first joined the company 23 years ago, we were working with bariatric surgeons and looking at patients that would go through bariatric surgery and maybe from 450 pounds down to 200 pounds. And our challenge in those days when it was mostly a CPAP market was -- how do we make sure they get on APAC because their needs -- their AHI might go from 50 when they were at 450 pounds to 30, when they were 250 pounds, but that’s 30 is still severe sleep apnea. So we had to have an APAC algorithm could adjust with them. These days, the market is 80% APAP so you don’t need to make sure that a patient on a, let’s say, a weight loss drug or so on the seasonal weight loss and their AHI needs go down from very, very severely sleep apnea to just severe or moderate to severe. We have the algorithms and the capabilities within the devices with our audit set algorithm to adjust automatically. And we’ll also have all the digital health data. so that the pulmonary doctor can partner up with the primary care or bariatric-type doctor that’s working on -- and presumably be PCP is working the obesity drugs, and they can monitor the patient to see how much better they’re getting, maybe more inherent more participation in their fitness and exercise for the overall health. So for us, actually, and you know we’re invested in one of the sleep apnea drugs. It’s not a weight loss drug that actually goes to the core of trying to treat sleep apnea, which is called Apnemed [Ph]. We’re going to partner with pharma in this space. We’ve seen the substitute of the sort of tiny sort of whatever it is, 0.5% of patient flow into these implanted devices. And there’s a company out there doing, I think that’s a very expensive advertising, but it’s driving lots of patients into the funnel. It’s demand gen for us because they market it as a button to treat sleep apnea, but it’s actually an implanted medical device the size of a pacemaker that goes into the chest when the patient finds that out, they say, Well, what are the alternatives, although they are non-invasive alternative like CPAP or APAP or – when the patient goes online with that. I think some of the pharmaceutical advertising in this space will drive us to the 80% of undiagnosed patients in the space to say, Hey, look, I’ll take the pill first and maybe then I need sleep apnea therapy or vice versa. But we think there’s a lot of opportunity to partner here with pharma. We’re already partnering with our Propeller division with some of the COPD and asthma drug delivery. I look forward to not just with Apnemed, but these other obesity drugs to understand how they drive patients into the funnel and how we work with them to treat those patients.
Operator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you again to all of our stakeholders for joining us on the call. I’d once again like to take the opportunity to thank the 10,000 ResMedians. Many of you are also shareholders. So thank you for what you do and for investing in our company as well. Thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives in 140 countries. You delivered these numbers that we just reported. Thank you for all that you do. I’ll hand the call back to Amy, and then we’ll close out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick. Thanks, Kevin, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you do have any questions -- additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our third quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, you can now close this out.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-01-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the ResMed Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, please go ahead.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone. Happy new year and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results, review our progress towards our ResMed's 2025 strategic goals, and discuss our progress as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And we'll then move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We do believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could affect our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Amy and Kevin and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow-generator devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide and we're making steady progress, working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients. Our mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. ReSupply programs in the US continued to drive solid, ongoing sustained market mask growth catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the US geography. Mask sales across Europe, Asia, and the rest of world also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased. Our teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month, and every quarter, and our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023 and we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023. Customer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device remained strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device and refocus on our strategy which is based around the growth of 100% cloud connectable devices across the globe. Outside the US, we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud Device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market-by-market. To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December and we look forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world leading 100% cloud connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology. Our number one priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma, and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly review updates on ResMed's top three strategic priorities. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home. The launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app. Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our ResMedians around the globe and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter. Earlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the US market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices, so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress the throughout fiscal 2023 on this endeavor. An important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high flow therapy solutions. We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilated devices around the world and we saw good uptake of both our life support and our non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in home based high flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part -- an important part of our 2025 growth strategy. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS fast business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our US-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately six weeks of MEDIFOX DAN revenue as we closed that acquisition and welcome that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. As the post- COVID patients census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market. Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the US market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in-person with many of the key leaders of the MEDIFOX DAN team and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team. This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the US market, but I can tell you, the global SaaS team is very much in sync and they have come out of the grade strongly not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency, beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver. Our SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we have in our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program. Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage, and interacting directly with the patient on co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP or bilevel therapy user replenished with the suppliers that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. We have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy and we also have peer reviewed published data in CHEST showing, what’s called the ALASKA study that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus control. These are incredible data and they lead to these synergies not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost-saving opportunity for the healthcare system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved. We will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for customers and long term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities. We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race. As the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carlos Nunez was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs for the healthcare system. Their mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, show that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade. We're excited about the ways Carlos and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs, and improving outcomes, and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient, or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live higher quality lives with healthcare delivered right where they live, and mostly, in their own home. Before I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication both today and every day. Thank you. With that I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&A from the group. Brett over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increased device demand generated by our competitor’s product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. As mentioned, we closed the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition on November 21, 2022 and accordingly, we have recognized MEDIFOX DAN revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY 2023 results from this date. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year 2023. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in US, Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. Our product segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and others sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the Card-to-Cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue, including revenue from our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix shifts due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions, and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 4%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2023 associated with the joint venture operation. On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN for consideration of $997 million and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility. During the quarter, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, and we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY 2023. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MEDIFOX DAN acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year 2023, reflecting our increased debt position. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to fund at future tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great, thanks, Brett and thanks Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide the instructions and then run the Q&A portion of our call.
Operator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Cooper: Thanks. Good morning -- good afternoon. So, good to hear the fully connected AirSense 10 is now off allocation. Can I ask what happens with the C2Cs that have effectively now I presume surplus to requirements? And are there any sort of impacts on pricing or inventory valuation we need to think about in the second half?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Chris and it's a good one. Obviously, we're thrilled to have AirSense 10 fully connected now, unconstrained in the US geography. As you know, we operate in 140 countries worldwide. The AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory, we're working our way through that and it actually is moving very quickly. I'd state it this way that we've got the number one device in the market, which is the AirSense 11 fully connected in terms of customer ratings. We also have the number two device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. But then we have the number three device the third best device in the market, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, I believe that's better than the tier 2, 3, 4 competitors that are in the market. And so we've got the number one, two, and three device there and we're selling them and different customers want different things. And certainly, the AirSense 11 fully connected is at a price premium. But we'll start to see, I think us work through all of our inventory, the excess patient demand is still there globally. And I think we'll be there for a period of time, even after one of our competitors looks like they may come back into the market, hopefully sometime this this calendar year so that we can get our mask attachment rates on to them. But yes, Chris, we expect to work through all that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud inventory. Good question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Mick, can you hear me all right?
Mick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Congrats on a great quarter. Hey, Mick, maybe I'm just trying to thread the needle here, but love to get some extra color. I heard you say by 2025, 250 million lives, that's the plan. If I use where you are currently, let's say 150 million, just rounding it off, that's a 70% almost jump in patient covered life -- covered by CPAP. How should I think about the implied guide? Am I jumping the gun here? Or are you sort of telegraphing you'll should be in a position for the next three years deliver about 17%, 18% CAGR? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Suraj, it's a great question and how we measure the lives changed is a pretty simple formula includes the CPAPs, APAPs, bi-level devices. But it also includes full mask systems, which you know, the sort of linear growth, if you like of the devices and some slight exponential growth of the mask systems because of replenishment rates and repeat customers coming back. But it also includes patients' lives touched through digital health. So, whether it's a Brightree patient who gets access to their device or other HME equipment, whether it's a patient in COPD medicines that gets an app that reminds them to take their medicine on a Propeller, or a patient that has a life support ventilator that gets a digital health reminder to get replenishment. And so combining all those impacts on a life. And the way I look at it is a life is changed as much by a brand new device arriving in their house as it is by an app that helps them take a medicine that keeps them out-of-hospital. So, that's how we sort of look at lives change. Yes, 150 million calendar year 2023, you got it, right. I mean, you got the math, the mathematics there is the CAGR is 17.5% volume growth of the lives that we touch over the next three calendar years through 2025 and we're going to do that. We're going to get more and more patients on CPAPs, APAPs, bi-levels, more and more on ReSupply and masks systems, and then more and more on our digital health platforms. And we've got -- it's a lofty goal and it's a stretch goal, but we believe we can get there and change 250 million lives by 2025. Thanks Suraj. Great question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Mathew Mishan: Hey. Good afternoon, Mick. Just a quick question on the gross margins. Just how has the productivity of manufacturing and shipping improved over the last few months? Are you guys still working through, like high-cost inventory? How much spot buying is there? And then is sort of the decrease in gross margins -- slight decrease in gross margin, mainly on the mix of devices versus masks and accessories?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Matt, I'll start and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer to cover in detail. But just at the start, yes, there was a sequential decrease in gross margin. One way, Matt, I could have avoided that is tell the team don't sell all those CPAPs and APAPs, to create, right because it was great gross profit dollars to the business and was great to change a patient's life by a new device, but I could have get my GM 70, 80 basis points up by saying slow down those CPAP and APAP sales. Of course, we didn't do that. The right thing is the humanitarian aspect to get those devices that we pivoted, our supply chain reengineered and redesigned to get them to market and you saw extraordinary growth, 41% growth in our US-based device market. Now, that's not our highest gross margin, its diluted to GM percentage, but it's contributory and positive to gross profit dollars. And so it's good for patients, and it's good for our stakeholders. So, that's what we did. But Rob, yes, some a really good question -- first part of the question.
Rob Douglas: Yes, Matt, thanks for question. There's lots of factors in that gross margin and you're asking specifically about productivity and productivity improvements. We've done a whole lot of work around volume improvements and really driving volume and all of our discussions with suppliers have been increasing volume and reliability of delivery. Our normal settings in normal world is we have a long-term outlook volume commitment and we're looking at optimization and pricing improvements and things like that. Those activities have pretty well been on hold while we've been doing these -- this sort of real scramble that drive volumes. Freights a similar situation, although we are seeing freights probably going to improve faster than some of these other costs that were in there. But totally in terms of our supply chain culture, we absolutely will be aiming to go back to our continuous improvement situation where we have a really strong volume leverage gain. We continue to drive the volumes in a systematic way and we use that to drive productivity and drive cost out of the system.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.
Steve Wheen: Yes, thanks Mick. I just wanted to follow up on that gross margin question. In the previous quarter, I think it was -- Brett was talking to the efficiencies that you're achieving through doing more volume, was -- the margin benefit from that efficiency was sitting in your inventory balance and that's obviously been building and built again this quarter. I'm just interested is that still the case that when that inventory comes off the balance sheet, you should automatically start to see the efficiency gains that you've been able to achieve to-date?
Mick Farrell: Brett, do you want to have a first go of that question?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Mick thanks. So, Steve, yes, I mean, that's -- what we're doing -- I mean -- I think Rob articulated really, at the moment, we're optimizing for delivery rather than efficiency and we got things like we're running the three platforms at the moment. So, I'm really focused on delivering devices to patients. So, that's having an impact. The big one is work through inventory or the wash-through is the freight cost. So, we're seeing some reduction in freight costs. But that's not manifested in our P&L, yet, that's one for the Q3, Q4. So, there will be some benefits that starts wash through into Q3 and Q4 that we're not seeing it that's currently still in inventory. But on the efficiency side, we're really -- we will get there, but we're optimizing on delivery for the moment. But I think as we work through the fiscal, we'll be in a much better position to drive on efficiency measures.
Mick Farrell: I’d just pile on there that you look at Brett's guidance, nice conservative guidance is that our gross margin will be sort of steady as we go forward. I look on this and say, I think there's some upside. As we start to see mask rates start to improve, we saw 13% constant currency growth in masks during the quarter. I think, yes, as Brett said, the freight costs will wash through the inventory. And we're getting great scale from the biggest respiratory medical manufacturing plant in the planet, there in Singapore and the efficiency we've got a well above any competitor and we're doing really well on that and I think that'll come through. And then in addition to that, you'll get some upside from MEDIFOX DAN, which is accretive to revenue, gross margin, and EPS, as Brett said, throughout fiscal and beyond. So, that would be my guidance there as well, Steve. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Yes, thanks very much. Morning Mick and Brett. Just got a question on new patient growth. Just thinking about patients who have been prescribed the device and waiting and also those yet to be diagnosed, just wondering if you could compare and contrast the US and rest of world? And then some comments on what you think it means for industry device growth for fiscal 2023 and 2024 relative to our historical growth rates?
Mick Farrell: David, that's a great question. It's actually the answer. We could take the whole rest of the Q&A session to go through it because it's what we do is trying to reach out to the 936 million people in our core market that suffocate every night with sleep apnea around the world and we're laser-focused on it. As you saw, we delivered very strongly on those new patient setups 41% growth of devices in US, Canada, Latin America and we turned to positive there in Europe, Asia, and other. And what I can tell you is we're really working through that excess patient demand. Those numbers will tell you we're working faster through that excess demand in the US and getting closer to a state you get a prescription and you'll get a device in days or weeks versus it gone up to months there at the peak of the crisis. And I think if you look across the other 140 countries we sell into, every country is different. We've got to get the regulatory approval for AirSense 11 there. We've got to work our way through, but we're going step-by-step on that journey. And so as I look at this excess patient demand, I made the comment there in my prep remarks, I think we will get to all of our customers' demand before the end of this calendar year and that tells you our confidence in increased supply and our ability to meet that need, and we're laser-focused on that humanitarian emergency of patients waiting too long for therapy and we just don't want that you suffocate. This is a case of life and death; we've got the data to show that. We want your path to therapy to be expedited. And in addition to that, the final thing I'll say is that we are looking at our patient demand generation activities that have been on hold these last 18 months. And I'm looking at our models in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Japan, Singapore, UK, and beyond where we have these omnichannel markets availability to contact consumers or sleep concern consumers directly and get them into the funnel. And here in the US, we have direct models and also our joint venture there with Verily and Primasun that we've done some really good demand gen tests and a number of cities just waiting for me to fire the starting gun for that team. And we're getting very close to firing that starting gun. So, we have a smooth flow of -- from excess patient demand to now patient demand generation to continue our growth trajectory.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Mike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mick, I think you mentioned high flow therapy in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to get an update on kind of where things stand with commercializing that? And maybe talk about the -- just the market opportunity there? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question, Mike. And our long-term goals there in 2025, a number of those 250 million lives are going to change in 2025 will be patients with neuromuscular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And two of those great therapies, high flow therapy in the home, I want to be very specific, it's been used in the hospital during the pandemic. High flow therapy in the home, we see as a huge opportunity, probably 10 times the size of our ventilation market in COPD is available for home therapy, HFT therapy. And then Propeller, yes, early days and the pilots are going well. We're integrated to the payer provider EHR systems, which gives us the credibility now to go from pilots to start to scale some payer providers, particularly in the US geography. But Rob, any further details on our work on HFT and cloud connected inhalers for Mike there?
Rob Douglas: Yes, Mike. We're pretty excited about this. It's a long-term project though, but as Mick said, we view this as a very large potential market, very significantly larger than some of our other respiratory care markets. And we believe that we're running tests -- we're really focusing on its complementariness with home oxygen therapy that is you'll get much better outcomes if you add this in. And we're working hard on all of the market access and evidence generation programs to do that. Now, most of those programs are buying either RCTs or real-world evidence trials. So, we're sort of in limited market release at the moment in specific markets where we're making these claims. But as that evidence evolves and we generate it and take it to the -- to payers and standard setting organizations, we see this is going to be a very strong market for us, but it is a multiyear project.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.
Craig Wong-Pan: Thank you. Just a question on the SaaS business. The 7% organic growth that you mentioned, I was wondering if much of that was benefiting from price increases or if the price increases you started through the quarter have a bigger benefit to come through in future periods?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. No, that doesn't include a whole lot of price increases. In fact, we put price increases on hold during the COVID pandemic in some of our SaaS businesses and so we probably are changing to the area of price increases as we go forward. We've gone from pandemic to endemic, so that will happen and then flow out over the coming 12, 24 months. I'm really excited. We're looking at that domestic SaaS business in the worst of COVID getting down to low single-digits. We moved to mid-single-digits. And then Bobby, who's President of that division and his team have really accelerated that organic growth to 7% -- 8% last quarter, 7% this quarter, and so that high single-digits organic growth. And actually, we see upside from that in the organic, if you think about it, Brightree, MatrixCare, and Citus Health path. So, we see opportunities to move that up. And then when you add on MEDIFOX DAN and its capabilities, I think the combined business, obviously, the next four quarters, we'll call out the inorganic part will be double-digits on the inorganic, of course. But even going forward, as we look out towards 2025, we see opportunities for high single-digit and even low double-digit growth across that combined business as we lap the acquisition. So, really good growth there. Price increases will be a part of that going forward, but they weren't historically, to answer your question directly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Sean Laaman: Good morning Mick, hope you well. Mick my question is do you have enough visibility on the component pipeline to ascertain when you might be able to provide direct cloud connected devices in those markets that have an aversion to the Card-to-Cloud?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Sean, I hope your Sydney morning is going well day after Australia Day. Look, the way we're looking at this is we've got 140 countries. We've got a very complex supply logistics program to get the patients minimize the time from prescription to therapy across all those markets, but it's a complex equation. The good news is we are seeing supply of those rate limited semiconductors for communications. The 3G, 4G, 5G chips are starting to see supply come back. The microprocessors, the next rate limited step are starting to increase and so we're seeing our path through this. And you saw in the quarter, we were able to deliver incredibly strongly on that, and we're off allocation for the AirSense 10 100% connected. Look, I'd love to tell you, we've got a very complex jigsaw puzzle here. I'd love to tell you it will be off allocation on AirSense 11 in all of our markets. It's just not going to happen in the short-term. But as we go through this year, we'll update you as we go off allocation and it will happen market-by-market geography-by-geography. Rob, did I miss anything there?
Rob Douglas: The only other comment, Sean, is some of this is driven by regulatory requirements around getting approvals and validations and also, several of these markets have different components that they need. So, they're different validation and engineering projects to do it. And we just have to sequence that through our prioritization process as well. So, that's actually true with all product launches.
Mick Farrell: Yes, and the good news is it's not our first rodeo. We've done this launch platforms in 140 countries many times before, and we're back to our sort of meat and potatoes here. This is what we do all day every day. And going off supply chain constraints over the calendar year will be fantastic for us to be able to then just go back to what we do, which is helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside hospital care. Thanks for the question Sean.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning to Brett. I wanted to follow-up on the growth drivers as we think about this and next year, because I'm hearing there's patient backlog, obviously, there's core market demand generation that will start to pick up. And then from our perspective, we look at RePAPs as well. So, how do you layer those together over what time period? How much growth could you handle? And then maybe specific to RePAPs, since we haven't talked that much about them on this call, where have they been in the last two years? And when should they return to be a bigger piece of the mix itself? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Margaret. It's a great question and it's one we're thinking about a lot here. And we're thinking about all three prongs that you talked about. The first one, excess patient demand, how do we work through that. US, we're getting close to really working through it. We've got 140 other countries. And to Rob's point, it's a complex equation to get the supply chain and deliver in all 140, but we're working through that. Secondly, demand generation, yes, where we have omnichannel and have really established social media presences and abilities to drive demand gen, we'll be starting to turn those on country-by-country. And then thirdly, RePAPs, to your point, the last two and a half, three years of COVID crisis, pandemic crisis, competitor recall crisis, we have not turned the knob on RePAP. And in fact, we know our customers have been holding back when they're supply chain constrained on contacting patients who reach that three-year, five-year post-warranty, you're ready for a new device on insurance and/or patient making the call. So, I think all three of those are going to be applied in all 50 states here in the US and in all 140 countries worldwide. We do have scenarios and plans, I'm not going to detail them here on this call, but I can tell you that we expect to see steady growth throughout our market and we're going to drive that. And we're going to make sure that patients waiting lists are not long. We're not going to turn the needles until we're ready to get there in supply. I'm just happy we're having this conversation this quarter and it's so much better than the last eight quarters that we're talking about demand gen and driving RePAPs, because that's what we've done for 33.5 years in the business and it's what we love doing and we're going to do more of it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Matt Taylor: Great. Thank you for taking the question and good morning and good evening. I had a follow-up on that question. I guess I just wanted to understand what are your expectations if and when your competitor does come back? I mean, presumably, there could be some, I guess, impact on flow gens that would create pressure, but maybe you get some pickup in the mask. Could you characterize how quickly you would expect things to change dynamically in both directions? And then how much juice can you actually get out of the demand creation and ReSupply to backfill or you, kind of, increase growth? What are your pilot programs or places where you've done that telling you about how much of a quantitative pickup you can get?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question Matt. I'll start and hand to Rob for further detail because it is a really important area for us. Look, if you think about -- our competitor has been out on the market for 18 months and who knows. They've got to -- we'll find out probably later this week, they got an earnings call, maybe they'll tell us what's happened at the consent decree and give us some timing. Frankly, give the market some time it'd be good. We've run scenarios, they come back Monday February 1, July 1, we've also run scenarios that it's January 1, 2024. And actually, in all those scenarios, ResMed grows and ResMed does really well, and ResMed does a really good job of taking care of the unmet patient need. So, if they come back earlier, come back Monday, we get a 60% plus or minus attach rate of our masks. So, we get good GM contribution, great patient care in terms of the best masks in the planet going to them, and we're able to drive that. Now, they'll be starting from 0%, new patient share, they're going to able to go and fight account-by-account. And they won't be fighting against ResMed out the gate. They'll be fighting against the Tier 2, 3, and 4 players who have come in to fill that part of the equation and they're doing an okay job. And so they have to fight against the okay players. Then they have to fight against us, the market leader. But I look forward to them coming back actually in terms of the mask side of the business, it will be really good. The scenario where it's further out, it's later this calendar year or early next calendar year or beyond. We're okay with that too because we're ramping up our supply, and we're going to get closer and closer to meet all of customer demand in this. So, frankly, it's not irrelevant, but it's not a big perturbation of our long-term strategy and our long-term business. And we've got the scenarios and the little pivots that we need to have more masks or more demand gen in the different scenarios. So, I think investors and some analysts are thinking more about this -- are worried -- more worried about this than we are because we thought so much about it and have the scenarios and the playbook ready for all three of those scenarios and 2020 beyond. I look forward to this sort of people calling a binary. I see there's a mild perturbation of the Monte Carlo sim that really doesn't change in the long-term outcomes for ResMed and our patients is not changed in any of those scenarios. But Rob, any further detail for Matt here?
Rob Douglas: Yes, Matt the only other thing I'd add is we sort of think of sort of market growth rate in terms of the patient lifetime journey through this condition -- terrible condition, very serious and the biggest problem is awareness. And so you start off with how do you become aware of it. Does your primary care know to refer you to a sleep specialist? Can that specialist refer you to either home or lab testing? And then do you get a referral to a provider who's got the capacity to look after you. And basically, staff capacity is even a big issue for them. And so -- and then will that provide a look after long-term and keep the ReSupply programs. And our solutions are across all of those, but there's bottlenecks in all of those parts of the patient lifetime -- patient journey, if you like. And as I say, we're providing solutions across that and incrementally driving improvements across all of those. So, that provides a really good long-term outlook for steady growth in the business, as Mick was saying.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.
Michael Polark: Hey, good afternoon. Two quick ones if I can sneak them in. Is there a vision or strategy to convert Card-to-Cloud products to connected solutions over time? Or is the base case to lead those units that have gone into the market over the last year or so, as is? And then the second quick one is MEDIFOX DAN, the gross margin on that revenue ballpark, can you share what that is? Thank you so much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Mike and cheeky sneaking in two questions, but I'll answer both for sure. Card-to-Cloud, as those devices -- as those AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud devices reach their either warranty period or payer allotted period at which a patient can get another device allocated to them, which is usually in the three years or five years, normally time horizon, those patients will get the opportunity to upgrade their devices from an AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud to presumably an AirSense 11 device. And look, the first 26 years of ResMed's existence, we had, firstly, non-connected and then Card-to-Cloud pager-type technologies sort of sneaker-net. It works. It can get you there. It's not as optimal. It doesn’t get that sort of patient engagement on myAir and all the abilities that we can get to that 87% adherence, but it's darn good therapy. It's the smallest, quietest, the most comfortable therapy. And with the Card-to-Cloud, our HME -- mostly sold in the US, HME customers have done this for years and the data go to the cloud, and so the doctor doesn't see much difference because the doctor is seeing all the data in AirView on Card-to-Cloud and directly connected and so actually able to drive really good care with those patients. So, it will be a bolus of patients over that sort of 12-month period. And we've had, I would say, some pretty good success in humanitarian aid really and showing that ResMed isn't just going to stick to a strategy. It's going to say, if we need to pivot tactically to take care of patients, we'll do it and we'll take care of them long-term. But there will be a bolus of patients, I think, jumping at the front of RePAP in a couple of years who want to get the latest and greatest technology and some on consumer pay markets might go quicker. The second question around gross margin. Yes, look, MEDIFOX DAN accretive to our group gross margin. I'm not going to quantify it exactly, but that's why I said you're going to see, I think, some upside to our GM as we go through the fiscal year, including MEDIFOX DAN. It's accretive to revenue, gross margin percentage, but also NOP dollars and our EPS performance over the fiscal and beyond. Thanks for the questions Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Good afternoon and good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just a quick one. Just the US flow generator growth rate of 41%, obviously, very strong. Just wondering if you can give us any color as to within that, how much was volume versus price and also mix?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Saul, look, it's a great question. We don't split out our details on price. But I can give some sort of general color and maybe, Rob, Brett, maybe you want to add a little bit on for Saul to the color that we can provide. Competitive dynamics are very tight. Look, we were very open that we had a surcharge that we put the start of last year around the freight costs that were incredibly high, $12 and EUR12 across all devices and so on. We will start to actually take that away to get customer-by-customer and appropriately as we go through the year. And as we actually see -- to Rob's point earlier, as we see those freight costs come through our inventory, they don't just come in a spot change, it takes time for the COGS reduction there to come through. But in terms of that 41%, I can say it was materially improved by the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud and was able to get those devices there. But our ability, I think, also as we have started this quarter to turn AirSense 10 fully connected off-constraint, I think will continue to be a nice tailwind for our business there. But Brett, I'll hand to you for any further color we can provide to Saul to help on his modeling on this great US flow generator growth.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks Mick. I mean the only thing I'd add, Saul, is that we -- it was really the sleep devices or APAP devices are really strong as we got device availability that went straight into the market. So, that was really kind of driving that, which is obviously higher volume devices than, say, bi-levels, for example. So, that did definitely play a big part in that revenue growth.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks so much. Just a quick one. Mick you talked about being unconstrained on supply by the end of the calendar year and then I think to Sean's question, you talked about different markets and regulatory approvals. So, the question I've got is will the AirSense 11 be unconstrained more quickly in the US? And can you give us any sort of sense as to when you expect that will be the case?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question David. Yes, clearly, AirSense 10 fully connected will be unconstrained first just because that platform has been in the market for a long period of time. We've got all the inventory, all the capabilities to drive it, and it's regulatory approved in virtually every market, 140 around the world. And so it's just much easier to turn that off-constraint and get it moving first. But yes, to your point, the smaller, the quieter, the more comfortable and the most connected and most clever device is the AirSense 11. As we get regulatory approvals and we're going country-by-country on this. As we said, we just got Japan during the last quarter and we're going to go country-by-country on this, when we get regulatory approvals and as we get supply starting to improve on those components, we can really ramp that up with all its great technology and really good cost advantages and patient-friendly advantages. It's got coaching capabilities and interaction with the patient on the screen that's interactive and can do some really good over-the-air upgrades, but also over-the-air interactions with physicians and its connectivity to myAir, 55%. I mean almost vast majority of patients are being offered and almost for all them are saying, yes, I want to see my data every day and get a myAir score. So, it will go faster and less constrained in those markets where it has approval. I'm not going to predict the exact date that that will happen because we've got scenarios around that. But I think we will start to see that go off-constraints before the end of the calendar year because that's when we're going to be able to meet all the customer demand, which is our goal and with on a fast-track to do it this calendar year. Rob, what did I miss there on David's question?
Rob Douglas: The only other thing is, David, it's been really important for us to be able to supply those two platforms. It's been a great thing for us to have sort of a double. Basically, we've got so much extra capability and capacity because we've got two platform lines designed for the market.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Macquarie -- I'm sorry Marquee. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Look, it's pretty clear that a lot of the growth is now coming from products that have been reengineered and didn't really even exist in their current form a little while ago. So, -- and we've seen AirSense 10 connected as you're talking about launch with different parts and alternate supplies and so forth. But we've also seen some early regulatory approvals for an AirSense 11 with apparently different communication chipset. Is there any reason why that product couldn’t launch within the next few months as you've seen roughly the same time line between approval and launch for something like the AirSense 10 connected?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Dan. And clearly, you're very diligent looking at FDA and different regulatory approvals around the world. Look, what I'll say to this is that the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud was a reengineered re-pivoted device, absolutely. And the AirSense 10 fully connected, we did rejig the comms chip to get one that was less supply chain constraints. So, those two are reengineering back in the line. We didn't reengineer the AirSense 11 that's selling right now. But of course, there will be variance. This is a long-term platform. This platform, the AirSense 11 is going to do CPAP, APAP, bi-level, all sorts of amazing therapy models. If you even look at the work that we're doing on the Lumis HFT device that we talked about earlier in the Q&A and during my prep remarks, that's on a platform of the AirSense 10 and obviously, AirSense 11 will become the platform of note for us over the coming years. But we don't go into details of our future product pipeline. So, thanks for the question. But look, I can tell you, those three products in the market are number one, two, and three and as you saw this quarter, they're selling well, and we expect them to continue to.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning all. I might just come back to that full customer demand comment by the end of calendar 2023. Mick, is that in relation to just the new starts? Or do you also expect that you'll meet the demand for the backlog of RePAPs as well that we've had over the last few years?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Lyanne, you're getting to some of the complexities behind that. Look, our goal is to get off the supply constraint during this calendar and we know we can get there. We won't get there if we turn on every single knob that we have for demand generation and RePAP generation around the world. And so we will be turning those dials, if you like, for demand generation and RePAP generation through our customers and directly as we get supply improving country-by-country. And so yes, I think we can get to all customer demand if we do no change faster, but our goal is to take care of not just the patients who are currently in the pipeline, but also the 80% -- 90% in many countries who are undiagnosed and untreated. And so our mission is to do that and it's aligned with altruism but also our profit motive. And the overlap of those is a really powerful tool for us to have sustainable long-term growth as we have the last 33.5 years. And so clearly, if we turn every dial to max, we wouldn't be able to get off a constraint this year. We won't turn all to max, but we will and we are starting to turn those dials and getting the programs up and running in different cities, different states, different geographies around the world as we start to get off-constraint. So, I won't go into further detail than that to say that, Lyanne, yes, you're digging in, it is more complex than just we get there. It's we get there and then we start turning on the market growth rate as the market leader, which is our sort of our duty and our obligation and we're going to do both. We're going to grow the market and grow our share and deliver for patients.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen, it’s a follow-up from Jarden. Please go ahead.
Steve Wheen: Yes, thanks for taking my question. This question is about the diagnosis rate in the US, in particular, for OSA. There has been some frustration to the ability to diagnose patients. So, I just wonder what you're seeing from -- during the quarter from an improvement on that front with regard to diagnosis?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Steve, thanks and thanks for coming for your second question at the end of the queue. It shows that the system works and you can get the second question in. It's a good one. Our diagnosis rate in the US, obviously, impacted the start of COVID with all the labs being shut down and then we saw that big pivot and adoption of home sleep apnea testing and some great models from ResMed and many other players in the market to help physicians find ways to remotely screen, diagnose, treat, and manage sleep apnea patients. As we come out from pandemic to endemic in the US, we've definitely seen -- I'd say, our data show that at least 50% of patients are going through home sleep apnea testing. And then of the other 50%, some of them do home sleep apnea test and then just a follow-up in a lab for titration and mask fit and so on. And so really good adoption of home sleep apnea testing. It's sort of related to our demand generation area that demand generation isn't just going out there on social media and advertising and finding that customer acquisition cost and appropriate place well under lifetime value and getting them into the channel. It's also working with the channel to understand where we have capacity, what cities, what geographies that we have. And as you know, Steve following us closely, we purchased a company called Ectosense, and their product called NightOwl. And I have one sitting on the desk right here. This thing is the size of my fingertip and it has the ability to have highly sensitive and specific screening and diagnosis of sleep apnea with reimbursement in a geography like the US, and we're actually experimenting in Asia and Latin America and around the world on this. And the technology is originally European, so hopefully, it gets adopted there, too. I love Ectosense, and I love home sleep apnea testing happening where it's small, it's quiet, it's convenient, and its cloud connected similar to our therapeutics. And yes, so I think you're going to see that diagnostic rate in the US pick up post-pandemic because people learned that telemedicine, digital health, remote screening, remote diagnostics work, and we can scale them. But it won't just be here in the US. It might be pioneered, launched here, and scaled here. but it's going to work in many other countries around the world. And I can tell you we're really excited about partnerships with the physicians and the patients themselves to find their path to better sleep and better breathing. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further or closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Kevin and thank you again to all of our shareholders and stakeholders for joining us on this call. I'd want to thank once again the opportunity for all 10,000 ResMedians, many of whom of you are also shareholders. So, thank you for that. Thank you also for your dedication, hard work, helping people breathe, sleep, and live better lives in over 140 countries. You delivered these numbers. Thank you for all that you do. And I'll hand back to you, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Mick and thanks everyone for joining us. We appreciate your interest and your time. And as always, if you have any additional questions or need to follow-up, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude ResMed's second quarter 2023 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ResMed First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of their earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. Joining me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Mick will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. He'll review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals and discuss the current state of things as we continue to navigate the ongoing macro industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then review our financial results in more detail. And finally, we'll move into the Q&A portion of our call. During the Q&A session, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During our call today, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include some forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2023. These financial results demonstrate solid performance across our entire business, driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as well as ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices and mask systems worldwide. Achieving these numbers hasn't been easy given supply chain constraints, but we are powering ahead focused on the long term. Of course, we see the same macroeconomic challenges that many other industries are also facing as well as an industry-specific issue of a competitor-driven supply-demand imbalance the past 18-plus months, resulting in excess demand for our products. The good news is this. Our global ResMed team demonstrates over and over again their incredible ability to pivot and to solve problems, to support customers and to meet the needs of people around the world with market-leading therapies and software solutions. We are building on the success we achieved last quarter with our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device. Customer acceptance has been strong, particularly in the United States region, and this has enabled us to substantially increase shipping volumes to support patient demand while we continue to fight through global supply chain challenges. It is interesting to note that outside the U.S., we are not seeing the same magnitude of adoption of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device as we are in the U.S. This is due to the fact that our 100% cloud connectable platforms, such as AirSense 11 and others, and our ecosystem of software solutions are so embedded into the workflows of health care systems. This is particularly evident in countries where we have partnered to develop digital health reimbursement models. Customers in countries such as France and Japan and beyond, prefer to work with the limited product flow of our 100% cloud connectable devices rather than change their workflows for Card-to-Cloud models. While this means that some patients will have longer wait times in these regions, it does show the power of our long-term digital health strategy, lowering labor costs, improving efficiency and improving patient outcomes are just too hard to switch from. Nevertheless, on a global basis, the redesign and launch of the Card-to-Cloud device have greatly improved our ability to get closer to meeting the incredible demand in the market. AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud provided meaningful growth for the quarter. And far more importantly, it meant that patients could get access to a world-leading ResMed device to treat their sleep apnea. Clearly, launching this platform to address the spiking demand was and is the right decision. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, obesity, hypoventilation syndrome, asthma and all those who need access to our out-of-hospital health care systems. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. We continue partnering with our global supply chain to increase access to the critical components that are needed to accelerate production of our medical devices. Last month, I had the opportunity to fly to Sydney and meet many of our supplier partners in person for the first time in 3 years at our Star Supplier event in Sydney. Star is an annual celebration of our partnership with top suppliers. The event was also an opportunity to bring the ResMed story to life for our critical suppliers focusing on the life-saving importance of what we do every day. We showed our suppliers that increased component allocation for ResMed ultimately benefits patients, providers, physicians and all of our stakeholders worldwide. Supplier feedback from the Star event was overwhelmingly positive and many attendees commented how the event helped them to better understand our strong patient focus here at ResMed as well as our commitment to product quality and the patient-driven need for them to increase supply to ResMed. As a consequence of these partnerships, our suppliers are responding positively, and I can share this, we expect steady increase in ResMed's device production each quarter throughout this fiscal year and beyond. Let me now review updates on ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch and acceptance of our next-generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive, and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, more than -- it's more than doubled the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform, with over 60% of all patients downloading and using the app on AirSense 11. We know that patient engagement in their therapy through myAir is an incredibly important part of the therapy process and the ongoing compliance ecosystem due to our clinical publications in the area. Published real-world evidence data show that we achieved 87% adherence rates when our full tech stack is used, including both myAir and AirView. Clearly, increasing production of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed, and we are doing that every quarter. Additionally, we look forward to continuing to expand AirSense 11 into additional countries as we progress throughout fiscal year 2023 and as we continue to gain regulatory approvals country by country. A key part of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions as well as high flow therapy offerings. During the quarter, our ResMed team presented data at the European Respiratory Society Congress that the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD is much higher than previously estimated. The epidemiology data presented at ERS showed that over 480 million people worldwide have COPD. This is 100 million more than previously published data. As the global population continues to grow and age, we estimate that over 590 million people will have COPD by 2050. This represents a 23% relative increase in global COPD numbers from the baseline of 2020. Combined with the estimated 330 million people worldwide that suffer from asthma, these prevalence figures highlight the importance of treating these chronic conditions with our respiratory care solutions. Turning to our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care, our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year. The continued trend to move to lower cost and lower acuity locations for care is driving strong growth of home-based care. This is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health software platforms provided under our Brightree brand. We continue to grow with our home care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize their own business efficiencies as well as patient care, including specifically our Snap resupply offering. Census growth in skilled nursing as well as hospice is still challenged by post-COVID patient flow recovery as well as labor shortages. One of our most innovative solutions in this space under our MatrixCare brand has been technology solutions to improve staffing efficiency, improving both staff hiring and management. As post-COVID patient census continues to improve and pent-up demand for technology investments continues to come to the market, we expect to see even more growth opportunities to sell our services and solutions to new and existing skilled nursing and hospice customers. Last quarter, I discussed our agreement to acquire MediFoxDarn, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We are on track to close this acquisition before the end of the calendar year. This current quarter, we're in December 2022. And we remain excited about our opportunity to accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business outside the U.S., and we look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the year ahead. Our integration team is primed and ready. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMed's growth and complements the incredible software and device solutions we have in our core sleep and respiratory care businesses. We see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe this is the future of health care delivery, and ResMed is the right strategic home for these growth businesses. We are well positioned as the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we have created differentiated value for our customers and long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. Bringing it all together, we are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. We now have over 12.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 18.5 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating these data to the cloud, and we're unlocking value for patients, for providers, for physicians, for payers and for entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over this last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 144 million lives with our device platforms, our full mask systems and our software solutions in digital health. We're helping people sleep better, helping people breathe better and helping people live higher quality and happier lives with care delivered right where they live. So before I hand over the call to Brett fee's remarks, I want to once again express my gratitude to more than 8,600 ResMedians for their perseverance, their hard work and their dedication today and every day. Thank you. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks, and then we will open up to Q&A with Brett, me and again. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q1 despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints. Group revenue for the September quarter was $950 million, an increase of 5%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable supply chain environment. This gives us confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets decreased by 6% in constant currency terms. By product segment, globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Breaking it down by regional areas. Device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 23%, as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of our Card-to-Cloud device. Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 10% in constant currency terms, mainly as a result of the ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components for connected devices and lower sales of higher acuity devices relative to the strong sales we experienced in the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 3% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 9% in the September quarter. We saw particularly strong performance from the HME vertical as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 57.6% in the September quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to increases in average selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. SG&A expenses for the first quarter increased by 10% or in constant currency terms increased by 16%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and a post-COVID normalization of travel and entertainment expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to the 19.5% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 5% or in constant currency terms, increased by 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth and improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 19.8% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter was $222 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51, both consistent with the same period in the prior year. Note year-on-year movements in foreign currencies negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 this quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $36 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $64 million. We recorded equity losses of $2 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $207 million. At September 30, we had $795 million in gross debt and $588 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. At September 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. As reported last quarter, we expect to close on the MedifoxDarn acquisition by the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Additionally, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to further deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to call you back on to the call and turn it over to you to provide the instructions and run the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live. 
Steve Wheen: Just looking at working capital, this one for Brett. We saw the levels of inventory continue to increase. Just wondering how you're going to think about managing Card-to-Cloud inventory levels at a time or as your supply chain starts to free up a little bit more to allow you to make more AirSense 11. Just trying to work out whether there's any risk around inventory obsolescence as you try and transition back towards your latest platform?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Steve, I think at the moment, the market is very much characterized by really excess demand. So we're still trying to meet that, and I think that's going to be with us for a while. So we're building inventory really looking at that kind of future production that we're looking to manufacture. And then we'll manage -- we've introduced Card-to-Cloud, been very successful, particularly in the U.S. market. So that's part of our portfolio. It's important. But we certainly have the plans where I think we can manage that transition between Card-to-Cloud and connected devices as we get more of those components in. So I think it will be kind of a managed plan that will move from manufacturing the Card-to-Cloud to more connected devices as the electronic components come in. But we've got -- we have plans in place to do that and make that transition.
Mick Farrell: If I could, Steve, just to add that inventory build that we've had is really a deliberate outcome of our strategy around managing the supply constraints where we've had to really build up the materials components inventories for everything so that we could build the maximum when we break through the bottlenecks on the specific components. And then as the supply chain situation improves into the future, we'll be able to wind back from that.
Operator: Next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Matt Mishan: Just a follow-up on the mask growth. I think you said at one point in the call, that mask growth is still being affected by the lower patient setups. I mean with Card-to-Cloud, was that an OUS comment, a global comment or is that still an issue with the U.S. where we're still below the patient setup?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I mean if you look at the mask growth numbers in the quarter, we saw 11% growth in U.S., Canada and Latin America. So really strong double-digit growth there and 3% in Europe, Asia and Rest of World with a total global growth of 8%. 2019, we talked about market growth being mid-single digits for devices and high single digits for masks. So we're right there at 8% total growth. But I actually think we could be higher than that if we -- we're taking care of every new patient that's out there. As we said and as I said in the prep remarks, with our competitor out of the market these last 12, 15 months, at least can be 18 months, maybe 24 months out of the market in total. They were the number two player. And we are the number one player, and we're taking as much of the number two excess demand as we can. But we're not getting all of it. Still, even with Card-to-Cloud in the quarter, we weren't getting to every patient that needed a device. And so that delta is what we're talking about, that mask growth could have been even higher. But to your point, because Card-to-Cloud acceptance was so much better in the U.S., we did get better mask growth there. We saw 11% growth in the quarter and very strong. Yes, Card-to-Cloud, as I said in the prep remarks, not being taken up in countries where the whole reimbursement model has changed around digital health and cloud-connected devices such as France and Japan. And it's just structurally difficult, and they don't want to switch from the great efficiencies and outcomes that we get with our 100% cloud connectable systems. So that's sort of the nuance around that. What it talks to is an opportunity to continue to grow our device business, but to even further increase our mask growth, not only in the US, but also in Europe, Asia and Rest of World. Thanks for the question, Matt.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse.
Gretel Janu: So how are you allocating your iron here between U.S. and rest of world, given that the U.S. is adopting the Card-to-Cloud. So are you giving greater levels to rest of world relative to what you historically have the mix between the 2 regions?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Gretel, it's a great question. It's a very complex one. And we've actually established during the COVID crisis on ventilators, we established a global epidemiology model, a humanitarian-based epidemiology model where we really looked at the flow of the virus around the world and where we should allocate limited supply of ventilators for that. And I think we did a really good job in that crisis of 2020. We applied those same skills really these last 12, 15 months of having a global team looking at the 140 countries we operate in, looking on a humanitarian basis, as the needs for people who are suffocating now in our core market, suffocating with sleep apnea and other -- on the AirSense 10 platform, we do have other respiratory care and respiratory insufficiency capabilities as well and the AirSense 10 connected devices on bio levels. So we have a global model. We look at allocations based on the demand on patients and the need to get them there. It's a complex and moving dynamic equation. The latest moving apart in it is that AirSense Card-to-Cloud has been coming out the gate incredibly strongly in the June quarter. We talked about 90 days ago and here in the September quarter, and we expect that to continue. That may mean increasing some AirSense 11 allocation to places like France or Japan, where they aren't seeing the same adoption due to the changes there. So it's an ongoing dynamic thing that we look at daily, weekly, monthly in our production, shipping and delivery schedules. So it's not a simple equation. But yes, the impetus of your question was would we look to the humanitarian need and do our best to make sure that device gets to a patient fairly, and that's exactly what we're trying to do on a global basis. It's not simple. It's quite complex, but we're working at it every day. And the team is doing an incredible job, as you saw in these great growth numbers. Thanks for the question, Gretel.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey.
Saul Hadassin: Mick, we've seen a lot of data breaches in the last few weeks, including in the health care space. And on the basis of how much data you guys have access to, just wondering if this is caused you to have a look again about data accessibility and risks associated with potential data hacks and just what your thoughts is on -- thoughts are on the strength of protection that you have. How do you actually protect against something that is happening in the future?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So, it's a great question. And obviously, cybersecurity is something we think about all day and every day, and our Chief Information Security Officer and his team are what I would call productively paranoid about the 12.5 billion nights of data and the 18.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in 140 countries. And I did see the news in Australia of a number of health care system hacks. And we've had them here in the U.S. as well, United had one and a number of local health care systems have as well as some infrastructure areas. Look, it's a case of productive paranoia. You have to be investing in this space. You have to be looking at what happened doing root cause analysis of the hacks that have happened. In almost every case, it's been a human, a person clicking on something and giving allocation. And so we're looking very carefully at our training and holding back systems from -- and fixing systems where there are weak links and making sure that all day, every day, you're looking at this because, yes, people are out there. Initially, hackers went to consumer tech and fintech industries. As you said, health care is on their radar. We're probably third on the radar, but we're definitely there. And it's something that we think about and we invest a lot in our cybersecurity protections. But it's an ongoing game of investments and making sure that we stay at or ahead of the curve and how we work with our partners in the health care system to make sure that the data we look at privacy as well as cybersecurity and interoperability. Those 3 have to all be balanced, but cybersecurity is right there as one of our core competencies right now, and we invest a lot in that area. Thanks for the question, Saul.
Operator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee.
Dan Hurren: Look, I just want to ask about seafreight method. You previously talked about some degree of inventory builds that may shift away from airfreight and had to seafreight. And we've seen other mass participants already do that to sell the group want to ask where you are on that transition and what sort of impact it has on margins.
Mick Farrell: Brett, do you want to have a go on that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Sure. Yes. Dan, Yes. I mean we've moved -- we were almost exclusive are. We've moved some to sea freight. And so that's happening. It's probably -- it's progressive and probably measured because we still want to get inventory to our DCs and then obviously on patients. So we're just trying to balance that. But we have started progressing that to sea freight. So that's happening. Again, we're probably seeing -- we're seeing a little bit of relief or moderation in those kind of freight rates that are coming through. It will take a little bit of time for that to wash through for us. But I still think in the second half, we'll start to see some benefit from some kind of overall freight costs coming down relative to last year.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham.
Mike Matson: Yes. I guess just on the international side of the business was quite a bit weaker than the North American side. And I think you commented on the Card-to-Cloud not seeing as much uptake, but I just wanted to see if that was really the primary issue there. Was there anything else going on? Any kind of economic challenges in any of the OUS markets?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. And really, truly, the major component is getting Card-to-Cloud in those areas. If Card-to-Cloud had the same adoption in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World as it did within the U.S., Canada, we would be seeing significantly higher device growth numbers. And so that's -- it's item number one on how we can address that. And actually, in countries where there's no reimbursement models and others, we are pushing towards those Card-to-Cloud as well as increasing, as I said earlier, to Gretel's question, the flow of AirSense 11. One other thing that Brett did note in his prepared remarks was that this quarter a year ago, Europe saw very high sales of ventilators. Some of that was in the COVID space and in the response to some recalls from a competitor space around ventilators in Europe where ventilators, respiratory care is a larger portion of our European business than it is in the U.S. And so that was in the comp on the other side. So those are the 2 main factors that were there. Card-to-Cloud adoption and year-on-year with regard to our noninvasive ventilation, life support ventilation and whole respiratory care business, if you like, in Europe was just a bigger portion of the business there. But thanks for the question, Mike.
Operator: Next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.
David Bailey: Yes. But you sort of mentioned some of the constraints to set up from component shortages in a competitor recall. Just interested in your thoughts on that patient backlog. If you've got any estimates as to how many patients do you think could be waiting for a device, how long it will take to work through? And what that might mean for industry growth relative to that mid-single-digit number you sort of talked to previously.
Mick Farrell: Well, look, I'll have a go at that first, David. Thanks for the question. Brett, please and Rob and Dave power on. Look, there's excess demand that's out there with your number two player in a highly competitive market being out of the market for 15 months now, and they say they may be back in January, but I'm not optimistic that they'll actually be back given all the issues that are there for them. And so we look at that and say, let's do as much as we can towards this. We know we are not getting there. When we know the size of the market, we know the total flow of patients. We know what our number one share was, how it's grown, and we're taking care of all of that. We know what their number two share was and how that's grown, and we know we're taking a high double-digit percentage of that, but not all of it. We're not at 100% of it. And so we know there's that gap to fill, which is excess demand. Yes, it does build up to a pipeline -- a great pipeline of patients that are out there. But on the downside, it's tough for those patients because wait times go from days and weeks to weeks and months and from months to quarters in some regions. And so that's why we are and have pivoted for this redesign and reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. It's why we are redesigning parts and pieces within our AirSense 11 and our AirSense 10 connected devices. And we're ramping up all 3 of those. So if you put it together, we have the number one product in the market, the best product, which is the AirSense 11. We then have the number two best product, which is the AirSense 10 fully connected. And we have the number three best device, which is the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud. And we're selling all three and ramping up all the throughout our Sydney, our Singapore, Atlanta and European distribution centers. And so we're doing the best we can. It'd be very difficult. I mean we do have a lot of quantification on it, competitive reasons, I don't want to go out to exactly what we're looking at. But the timing of how we feel it is dependent upon how fast we get the components and parts and pieces into our Singapore plant and beyond. And those every day, they get better. I said in the prep remarks, that every quarter this year, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, we're going to make more and more of the AirSense 11. You've seen that. We delivered in June. We delivered in September. We will deliver again in December. We'll deliver again in March '23. We'll deliver again in June '23. And so every quarter, we'll give you the update on it. But I almost don't want to quantify it on a time basis because we know what it is on a device basis, I want the time to get shorter and shorter as ResMed accelerates faster and faster towards getting that excess demand and making sure our supply can get us close to meeting it. And then when we meet it, we can then get back to a balanced inventory situation.
Operator: Next question is coming from Matt Taylor from Jeffries.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Zack on for Matt. I was just curious if you could give some color on supply chain improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis? And any color on how you can reach full capacity over the next couple of quarters.
Mick Farrell: Rob, do you want to have a go at that?
Rob Douglas: Sure. Thanks, Zach. Yes, Mick was talking before around the quarter-on-quarter, and we're talking device volumes there. And you heard Brett's earlier comment saying we're sort of seeing a stabilizing view of the supply chain. And what had happened in the past was that you think you had a plan, but then these decommits had come through. Now we're definitely seeing a big reduction in the rate of decommits. They're not fully gone. And so there is that sort of still some uncertainty in exactly which products we can deliver on what day because some of the commits can come at -- come out. Other things that are going to help us going forward is that the engineering projects that Mick talked about, including validating new component -- new communications modules. And recall, we're in an environment of the economy and consumer products. It looks like the demand, the excess demand of phones and those types of devices is moderating a bit. The excess demand that autos were creating isn't moderating as far as we can see, and that's still very significant. And in fact, the technologies that we use are more likely to be the types of things in autos than in phone. So there is still some sort of industry pressure on the chip components, but as our engineering projects develop and we get more options validated, we have more likelihood of increasing that volume. And so what we're saying is we're actually producing a huge amount more devices now than we were, say, before the pandemic or even before the competitive recall happened. And our plans, if we can follow it, you can see in our inventories, we've got the parts for it. If we get the final parts in, we'll absolutely keep driving these volumes. And there's risk to the upside. We haven't completely eliminated risk to the downside but we're pretty confident that we're in good shape.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America.
Lyanne Harrison: Just following on the question about how long your competitor might be out of the market. Is that gets delayed or pushed out up to 24 months. Do you think ResMed will be -- have enough production volume as we think about third quarter fiscal and fourth quarter fiscal, enough volume to meet the gap that Phillips has left? And then also, last quarter, you also spoke about some of your demand generation initiatives. Are you at a point now in terms of your visibility on production that you're implementing some of those demand generation initiatives?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne. It's a really good question with sort of 2 elements to it. One, that's difficult for me to determine because it requires knowledge of the US government from FDA and DOJ and a consent degree with a competitor that I'm not involved in those conversations. I see what we all see publicly out there. And so how long our competitor will be out, we don't know. But we run scenarios on that, right, but they'll come back in January, they come back in July, they'll come back later than that in 2023. And as I look at that, I think about our ability and what we can do in every quarter, we're going to increase production of AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud, AirSense 10 coms, AirSense 11 cons. And so if I track those lines up and move them up, there are scenarios where we can get to the full industry demand in calendar year 2023. A lot of things have to come together for that to happen. And there's a lot of scenarios, as Rob said, around parts and pieces coming in and on the other side. But we're doing everything we can to get closer and closer to that. So yes, we can strive towards it, and we're going to move towards it. And we want no patient left behind. We want anyone who suffocates and gets a prescription to have a short wait time no matter what country they're in to a ResMed device and we're doing everything we can to keep up with that excess demand. It will be there for the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. But as you start to look through 2023, I think, yes, potentially the supply and demand curves could cross over for us and the other players in the industry as well. So how long -- there's a number of scenarios around that, as I discussed. Second part of your question, demand gen initiatives. Yes, we have some really exciting demand gen initiatives from our Asia, Latin America team, the work that we're doing in China and in India and Brazil. These huge population markets to look at different methods of getting to patients and ensuring that care is delivered across socioeconomic bounds and there's health equity and the delivery of our products in these high-growth markets or some really exciting things Justin Leon and his team are driving in our Asia, Latin America demand gen initiatives. And then here in the U.S. market, we've got some really exciting work in our joint venture with Verily called Primasun. I just ran into the CEO of Primasun there at the med tech conference this week in Boston. And there's some really exciting milestones that we'll be looking at throughout calendar year 2023 to drive demand gen to identify, engage and enroll patients. Actually, sleep concern consumers to a pathway to become patients. And so those will start to roll out during the year. In addition, our Western European and Northern European teams and our teams across the world have really exciting programs that, frankly, we've been experimenting and piloting on during the COVID crisis, the embracement of digital health, the embracement of respiratory health, the embracement of care delivered outside the home during the COVID crisis. And actually, during our competitive recall crisis, I think we've seen an ability for us to partner even more closely with our partners in the channel physicians and providers are willing to experiment even more. So I do expect us to turn on a number of these demand gen initiatives throughout calendar year 2023 as we start to get supply up to where demand is and then can drive core demand of the market back again through that demand gen. So great question, Lyanne, and thanks for that.
Operator: Next question is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC.
Craig Wong-Pan: Sorry about that. The -- I think there's been some changes with some of the expectations for cost loans like R&D, I think, is now let 6% to 7% of sales versus previously 7% to 8%. And then the Primasun joint ventures, the losses have increased as well. Could you just talk about what's led to those shifts in expectations?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure. I'll talk to...
Mick Farrell: Brett, I think that's a great question for you.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks. Yes. On the R&D, it's just uptick slightly lower. But a lot of that has to do with the weaker Australian dollar. As you know, we've got a decent amount of R&D undertaken here in Australia. So it kind of reflects the lower currency there, Craig. It's not -- it doesn't -- will still be have the same number of more people in R&D and working on that. But obviously, the translation impact is going to be felt as we forecast forward. So that's on the R&D side of things. And your other question?
Craig Wong-Pan: The Primasun joint venture has increased...
Brett Sandercock: Sort of Mick mentioned that some of the milestones, some of the activities that you're undertaking. So they will look to invest or fund more of those demand gen activities as they kind of move into a more commercializing phase. So that's going to uptick, I think, over the next few quarters. Our share of those costs essentially. So that's why I guided that to be a little bit higher over the next several quarters.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.
Chris Cooper: Can I ask one on the outlook for pricing? We heard some pockets of feedback late in the quarter that at least one of your competitors is beginning to price more aggressively on masks. Are you seeing that feed through yet? If you do sort of begin to see a more competitive price environment, how would you envisage responding to that?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Chris. And certainly, pricing is a big topic always in our industry over these last 12 months as inflation around the world has moved from low-single digits to mid-single digits to high-single digits in almost every country we're in, that we've started to respond to that. And as shipping costs have gone up, we've started to respond to that. As you know, at the start of this calendar year, we instituted some surcharges on products in the U.S. and on Europe for those extra costs that were associated with shipping. And then we have, as appropriate, working with customers and within the health care systems increased prices on specific parts and pieces where the costs for us have gone up. And so therefore, we're sharing some of that burden of increased costs with our channel. In terms of -- while appreciating your channel check in the conversation with a customer or 2, I -- we are not seeing across the board major changes in ASPs on either the device or the mask side. It's interesting to note that with our really strong growth of masks, they're 11% in the quarter in U.S., Canada and Latin America. That's in a market where there's no recall from anybody. That's just the standard competitive market, and ResMed is out there fighting for it even with the lower flow of new patients, as we talked about earlier, due to the fact that not every patient who needs a new setup is getting it even though the vast majority of those sales are repeat sales to customers already in our installed base of amazing people being treated every day by ResMed masks. So not a huge sort of impact on pricing right now. If anything, prices are stable to slightly up on devices, and I would say stable in the mask side sort of in line with where they have been. And so no major changes there. Obviously, we watch that. It's a dynamic approach, but we don't focus on price, we focus on value. We talk about how the first time fit with ResMed is where it's at and how the adherence rates are where they are and the mask league is much lower. And customers know that and they track that. And we give them data in our view in myAir and give them all analytics to know how well our masks are doing compared to the competitors. And that's why the doctors prescribe our masks and it's why the HMEs and home care providers around the world choose our masks. So we compete on value, not price. And we look forward to increase competition and increase growth in both the device and mask side. We love a competitive market, and we tend to win in it.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer.
Suraj Kalia: Perfect. So Mick, you mentioned about taking most of the excess demand share. Maybe if I could ask my question a little differently, Mick. So let's say we use three buckets. Patients either remain on Phillips, patients switched to ResMed or the third bucket that patients are left to find on their own, right? Let's just assume these 3 buckets. How would the pie charts of existing patients versus new patients coming into the funnel look like? Just trying to understand at a very simplistic level, where are we in the share transfer and what is happening to these patients?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I appreciate the angle you're coming out on it. Let me give you my thoughts on it and address your question from this angle. So I'll put it. I'll say there's 2 buckets. There's new patients and then there's patients getting what we call recap or a device that's 5 to 7 years old, let's say, it's out of warranty maybe, 3 to 5 years and they want to upgrade. And then there's a third bucket of patients who are part of the competitive recall. So the first bucket, which is new patients. Yes, look, there's ResMed and a bunch of small share players competing all day, every day for those new patients and incredible excess demand and every product we make, we can sell into that space. And we are doing very well and taking a lot of share, as you see in the numbers. 23% growth in devices in U.S., Canada, Latin America, 9% growth worldwide in that category of devices. So doing incredibly well in that new patient's bucket. If you look at the existing patients that are looking to retap, right, after three, five or seven years on therapy, I think some home care providers and HMEs in Europe and rest of the world won't be contacting those patients right now. They know the situation. They don't want to get somebody into the channel where the wait times are long. And so I think there's some opportunity for even further excess demand in that second bucket of existing patients looking to retap that haven't been turned on. It's another type of demand gen to Lyanne's question earlier that our channel probably is not turning on much and keeping that dial very low, except for those patients who come and say, "Look, I really need an upgrade, then they put them in the queue. That's the second bucket. The third bucket is the 5.5 million patients who are on a competitive device from the recall that was announced June a year ago. Our competitor, that's their duty and they are working through those. They're not there. They say they're maybe 3 million into the 5 million. I'm skeptical of that. I think they're talking about production numbers versus delivered numbers. As I look to the channels and speaking to people about how many of the devices that they've asked for have actually been received for as part of that recall. So that third bucket is tough. And so what does the patient do there? Do they just wait? Or do they go get a prescription and try to go spat.com or easybreathe.com or some other retail channel in a different market and try to come in and drive some excess demand that way. It's very hard to determine all of that. We do have some numbers around it. But that third bucket is really the duty of our competitor to take care of, and they're working their way through it. And it looks like it's 18 months through to December. If they get there by June next year, that's 24 months. I'd hope that they are at least there then and can come back. Again, as I said earlier, with the scenarios, we're looking at all sorts of scenarios. I want them back. I love the competitive game. I love beating them in the game of who's got the smallest quite most comfortable and most cloud-connected device that lowers costs and improves outcomes. And we were doing that in 2019. Actually, from the launch of AirSense 10 in 2014 to 2019 for 5 strong years, and I look forward to continuing to do that afterwards. But that's how I'd look at it. Three buckets, new patients are doing incredibly well. Repap, not really turning that dial right now, probably turn it on as we get demand gen. And the third one, yes, we will be getting some of that. We're not fighting for that because that's not where we want to play. That's a competitor's duty to take care of them. And we're focused for the long run. And the 1 billion people worldwide is suffocate who haven't yet been brought into the channel. That's the real opportunity. Thanks for the question, Suraj.
Operator: Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.
Margaret Kaczor: This is Maggie on for Margaret. I wanted to ask on the mass growth specifically and just trying to get a better picture of the resupply trend. So obviously, I can appreciate the amount of new patients coming on service. But maybe if you can kind of talk about the resupply trends and what you're seeing and what we can kind of expect for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Maggie. Look, it's a really good question around resupply. And as you know, looking at our SaaS business through Brightree resupply and Snap resupply, we have some really good models in our SaaS business that's truly the synergy between our SaaS business and our core sleep and Respiratory Care business. And we've got the back-end synergies around cyber securities we talked to earlier, cloud ops and interoperability, but the front-end synergies there around driving resupply have been really strong and Brightree resupply and Snap resupplier are a good part of driving that resupply revenue. Yes. Look, you saw 11% growth, right, in U.S., Canada and Latin America in those resupply. And the U.S. is primarily the market for that where there are very sophisticated models and a very strong incentive for both the patient, the provider and ResMed and actually the payer with the return that they get by reduced hospitalizations to ensure that patients continue to get new masks. Those systems are not quite as evolved or implemented within Europe, Middle East, Africa and Rest of World and so -- and Asia Pac. We do have models, particularly where we're working directly with providers and/or patients to drive resupply models and those are working well. But look, there's a -- I would say there's a lot of opportunity to drive resupply in Europe, middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. And if you look at Catherine Pucknat, and our team in Germany and what she's doing to engage with patients, you look at just in Lyon and what he's doing across Asia and Latin America to engage directly with patients and show them the path to get a fresh, clean new mask on a regular basis and become part of a subscription program for that. There's a lot of innovation to come. So look, I'm proud of the 8% growth in a tough environment with new patients coming in. I want that to get higher. And I certainly want Europe, Asia and Rest of World to go from low to mid- to high single digits again. And we will get there as that resupply and the new patient flow, both come to market. So a lot of moving pieces there, Maggie. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Mathieu Chevrier from Citi.
Mathieu Chevrier: Just a longer-term question. How do you see home testing and the Primasun JV impacting the longer-term growth rate of the industry?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question. home sleep apnea testing is now just part of the game. I think what happened during COVID is we were all forced to do telehealth, digital health and to embrace that across the 140 countries that we are in. And we've seen increased adoption rates of home sleep testing across the world. It's just really exciting. Look, if you look at France and Germany, France, it always adopted home sleep testing and very, very good rates of that. Germany really hadn't pre-COVID now has and the physicians have seen it the home care providers have seen it, and we're vertically integrating that market. So we're really driving the adoption if you look at Northern and Western Europe of home sleep testing. And I do think when and if -- I don't know when we get our supply up to where demand is, we can start to turn on those home sleep testing demand gen opportunities because, as I said earlier, 1 billion people suffocating worldwide. We've got less than 20% on treatment in the U.S., less than 10%, 15% in Europe and less than 5% in Asia, less than 1% in some of the high population countries. And so home sleep testing is a really interesting path for that. There were some really interesting sort of viral videos. Our India team is doing a great job. They've actually got an Indian rap star to talk about home sleep testing. We saw a huge spike in the response rate and people going through that. It's really interesting with relatively low cost. These pilots and experiments we're doing with not old schooled media buying a Super Bowl ad or buying an add on Champions League, European football. We're going down to social media levels and using, I would say, very strong interesting experiments around social media marketing to drive demand gen for home sleep testing. And if you ask a person, would they prefer to be tested for sleep apnea in their home or in a hospital, 80% of people say in the home. 20% really should always go to a hospital. They have a comorbidity, history of stroke, history of heart attack, COPD, some other comorbidity or some other sleep disorder. And there are 100 other sleep disorders other than sleep apnea. They're rare, but they're there. So we're going to ramp up home sleep testing in the U.S. with our Verily joint venture, but we're also going to do it directly with all of our home care partners across the U.S. and in the other 140 countries we do business in. So thanks a lot for the question. And I think that will be our last question. We're just running straight up. And one more question, maybe. Amy, what do you think?
Operator: Our final question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.
Steve Wheen: A little squeaking another one. I just wonder in response to the consent decree that Philips is in the process of negotiating. They've obviously done a very large impairment to the Respironics business. Do you have any sort of thoughts as to what they might be needing to contemplate as part of that, whether it impacts innovation, whether it impacts their ability to manufacture just if you had any high-level thoughts as to what you think that decree could look like?
Mick Farrell: That's a great question. I'll give some thoughts on hand to Dave Pendarvis, who's not only our Chief Administrative Officer, but also a lawyer and maybe we'll understand that. Look, you have to wait until these things come out. We haven't seen a public discussion of what the consent decree looks like. They're negotiating it now. So when that comes out, we'll look at it. What has been public is a number of responses on that 483 and really specifically talking about culture changes, management changes and a focus on quality. The reengineering and recultural training that, that type of change requires a lot of work. And I would think people will have to move from development and R&D back to what I would call quality remediation and quality systems improvement. So there will be some sort of quality debt, if you like, that would be needed to pay back if you just read through the public information on that 483. But Dave, what are your thoughts and perspective on this?
David Pendarvis: Yes, I think you've got it right, Mick. The -- there's a broad range of where this thing could land from sort of a watch and report on the one hand to almost closing down operations on the other end. And without being in the mix of either talking to the agency or talking to the company, which we can't do either one on this particular topic. It's hard to know where they're going to land in between there. But as Mick said, if you look at the public statements, which is both the 483 and also their proposal to take control of the recall, you can see the issues that the agency is concerned about. And so what they're going to want to do is get assurance that those issues are not going to put patients at risk in the future. You've got to have systems in place not only for the products that are issued now but for other products that may be out there on the market or be brought to the market in the future. So except for the agency, obviously, it's a consent decree for a reason. It means that there is an agreement between the parties as to what those parameters will be. And until they announce it, it's really tough to speculate on what the exact details will be. And as I said, there's a pretty broad range. Thanks.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 8,600 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives in residential medicine in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do. I look forward to talking with you all right here in 90 days. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-08-11 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2022 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings release and the presentation, both of which are available now. Joining me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session, and Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'll now go ahead and turn the call over to Mick.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today as we review the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended June 30. On today's call, I will provide a brief high-level overview of our financial results. I'll then review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, and then discuss our actions to navigate through ongoing industry and supply chain challenges. Brett will then join the call to review our financial results in more detail. Okay. Let's jump right in. Our fourth quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with high single-digit revenue growth in both our sleep and respiratory care business segment as well as in our Software-as-a-Service business segment. Our ongoing growth reflects our global team's relentless focus to solve very complex supply chain problems and find alternate design and engineering solutions to address the incredible industry challenges that we have faced over the past year and beyond. The global supply chain environment remains very much in flux across multiple industries. We are starting to see indications that the macro environment is improving, particularly semiconductor availability. However, we're mindful that even as macro trends start to improve, we still need our supplier partners to prioritize med tech component needs over other nonlife-sustaining industries. Demand in the market remains very strong. We've been able to mitigate some of the electronic component bottlenecks with the launch of our redesigned card to cloud AirSense 10 devices introduced to the market midway through our fourth quarter. As you can imagine, clearing one bottleneck simply brings the next rate-limiting step to the forefront. Our team is actively working to clear as many bottlenecks as they can as quickly as possible. On the positive news side, the redesign, reengineering and launch of the card to cloud device greatly improved our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in the marketplace. During the last month of the quarter, during June, we were able to allocate more products to our customers than in recent months and in recent quarters. We're not out of the woods yet, but the compass is pointing to true north and we are on top of it. Throughout this crisis of demand and supply, our established ResMed guiding principles remain the same: that is that we will give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest-acuity patients first. As we discussed last quarter, we are still facing a challenging freight environment. The key challenges of sea freight and airfreight are due to reduced availability and elevated prices. These forces are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into our factories and then to get the finished goods out of those factories and ship to warehouses and ultimately to customers. We continue to do everything that we can to secure additional supply to ultimately further increase production of our devices. As highlighted on previous calls, this includes a combination of 5 concurrent work streams in supply chain. One, we are locking in the flow of our existing parts from existing suppliers. Two, we are establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers. Three, we're validating and verifying new parts from existing suppliers. And four, we're validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers. And then finally, five, we're reengineering designs to mitigate the major supply bottlenecks. In summary, we're making good progress with these 5 lines of work, and we've been able to offset some of the impacts of the component shortages to best support patients, providers, physicians and beyond. In addition to the successful launch of our redesigned card to cloud device last quarter, we also continue to support our customers with our market-leading mask portfolio. The supply -- despite the challenges we faced with reduced new patient setups due to a competitor recall, we continue to see strong uptake of our mask solutions as our customers want the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the easiest to fit and the most highly patient-rated masks in the market, and those come from ResMed. Peer-reviewed and published studies have clearly shown that patients that are on a ReSupply program are much more likely to remain on sleep apnea treatment adherent for the long term than those that aren't on a ReSupply program. Our home care provider customers not only want to put new patients on therapy, they want to keep those new patients and all of their existing patients on therapy over the long term. And the ultimate goal there is to improve patient outcomes to lower total health care system costs as well as to drive their own recurring revenue streams. We recognize that this demand outstripping supply situation remains a very difficult temporary state for all customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems as well as the most important customer of all, the patient. We continue to work across the industry to be the best partner and the best solutions provider for all customers. We expect demand to be greater than supply for at least 12 more months, driven by the recall of one of our competitors primarily. The net result is that every device that we here at ResMed make during these next 12 months, we will sell as it leaves the production line to a warehouse and is shipped to a customer. We are looking at every angle to maximize supply and address this incredible demand these next 12 months. As a company, we are learning every day. And as an industry, we will get through this challenge stronger than ever. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, when they need it, and we won't stop until we achieve that goal. Let's now briefly review the COVID-related market impacts on our industry. Most of the 140 countries that we operate in are now above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. It is noted that in some regions and some countries, we see ongoing surges of new COVID variants with some select governments continuing to impose COVID restrictions. In these areas, patient flow remains below pre-COVID levels. But across the board, we are seeing ongoing adoption of digital health solutions for screening, for diagnosis and for remote patient setup and monitoring as well as well-established COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs and physician offices. These trends continue to minimize the impact of new variants and diminish the absolute impact of COVID on our industry over time. Let's now step back a little and review ResMed's top 3 strategic priorities: number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. The launch of our next-generation device platform called the AirSense 11 continues to go very well. It remains somewhat difficult to differentiate the success of the launch from previous generations with the incredibly high demand we're seeing around the world. Every Air 11 we make is sold immediately as it leaves the manufacturing floor. However, when we drill into patient feedback data, we see that patients are very excited about the platform, including the Air 11 device itself and the myAir software solutions surrounding it. During the fourth quarter, we introduced the AirSense 11 into several new countries outside the United States where we first launched the platform, including France, Switzerland and across the Nordic countries of Northern Europe. We look forward to further expansion into additional countries as we progress through our fiscal year 2023. One area that we are closely watching is patient adoption of digital health solutions. And to that point, adoption rates of the myAir app by new patients set up on therapy with the AirSense 11 continue to be more than double that of the AirSense 10. This is because the AirSense 11 platform is designed to enable and encourage patients to engage directly with their own health care. The bottom line is that people want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they love the coaching and personal engagement of our ecosystem. They are voting with their digital presence, and repeat usage of the myAir app is stronger than ever. More patients on myAir means more patients are fully engaging with ResMed's software technology. This has led us to now passing over 12 billion nights of sleep apnea and respiratory care medical data in the cloud. Our software solutions, including myAir and AirView, are delivering a better patient experience, better efficiencies for home care providers and physicians, and most importantly, greater long-term adherence to therapy for the patient. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health. For our industry, this is specifically seen in the increased usage of home-based sleep apnea tests. Although new patient demand gen is clearly not a top priority in the immediate term given the current supply-demand imbalance, we are maintaining our focus in this area and our long-term investments so that we are ready when conditions improve and we can pivot and fire up our portfolio of demand-gen models and thereby ensure sustainable long-term pipelines of new patients for our industry. With over 1 billion people suffocating every night with sleep apnea worldwide, we see this work as an opportunity, but also an obligation as the market leader in the field. We are innovating with health care system partners and all of our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnosis, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end-to-end, seamless, digital experience for patients and their caregivers. As we consider opportunities to address the wider sleep market, we are investing in opportunities to address another major sleep disorder epidemic, that of insomnia. Insomnia has been shown in clinical research to occur in combination with sleep apnea, and that's a deadly combination. To this medical need and this medical opportunity, just last week, we announced the acquisition of a company called mementor. This is a German and Swiss digital health start-up that develops and sells digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and beyond. mementor offers the first and so far the only permanently listed digital health application in the field of sleep medicine that is reimbursed by the statutory insurances in Germany. The acronym for these German digital health apps is DIGA, D-I-G-A. This acquisition furthers our efforts to diversify and accelerate growth of our ResMed business in Germany and the potential opportunity with DIGA to expand this offering into other markets around Europe and around the world. There's an unmet need in diagnosing and treating people with sleep problems, such as sleep apnea and insomnia, the 2 biggest sleep problems on the planet and especially when there's an overlap of these chronic conditions. This acquisition of mementor broadens our focus in this vertical from a sleep apnea therapy company to a true sleep therapy company. More to come as we pursue growth in this exciting space in Germany and beyond. Growth trends in the global sleep apnea market are in a state of flux in the short term given the market supply-demand dynamics that we talked about and the recall from one of our competitors. Long term, we estimate the underlying growth trends in the global sleep apnea market to be very strong; in the mid-single-digit range for devices and the high single-digit range for masks. As always, our goal is to drive market demand and to meet or beat market growth through generation of new patients and sales of our market-leading therapy solutions and the introduction of new innovations and alternative treatment pathways that enable us to address even more patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Current industry dynamics indicate that we have a multiyear opportunity to drive even greater ongoing acceptance and adoption of our solutions to further solidify our market leadership position. I've challenged our global ResMed team to strive for even stronger growth in the coming months and quarters and the fiscal year and beyond. I'm telling them to go get the share, to go lock in that share with digital health with value that speaks for itself with lower costs, better outcomes for patients and increased efficiencies for the health care system. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business. I want to focus on our strategy to better serve the 380 million people worldwide with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, with many others with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation as well as life support ventilation; as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as our cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller team; and high-flow therapy offerings that we are conducting clinical trials on right now, including our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and neuromuscular disease and beyond remains solid throughout the quarter. Ventilation solution demand was supported by the continued success, adoption and scaling of our AirView for ventilation software platform by customers as they experience the benefits of remote monitoring to better manage their ventilated patient populations through remote access to clinical data as well as customizable physician notifications. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for outside hospital care. Our SaaS business achieved another quarter of high single-digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of verticals, including home medical equipment as well as facilities-based and home-based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software, services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for HME solutions as well as home health solutions. We continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and our data solutions to improve and optimize their business efficiencies and their patient care, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply offerings. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers more and more in person as well as attend trade shows, host conferences, where the interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare, HEALTHCAREfirst and Citus offerings remain very strong. Earlier this week, I personally attended the Inspire 2022 Conference in Austin, Texas. This is MatrixCare's annual customer summit, and it was in person for the first time since 2019. I had the pleasure and the opportunity of presenting and engaging in person with over 600 customers and partners from home health, skilled nursing, senior living, private-duty home care, life plan community verticals and beyond. The passion for caring for each patient that was involved in every conversation I had this week, the openness, the sharing and the ability for us as a community to move patients to lower-cost, lower-acuity and higher-quality outcome cares, those settings was palpable at Inspire 2022. I came away from that conference even more energized and excited about the opportunities that we have to support customers across the care settings with our digital health and our software solutions. The ultimate goal is that customers of our Brightree- and MatrixCare-branded solutions can provide better care for the people that they serve. Given the passion of our customers and the service levels that we're providing and the product pipeline that was discussed at this conference, I expect we'll continue to not only take share from our competitors across the portfolio, but even drive growth with more tech solutions being adopted by customers across care settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for facility-based verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing and to a lesser extent hospice, where patient census rates below -- remain below pre-pandemic levels. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions and better cleaning, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments in these facility-based areas. This provides opportunities for us to sell more services and more tech solutions to existing customers as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. One MatrixCare customer at Inspire 2022 grabbed me at the conference, and he described what he called a rocket ship acceleration of demand at skilled nursing tech solutions for those skilled nursing customers. This is a really welcome sign for sustainable growth across our SaaS portfolio. So as we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to maintain high single-digit growth throughout fiscal year 2023. As always, our goal is to meet or beat market growth rates, and we will continue to invest and innovate to grow the market and to take share. Our growth in SaaS will come through organic and inorganic growth. We've long talked about our desire to expand our SaaS offerings internationally if and when we found the right opportunity for ResMed. In early June, we announced the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for home health and for nursing home providers in Germany. We've been closely watching the evolution of the German digital health system and the associated outside hospital health care system for many years. And we've actually been closely watching MEDIFOX DAN for a number of years. This is our first investment in a pure-play SaaS business in Europe, and it's a great opportunity to expand our reach in this business globally. We're starting in Germany as it is not only a market where we're vertically integrated in our core business of sleep and respiratory care, it's also one of our largest markets globally and a country where the government is investing in digital health reimbursement. We're excited about the opportunity to accelerate innovation and recurring revenue business models through this acquisition in Germany. As we discussed on the acquisition call that we had in June, MEDIFOX DAN will be immediately accretive to ResMed at close. Progress towards closing this acquisition is moving ahead as expected. We remain on track to close by the end of December 2022 in our fiscal 2023 second quarter. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are well positioned, and we have created a differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed with our SaaS business investments. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. And Bobby Ghoshal and the excitement that he had on Inspire 2022 with the crowd for both MatrixCare and Brightree was an inspiration for me as the CEO of the parent company but also for the whole team there. It's an important part of ResMed's future growth, and I see a lot of opportunities to invest in lower-cost, lower-acuity settings of care. We believe that this is the future of health care delivery, and that's where ResMed competes and it's where ResMed wins. To bring it all together, our strategic focus remains on personal care that is patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric. This triple-pronged approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are very well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease, asthma, insomnia and beyond.  We are transforming outside hospital care at scale. We're leading the market in digital health technology with over 12 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 18 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. We have invested in the cybersecurity, the privacy, the cloud ops, the data analytics, the AI/ML capabilities to do this at scale, unmatched by any competitor. And we are increasing our investments and our lead each and every day. Our 2 key global customer-facing software products, AirView and myAir, are 100% in the cloud. Our devices are both cloud-connected and cloud-enabled, making ResMed itself a market-leading cloud-connected and cloud-enabled digital health company. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal this last fiscal year 2022. We changed nearly 141 million lives these last 12 months with our devices, our mask systems, our software solutions, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live higher-quality lives with outside hospital care. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to more than 8,000 ResMedians helping their customers in 140 countries. Your perseverance, hard work and dedication has been impeccable. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q4 despite the headwinds we faced due to significant ongoing supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the June quarter was $915 million, an increase of 4%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and increased device demand generated by our competitor's ongoing product recall. We did not derive incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand during the June quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related demand in the prior year, revenue increased by 10% on a constant currency basis. In relation to the impact of our competitor's recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter. Note, this is consistent with the estimated $60 million to $70 million incremental device revenue in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year '22, this brings the total estimated incremental revenue in the range of $230 million to $250 million associated with our competitor's recall. While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient production components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a stable to improving supply chain environment. This has given us more confidence around our expectation of increasing device production in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year '22. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries increased by 12%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 1% in constant currency terms. By product segment globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6%, while masks and other sales increased by 11%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 11% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to our competitor's recall. Masks and other sales increased by 13%, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales decreased by 2% in constant currency terms or excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 7% in the current -- in constant currency terms. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 7% in constant currency terms or excluding COVID-19-related sales in the prior year increased by 9% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue increased by 8% in the June quarter. We saw a strong performance from our HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing stability in the skilled nursing care segment despite the continuing challenges of COVID-19. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 57.8% in the June quarter. The increase is predominantly attributable to improvement in average selling prices and a positive product mix, partially offset by higher freight component and manufacturing costs, negative geographic mix and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable growth rate we experienced in Q4 last year. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter increased by 6%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 11%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee-related costs and T&E expenses. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue at 21.1% remained broadly consistent with the 20.7% we recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '23. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 7%, or in constant currency terms increased by 11%. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% in fiscal year '23. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 4%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 17.6% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year '23 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the quarter increased by 10%, and our diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 10%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $79 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $29 million; depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $37 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter in fiscal year '23 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $274 million. At June 30, we had $780 million in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At June 30, we had approximately $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We recently announced the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition and expect to close this transaction before the end of the calendar year pending regulatory clearances. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&D and also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently announced acquisition of mementor, a German pioneer and health tech start-up that develops and distributes digital medical products in the field of sleep medicine and related areas. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'll now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and manage the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada.
Craig Wong-Pan: Mick, you mentioned at the start that you were seeing some improvement in the global supply chain. I just wanted to understand the details around what you meant by that improvement, and when that could start to see improvements to your manufacturing volumes.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. And what we've seen over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters was a really deteriorating supply situation, where we were getting decommits, a word I'd never heard of in supply chain, including my time at BHP and other companies that just -- you never heard of that sort of supply even in commodity industries, and to get it in specialty industries was so unusual. What we're seeing is that sort of noise is starting to go away. And what I'd say is it's a stable to improving component supply environment and that's what we're seeing. But I don't know, Rob, if you want to provide any further color on the supply chain and how we're -- for the details on how we're seeing a supply that's stable to improving on components.
Robert Douglas: Sure. Yes, Mick. Craig, one of the sort of fundamental things of supply chain management is ongoing risk management and having sort of the ability to foresee problems and to react through all of that. And then you also manage your risk through inventories and that type of thing. We've over recent months put in place a lot of forward orders, working a lot on relationships with key suppliers. We suspect that sort of global demand on these suppliers is moderating a little bit. And then as Mick says, that means that they're sticking with their commitments at a higher level than what we have seen recently. There are always problems to overcome. And as Mick said earlier, there are other bottlenecks. Once we close one bottleneck, we have to go and work on the next. But overall, I'd say we're feeling better about the forward outlook that we have, and we've got a little more clarity. It's not perfect. There still will be challenges and undoubtedly unexpected things that we'll have to manage through, but the net of it all is that we should see our volumes continue to increase from here.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs.
Chris Cooper: So I noticed, Mick and Brett, no specific guidance on the recall tailwind in fiscal '23. Obviously, I understand the prudence. But I guess just given the importance of the debate, perhaps you can just share your latest thoughts on how you see that dynamic playing out this year.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris, and it's a really good one. But as you know, we've annualized the impact of that competitor recall. And for us now, as I said in my prepared remarks, for the next 12 months, I do not believe there'll be really in the new patient market given the consent decree work they've got to do, the remediation work they've got to do in responding to that and the observations. And so what that means for us is basically demand that is incredible for these next 12 months, and that every device we make will be solved as it comes through the manufacturing line. And so the rate-limiting step on that, as Rob said, will be a bunch of bottlenecks that we'll work our way through. And it's like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We just keep -- find a problem, solve it; find the next problem, solve it. And ResMed is exceptional at that continuous improvement process. Our supply chain teams, our manufacturing teams, our distribution teams have been heroic in the ventilator crisis in 2020 and then the supply chain crisis of '21-'22. And so that gives us confidence to say sequentially every quarter through fiscal '23, we're going to see those volumes improve. And we've got line of sight to that, and we've got interactions with suppliers on that, and we think it's going to go up every quarter. I don't look at this as incremental or temporal taking of share now. This is permanent share taking. We're going to go in, we're going to get the share, we're going to lock it in with digital health solutions. And when somebody uses something that lowers their labor costs by 50%, that improves the adherence rate of the end customer, the patient, to 87%, 9 out of 10 patients getting adherent at day 9 and beyond, that's where we can lock it in. So that's sort of some extra color for you, Chris, but great question.
Operator: Next question is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley.
Sean Laaman: Mick, my question is around the card to cloud devices. And is there anything that you note with respect to either compliance rates or resupply potential with card to cloud versus direct cloud connectivity? And is there a view that maybe you get patients that are on card to cloud devices back to the fully charged AirSense 11 at some point?
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Sean. Two questions. Card to cloud AirSense 10 is really new. I mean we just really launched it midway through and really in the month of June in the quarter. So it's early days on that. But we've got a lot of experience with card to cloud. I mean think about the S8 and then the S9 with its little SD chip in the back of S9. The product -- when I was running the sleep business, we launched that back in '09 and '10. And we -- so we have a lot of experience with card to cloud. And it's primarily -- the card to cloud, primarily volume has been in the U.S. And that's where we had a very strong digital health system and engagement with our HME partners in a card to cloud environment. So we don't have sort of adherence exact numbers delta between AS 10 C2C versus AS 11.  I think it will be higher, the adherence on the AirSense 11 just because we're getting double the rate of myAir uptake, and that digital health engagement drives higher adherence. And I can tell you as soon as we get clearance on line of sight to those comms chips picking up supply, we'll move everybody to AirSense 11 as soon as we have it.  Probably, we won't go back and retrofit the groups that are there, just because people when they get therapy, they're happy. And the data will go to the cloud, they just won't go to the cloud every day. It will go when the SD card is uploaded on day 30, 60 or 90, and when they see the home care provider and the physician. And so they're not lost patients, they're not lost data. They're still part of the ecosystem, it's just not quite as efficient as it could be. So we're going to get back to AS 11 and really ramping that as fast as possible. But given the supply demand crisis, I was amazed and thrilled that our team was able to pivot in June, get there. And we're going to be able to do that through September and December quarters here as well and beyond. But thanks for your question, Sean.
Operator: Next question is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.
Margarate Boeye: This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret today. I wanted to ask one on ReSupply, just the trends you're seeing this quarter and if you're continuing to see incremental and permanent share gains within that market as well.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Maggie. Great question, allows us to talk about masks. Despite that competitor not being there for new patient setups where we had a lot of adoption of ResMed masks on their platform as well as ours and then it's not in the market. We saw mask growth rates at 11% constant currency globally. We saw 13% constant currency growth in the quarter on masks in the U.S. And we saw a pretty strong 7% constant currency growth on masks in Europe, Middle East and other markets. And so I actually think that the team and all the work we've done with Brightree and Snap ReSupply in the U.S. and all the work our European and Middle East teams and our Asia teams have done around engaging patients digitally through either myAir or other marketing and adherence programs have performed really well. And despite the headwind of lower new patient setups, we're achieving at or above market growth rates. And to the second part of your question, yes, I do think we're taking share across categories. And I think we're creating new categories by some of our innovations in the different types of comfort and design of the masks, the minimalist masks, the fun comfort masks, the over-the-head masks and -- so creating new segments, taking share in those and being able to lock in that share. Because when a patient gets happy on their mask, like I am with my AirFit P10, they tend to stick with it for life. And it's a great thing for us to be able to do on that. So really excited about it, and I look forward to more mask innovation coming out and more share taking and locking it in over time.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: I guess I wanted to ask a question on the gross margins. Do you have a sense of kind of what the supply issues, FX, retrofitting, all of this is having on your productivity and kind of gross margins in FY '22?
Michael Farrell: That's a great question, Matthew. I'm going to hand that to Brett. Any color on GM there for Matthew?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Matthew, I mean it is because we're just trying to maximize the devices out the door with the components that we have. So as you think through that, in terms of manufacturing optimization, that's -- we've really struggled with that. So I do think as we get further through this and some of the supply issues abate, then I think we do have some opportunities there on for manufacturing, think around manufacturing recoveries to significantly improve from where we are. So I do think that's an opportunity for us. It's not immediate, but if you look through the medium term, there is definitely opportunity for us to optimize there.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden.
Steven Wheen: You can hear me here, yes?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Got you loud and clear, Steve.
Steven Wheen: Yes. Great. Also, just on the gross margin for Brett. We're seeing in freight costs spot prices for shipping and for airfreight coming down by about 30% at the moment from its peak in March. I just wonder when we might start to see that appearing in the gross margin and if there's any changes with regards to semiconductor chip pricing that is worth calling out in more recently.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Steve, it's Brett. The -- Yes, I mean you're sort of seeing some of that or you're seeing some of these freight costs definitely moderate -- some cost reductions, but certainly not manifesting our numbers at the moment. I think we'll get some of that benefit, I would say, in our second half, where we'll probably see some of that coming through. But at this stage, I'd say, look, it's not even in our margin at the moment. But we do have some potential on freight in the second half, both on rates, and I think also we'll skew a little more -- start putting a little more on sea freight as we get through the back of the year as well, and that will certainly help us on our overall freight costs. So again, just kind of that environment where you're seeing some moderation or stabilization. And then I'm seeing as we get through fiscal year '23, some opportunities could be at manufacturing, be on the freight side as well. But we're not seeing that just yet in our numbers.
Operator: Your next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan.
David Low: Maybe just continuing on the cost around gross margins. Can I get, perhaps you, Brett, to talk about the impact of inflation, what you're seeing on costs, and what you expect or what we should be looking out for in terms of margins and the impact there for?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean we've seen component inflation, component cost increases. We've certainly seen that in electronic components. We've talked -- we've clearly talked about the freight and the increases that we have seen there. So that's all been built in, if you like, to our cost base at the moment. Going forward, I think we'll still see some of those increases, but I think that's manageable. And then what we've done, as you know, is we've done a little bit on our pricing to customers as well to help offset some of that. So we put through the device surcharge, for example. And we're also planning some modest price increases from July 1 as well. So some of this is going to offset some of that. And -- but I would say, yes, we saw that -- is it accelerating? No, but we're still seeing some cost and component increases coming through. Probably -- I would expect to see that probably for the next little while. But it's not -- we're not seeing any acceleration in that, which I think is good. So I think that there's some offsets there on the gross margin, headwinds on components. I guess some tailwind on ASPs will be benefit for margin going forward.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse.
Gretel Janu: So just moving back to revenue. How much revenue did the card to cloud contribute in the fourth quarter? And then I guess going forward, do you expect it to be meaningful in FY '23?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel, and it's a really good one. For competitive reasons, I don't want to go into too much detail around it, other than to say that, that pivot of the team during the quarter was incredible. To redesign, reengineer and requalify, validate and verify a device with a new model of card to cloud and get it to market and get it in customers' hands in June was fantastic. So all credit to the team. It was material to our growth in the quarter, and it will be material to our growth up to and when we get those comms chip supply back to the levels that we need it to meet the incredible demand of the marketplace.  So it was material. It was strong, not going to quantify it down to the nth level of detail here. But it provided great additional growth for us in that last quarter and will for the coming quarters. I look forward to the point where I can say we are no longer selling AirSense 10 card to cloud because that means that we've got AirSense 11 connectivity and AirSense 10 connectivity back up to where we need it with that component no longer being a bottleneck for us. But that may be 3, 6, 9, 12 months out there with this incredible demand we're seeing in the market.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital.
Saul Hadassin: Mick, just following up on that card to cloud commentary. Can you just confirm or give us some color as to what happens to those machines once the chip alleviation is completed and you start to get better access to comms chips? Is the intention to bring those devices back and put those chips in? Or if you buy -- if you get issued a card to cloud device, do you effectively keep that device for the next sort of 5 years and then upgrade at some point in the future?
Michael Farrell: Yes. So it's a really good question. I think it will probably be the latter part of your question -- or the answer to your question that you gave, which is it will probably be -- when somebody receives a device, it becomes a very personal, very intimate part. It sits on their bedside table. It gives them the gift of breath, the gift of sleep, and it changes their life. And the fact that they may have to take an SD card to the doctor, to their HME provider or have it mailed back and forth won't stop them from having that personal and intimate relationship. So there will be some very savvy patients who will see that and want to upgrade in less than that 3-year -- depending on insurance, 3- to 5-year time horizon. But I think the vast majority of those will remain there permanently. And our job will be to provide the great services around AirView and the engagement that we provide through some of our VoIP. And we do e-mail, text and interactions with patients that go well above just the cloud connectivity from the device itself that we've had in place on our Air Solutions ecosystem for a long time. So I'm very confident we're going to get very high adherence from the AirSense 10 card to cloud people with the ecosystem we have. It will be better with Air 11. So as soon as those components are back there, we'll do that. But I think there'll be a small group of people that will look to upgrade their device before insurance provides it in certain socioeconomic groups in certain countries. Just to be clear, we're really focusing card to cloud right now in the U.S., and that's where we've got a really good ecosystem of home care providers who know how to use card readers and get the data to the cloud and get it into AirView and get it to doctors and engage their patients to drive ReSupply through other means, Brightree, Snap and whole Air Solutions ecosystem. Great questions, Saul. But I think it will be mostly the latter, answer to your own question there.
Operator: Next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee.
Dan Hurren: Mick, you've been quite specific in the past about these streams of engineering efforts to overcome supply chain shortages, and I guess, including the AirSense 11 range with parts alternate suppliers. So the card to cloud device clearly had a big impact. But do you have any update on the timing of these other initiatives? And will that be a calendar year '22 feature?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Dan, it's a really good question. And we have our Chief Operating Officer on the line here who's closer to the other 4 work streams. The fifth one is that reengineering for C2C and beyond. Rob, any color for Dan on all that work we're doing in the supply chain and the reengineering we're doing to -- the streams of engineering work we're doing to increase supply over the fiscal year?
Robert Douglas: Yes, Dan. I mean one of the key areas, obviously, is in the columns is around getting access to some of the 5G protocols that are being rolled out. And we're seeing them get rolled out pretty nicely in some markets. And some of our validation, some of those streams are getting access to those types of chips, including we're getting access to earlier-gen protocols as well. And we'll be deploying both of those. I don't think we can give you granularity over it. And it's not without risk in some of the timing. But what we will be doing is as soon as we can deploy and validate and have access to those chip volumes, we'll switch to that as quickly as possible. So it won't actually be a single overnight switch of now, all of a sudden, everything has gone to some new protocol or something; they'll be targeted to markets in specific volumes, and we'll keep doing work on that. As I said earlier, the outlook in terms of the overall demand for these chips from other parts of industries, obviously, cars and phones, may be looking a little better for us. And certainly, people are less likely to allocate away from us. So we're expecting to be able to plan a little more certainty, but we won't be able to sort of publicly give out the exact dates and things like that on those deployments.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie.
David Bailey: My question is just around consumables and masks and accessories. Are we expecting increased device output over fiscal '23? Just interested in your thoughts on the impact of that on masks and accessories volumes and what that might mean to masks and accessories revenues. And then also, do you think the attachment rates on market share, that those incremental revenues would be higher than you may have seen in the past?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. It's a really good question. And I mean, as you saw in the quarter, 11% CC global and 13% CC in the U.S. in Q4, right, where we're only just starting to ramp up AirSense 10 card to cloud to meet that -- some of that incremental demand gap.  Yes, as we talked about every quarter during fiscal '23, we plan to see incremental growth in our volume delivery across the portfolio of AirSense 10 comms, AirSense 11 card to cloud and AirSense 11 comms. And as Rob just described, all those streams that are going to mean we're going to have increased volume every quarter sequentially throughout fiscal '23. And to your question specifically, that does mean that masks and consumables attached to those new patients will add on.  As you know, a very large double-digit percentage of any quarter's revenue on masks and accessories is ReSupply and recurring revenue of the installed base of patients. And so that installed base has been incredibly strong. The engagement of people post COVID in respiratory health, respiratory hygiene and making sure that a clean mask, clean humidifier, clean tubing, it's just been full front with everyone wearing masks for COVID and understanding communicable respiratory diseases like COVID makes them think about respiratory health and hygiene. So that's a permanent change we've seen over the last 12, 24 months in sort of secular demand on the installed base. And then you add to that, that sort of lower double-digit number of the new patients coming in, which is picking up as supply goes.  So I know you guys have all got models on this, David. You've got a good model. You'll start to see that mask and consumable rate pick up. It won't be like a step change jumping up, but there will be a sort of second derivative change, if you like, a little bit of increase in the rate of increase for a while on masks and accessories throughout fiscal year as we get the supply of devices closer and closer to the demand that is out there for these next 12 months, way ahead of where we can get to. But it means every device we make, we sell.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham Company.
Michael Matson: I was curious if the card to cloud units are helping your gross margin at all by taking out those -- the other chipsets. I mean is that resulting in some savings that's having material impact on your margins? Or is it not really the case?
Michael Farrell: Brett, you want to answer Mike's question?
Brett Sandercock: Sure, Mick. Yes, Mike. Yes, so the card to cloud, I mean, obviously, doesn't have the comms module in it, so there is some savings there. So it is positive for our margin, but it would really might just be around the edges. It wouldn't -- like it wouldn't be material.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer.
Suraj Kalia: Mick, I'll throw in a two part question, if I could, Mick. For the card to cloud, how much of this shift is tactical and how much of it is strategic? Because the market growth -- you've always referenced 5% to 8% growth for the market. Maybe if you can just parse out how the shift long term would help ResMed's overall device growth.  And if I could quickly, Brett, if I take SG&A in FY '22, right, 8% to 9% year-over-year, and that approximate to about 20% to 22% of revs, my math is around $3.6 billion to $4 billion for FY '23. Is that the right way to think about it? Sorry, gentlemen, for squeezing in the second question.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Very cheeky, Suraj, but we'll go at it. I'll go briefly at the first one, then hand to Brett for the second part of your 2-part one question. So the card to cloud, look, it is tactical. It's based on the fact that -- for a very important thing. We have people suffocating out there. They get all the way through the health care system, screen, diagnosed and then get a prescription, and they're waiting for a device. And we said we're not going to have our strategy, which is 100% connectivity in every device through comms chips, get in the way of the patient needs. So it's a tactical pivot based upon the comms chips being in a rate-limiting bottleneck of our supply that we're going to do the AirSense 10 C2C. As soon as that supply moves, we go straight back to 100% connectivity AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 devices. So it's tactical, temporal, and we're going to go back to it.  We're going to do the best we can for those patients, and they're going to get incredible adherence, just won't have all the tech of the daily feedback that you get on those devices with Air 11 and the double myAir uptake that you get with AirSense 11. And that's why I want everyone to get an AirSense 11 as soon as we get the components. And our supply chain team knows that, our customers know that, and we're ready to ramp up over the fiscal year. So a tactical shift. Brett, I'll just quickly say on that -- the second part of the question, I think our competitor put out some numbers that they think the market is today and in 2025. And I think they underestimated the actual market today and the market in 2025 by 25%, 30%, even 35%. I think they were talking about $2.1 billion device market in 2025. For me, it's north of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion, even more than that in 2025, if we get our demand gen and drive it. And we're going to get the lion's share of that. But Brett, any thoughts?
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Yes. Suraj, I mean given some broad guidance, I guess, on the SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I wouldn't get drawn into kind of strict revenue guidance. I'd just reiterate what we said before. We're expecting an increase in production volumes, and that should definitely support sequential revenue growth through FY '23.
Operator: Our final question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America.
Lyanne Harrison: I was hoping if you could help us understand the softer device sales in rest of the world a little bit better. Obviously, understanding that you're having that cloud -- card to cloud push in the United States. But can you give us a sense of what the market's like in rest of the world, and what you're seeing from competitors other than Philips in that market?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question, and it's pretty simple, the answer, in that in Q4 of our fiscal '21, we had $20 million of COVID-related ventilator sales in India. And if we can all remember 12 months ago, there was a huge surge of the COVID variant in India, and we sold $20 million of ventilators to Delhi, Bangalore and across the country to save lives. And it was incredible, the way we pivoted and got those $20 million worth of sales out. Justin Leon and his team did a great job of getting to India. So if you subtract that $20 million of COVID sales out there, you actually see a positive growth -- a good positive growth in devices in Europe, Asia and rest of world. And what you're seeing, to the broader part of your question, is actually in countries where they don't have these, I would say, now illogical COVID lockdowns that are happening in a couple of geographies, China and a couple of other countries are sticking with these lockdowns, we're seeing well over 100% rates of patient flow.  And so incredible demand for our products, both on the ventilation side and on the device side, back to where we were, which is mid-single-digit device growth in the device side and high single-digit growth on the masks and accessories. And we're getting even higher than that, as you saw in the numbers, because we're driving share, we're driving demand and we're getting patients out there. So that's what it all is. But yes -- no, that Europe, Asia, Rest of the world was really just associated with those ventilator sales.
Operator: We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders. And thank you for your hard work, your dedication, helping over 141 million people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the country in over 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here on our earnings call in about 90 days, plus or minus. And with that, I'll hand over to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everybody. We do appreciate your time and your interest. And if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly to Investor Relations. This does conclude our fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 conference call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.
Operator: Certainly. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-04-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2022 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you Kevin. Hi everyone and welcome to ResMed’s third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live, and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of our earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed’s Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, President-Sleep and Respiratory Care; and David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the supporting schedules in today's earnings release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future operating and financial performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that are made today. I'd like to now turn the conference call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 ended March 31. Our third quarter results reflect strong performance across our business with double-digit revenue growth in our sleep and respiratory care business, and high single digit growth in our software as a service segment. Our growth is the direct result of our global team's ability to pivot and drive for results, even as we continue to manage through several external challenges that are impacting our business, including one, on-going supply chain disruptions; two, COVID restrictions in parts of the world, three, recovering post-COVID Peak patient flow, and four unprecedented demand from a competitor recall, which will keep them out of the market at least through the end of the calendar year. The global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries. I'm very proud of our team growing double-digits this quarter year-on-year with an astounding 30% growth this quarter for devices in U.S. Canada, and Latin America. Even with this incredible growth, the demand in the market was even greater. As with almost all customers in the global components industry, we remain on allocation from our suppliers, particularly for electronic components, with our number one bottleneck being semiconductor chips. This allocation impacts our ability to meet the incredible demand that we see in our marketplace. And we are forced intern to allocate ResMed products to our customers. We have established guiding principles for allocation, giving priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Additionally, the on-going challenges of sea freights and air freight due to reduced availability and increased prices are impacting our ability to efficiently get components into and finished goods out of our factories worldwide. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners doing everything that we can to secure additional supply to further increase production of our devices. This work includes a combination of a number of workstreams. One, shoring up the flow of existing parts from existing suppliers, two establishing flow of existing parts from new suppliers, three validating new parts from existing suppliers, and four validating and verifying new parts from new suppliers as we review and redesign across key devices in our portfolio. In addition, we have fifth line of work. So it's five lines of work and that fifth line is reengineering designs to eliminate and or mitigate the top bottlenecks to achieve greater flow through our supply chain. The most significant example of a project in this fifth line of work is our newly released AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud device. This device eliminates the number one bottleneck of the 3G, 4G comms chip, while facilitating secure data upload to our cloud based software platform called AirView so that providers and physicians can access the data and better manage the patient. We've already begun to offer AirSense 10 Card-to-cloud devices in select markets to some customers, and we will be ramping up from there. With these five lines of work continuing in parallel, we have been able to offset some of the impact of continuing component shortages and de-commits to help us better support patients, providers and physicians. We recognize that this is a very difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians who feel the pressure from their patients, home medical equipment providers who see this every day in their businesses, but also payers and entire healthcare systems and especially the most important customer, the patient themselves. We are partnering across the industry to be the solutions provider to these problems. We expect a significant backlog of patients diagnosed and coming through the system to be present for at least the next 12 to 18 months with incredible associated demand. We are working to address this demand with these portfolios of supply projects and beyond, and we will get through this time stronger than ever as an industry and as a company. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other key chronic respiratory insufficiency diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out of the hospital care software as a service solutions. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly discuss the other broad market conditions in our industry. We continue to see steady on-going recovery of patient flow and demand through the diagnostic channel across the countries that we operate in. In fact, many countries are above 100% of pre-COVID levels of patient flow. However on-going surges, variance, and government restrictions continue to impact a few countries which will remain below pre-COVID diagnostic levels. China is a case in point right now with severe shutdowns in Shanghai and beyond. But across our portfolio, our global portfolio, we're in 140 countries that we serve, I expect that these metrics will steadily improve to pre-COVID patient levels and beyond. As vaccines and boosters roll out globally, and people remain focused on their personal respiratory health and hygiene that's been a big learning through COVID. With the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established COVID cleaning protocols, sleep labs and other facilities, I expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each and every time. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one, which is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma businesses. Number two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital where people live, and especially in the home. The U.S. launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. Although it is challenging to differentiate on-going positive customer sentiment and feedback from the incredibly high demand in the U.S. market and beyond. The AirSense 11 has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all time high demand for ResMed devices, and it couldn't have launched at a better time for that purpose to help us mitigate on-going component shortages. We will introduce the AirSense 11 into additional countries in the fourth quarter that we're in right now here at fiscal year 2022 and throughout fiscal 2023. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10, which is second in customer preference only to the AirSense 11 including the new Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 as we seek to maximize the total volume of CPAP APAP and bi-levels [ph] available for all of our customers. With our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy in a digitally native environment like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our home medical equipment and homecare provider customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients. AirView for physicians and providers, and Brightree for HME providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs, and together with us we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. With the latest technology built into the AirSense 11 platform, we are driving higher adoption rates of the myAir app by patients higher than ever before. Right now, we are seeing more than double the myAir adoption rate as patients engage directly in their own health care. People want personal care. They want their own data on their own app on their own phone. And they liked the coaching and the personal engagement of our digital ecosystem. This means more patients are signing up onto myAir every day and fully engaging with ResMed’s software technology, helping us to now pass over 11.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. Ultimately these software solutions, these big data deliver a better patient experience. They deliver better efficiencies for homecare providers, and most importantly, they deliver greater long term adherence to therapy by patients. Let me spend just a couple of minutes outlining some real world evidence showing that greater therapy adherence leads to lower hospitalizations, lower mortality, and better clinical outcomes through mitigation of chronic disease. We are demonstrating better patient outcomes and lowering costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry. These are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. The latest example is a study recently published in the landmark American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Journal, also known in the industry as the Blue Journal. This article demonstrates that patients with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were adherent to CPAP therapy versus non-adherence to CPAP therapy, and it showed significant year one and year two reduction of clinical use by over 30% and reduction of inpatient hospitalizations by nearly 50%. It showed a 20% reduction in year one and year two total healthcare resource cost, which included a 25% reduction in emergency room costs and a 52% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations. These are important metrics for the whole healthcare system. Another key aspect of our long term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnostic funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and respiratory health, including telehealth tools, and specifically home-based sleep apnea tests. Although driving demand generation is not a priority in the immediate term, given the supply shortage and incredible demand we're facing, we are maintaining our long term focus and investments in this diagnostic channel so that we are ready when conditions improve to ensure sustainable, long term pipelines of new patients coming through the channel. With 1.6 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. It's also our duty to do this. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create even more efficient and effective approaches to sleep apnea, patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment, and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enable what we call an end-to-end seamless digital experience for patients. One example we recently rolled out is the next generation of our remote mask selector tool that makes mask selection and sizing easier and more effective by creating personalized mask recommendations based on a patient's health, sleep attributes and their own facial measurements. Choosing the right mask is challenging to do remotely. But getting the right mask fit is crucial to patient comfort and long term adherence. The technology MaskSelector is a web based tool that solves this problem by prompting the patient to answer a few simple questions and follow a few easy steps with their camera enabled smartphone to capture a digital facial scan. Based on the answers and the digital facial measurements, MaskSelector then provides a recommended mask and sizing. Whether a patient is then being set up at home remotely, or preparing for a face-to-face interaction with a respiratory therapist and clinical staff at a provider's office MaskSelector helps the patient quickly get to the right mask for their unique needs. Turning to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with COPD worldwide, and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach many hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as our cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology, and the high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency patients remain strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the U.S. where providers shifted focus to supporting the most severe and highest acuity patients. This demand and the work of providers is aligned with the ResMed guiding principles of our allocation process, specifically to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation. As I speak, we are not component constrained on our life support ventilator called Astral. Let me now review our software as a service business for out of hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets, including home medical equipment, as well as facilities based and home based care settings. Our SaaS customers recognize the need for technology solutions to solve their challenges with efficiency and scale, and our software services and solutions help them achieve both. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products. And we continue to grow with our customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including our landmark Brightree and SNAP ReSupply products. As businesses continue to open up, we've been able to visit customers in person, as well as to attend SaaS trade shows where interest in our Brightree, MatrixCare and Citus offerings to name a few remain very strong. We have a very solid pipeline in SaaS. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, where headwinds have kept patients census rates below pre-pandemic levels. But as COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent up demand for technology investments, which provide opportunities for us to sell more services and more solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue growth to maintain high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year, and well into the next fiscal year and beyond. As always, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate, and we expect to grow the market and take market share. We are the leading, strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care. And we provide mission critical software across a broad range of very attractive vertical markets. We are well positioned and we have created differentiated value for customers and for ResMed with our SaaS businesses. I'm excited about the future of our SaaS business. It's an important part of ResMeds future growth and I see a lot of opportunities to innovate in lower cost, lower acuity settings of care. It's the future of healthcare delivery with strong organic and inorganic growth in ahead for ResMed. Our focus is on personal care that is patient centric, physician centric and provider centric. This approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and beyond. We are transforming out of hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology. As I said earlier, we have over 11.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud. And we have over 17 million cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de identified data to help patients directly, but also to help providers, physicians, payers, and entire healthcare systems. We have invested in the cyber security, the privacy, cloud operations, as well as data analytics, including artificial intelligence machine learning capabilities to do this at a scale unmatched by our competitors. And we are increasing our lead each and every day. Our two key software, customer facing products, AirView and myAir are now 100% managed in the cloud. So not only are our devices cloud connected and our software cloud enabled, we here at ResMed as a company, are cloud connected and cloud enabled. Infact, we are a leading digital health company globally. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates me and ResMedians around the world every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal during the last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks. I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8000 ResMedians worldwide for their perseverance their hard work and their dedication during these on-going and unprecedented times. Thank you for all that you do. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett and Sydney [ph] and then we will move to open the lines for Q&A. Over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. I'll provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We had solid financial performance in Q3 despite the headwinds we faced as a result and significant on-going supply chain constraints and a challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the March quarter was $865 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care products across our portfolio driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the on-going product recall by one of our competitors. In the March quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19 related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $35 million to $45 million in the March quarter. For the first three quarters of FY 22, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $170 million to $190 million. We continue to experience challenges in securing sufficient components and this has hampered our ability to materially increase our supply of devices. We expect our fiscal fourth quarter to remain supply constraints and similar to our recent fiscal quarters, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the fourth quarter. We now expect a total incremental device revenue opportunity for fiscal year 2022 will fall somewhere between $200 million and $250 million. Looking at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Of that segment, globally in constant current terms, device sales increased by 21%, while masks and other sales increased by 9%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America increased by 30%, as we've benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the high acuity patients first. Masks and other sales in the U.S. Canada and Latin America increased by 7%, reflecting solid resupply revenue achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient’s setups. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 13% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the March quarter. We saw strong performance out of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 150 basis points to 58.1% in the March quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a positive product mix, due to strong growth in our higher acuity devices and improvement in average selling prices following the introduction of the device surcharge. Moving on to operating expenses. We are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside compared to the low comparable and negative price rates we experienced in Q3 last year. SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 17%. The increase was probably attributed to an increase in employee related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue at 21% remained broadly consistent with the 20.9% we reported in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of FY 22. R&D expenses for the quarter increased by 19% or in constant currency terms increased by 22%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to 7.3% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin and higher operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 21.1%, compared to the prior year quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rates for the full fiscal year 22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 2% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter also increased by 2%. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $117 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $48 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter we pay dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $2.6 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the premise on a joint venture with Verily, We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter, the balance of fiscal year 22 and into FY 23 associated with a joint venture operation. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $202 million. At March 31, we had $681 million in gross debt, and $479 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at March 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Kevin, I'd like to ask you to come back on the line. I'll turn the call over to you to provide instructions and to manage the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks very much. If I could just start with a question on the guidance from the benefit from the field free call. So it's fallen $100 million short of where you are projecting a year or so ago. Just wondering how you are now thinking about that opportunity set as we move into the new financial year?
Mick Farrell: Hey, David, yes, it's Mick here. That's a good question. And, clearly as we in the second half of the year now we're readjusting that expectation for FY 22 now in total to be 200 to 250. You look I'll just be very open, very specifically a contract from 12 months ago with a particular I will not name them. But a particular semiconductor supplier had a very significant double-digit de-commit in these last months, weeks, and there's a commitment from 12 months ago, that had some very strong supply and it went down double-digits. And so with that as a headwind into us all the tail winds of our work, the five projects, five lines of projects going on in our supply chain allowed us to sort of, take two steps forward and two steps back versus two steps forward and one step back. And that didn't allow us to achieve that that extra 100 million of incremental revenue that we thought that we would achieve here through fiscal 22 for the first half. And so that's going to be tougher and as things a little bit further back. Having said that some of these projects coming to market such as the Card-to-cloud AirSense 10 device, where we eliminate that bottleneck or the number one bottleneck, which is the 3G, 4G comms chip. And we allow, the next bottleneck, which is another electronic components to become the one, we can then speed up some production to make up some of that difference. And that's allowed us to achieve the 30% year-on-year growth that we saw in devices in U.S., Canada, and Latin America and the 10% year-on-year growth that we achieved this quarter for Europe, Asia and rest of the world. Look, it's not perfect sailing ahead. When you get de-commits. I'd never heard that word de-commit. We're offering you got a signed contract, you're offering money, very good margins, long term contracts, and people just can't supply. Often force majeure and other aspects coming into play. But I can tell you that all the work that we've been doing these hard works by supply chain have allowed us to actually to achieve these results despite that headwind. We're not planning on giving guidance for FY 23 around this. We are saying that this is what I'll say. What we're doing is going to strive for sequential growth every quarter as we go ahead. So sequential growth from March to June, June to September, September to December throughout this fiscal year. That's what we're going for. And I actually think as you start to look towards the second half of the calendar year, you look at the December quarter, there are a number of other projects that don't involve necessarily the risk of an externality of other de-commit from someone else's enough projects. And enough, I would say, new suppliers, new components, new designs and new engineering reengineering that we're doing around both the hardware and the software to give us a strong confidence in supply of product ahead. So I think that supply chain have done amazingly. And, if you look at what we would have achieved, 14% growth, constant currency year-on-year, yes, we could have, we could have got to 20% or 25%, if we'd had unlimited supply, de-commits, and changes in supply chain in global semiconductor and other electronic components have been a headwind. But I think with all the work we've got, we're going to power through this, we got a strong ship, there are waves ahead, but we're going to power through it stronger than ever. And I think our team has done a great job in the supply that we're going to get throughout this calendar year will be a great opportunity for sequential growth as we go through.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Just one question on the backlog of patients. So you did mention in your prepared remarks, just trying to see if you can quantify how large the backlog is currently? And how long are patients waiting to get on to treatment? Is there something that ResMed can do to keep these patients engaged? Or is there a risk that they potentially fall out of the system? If they don't get onto product, in a in a short period of time?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question. And yes, as you know that I talked about at least 12 to 18 months of a backlog, which is, in many industries you say fantastic to have a backlog, but these are patients waiting therapy and to the specific party a question Gretel, how long will any individual patient wait? It's not like a patient gets a diagnosis, and they have to wait 12 to 18 months. It depends on the geography and the environment. It might be eight days or eight weeks, depending on the geography and our flow of products. But an individual patient is not sitting out there told, Oh, you've got this life threatening disease, we'll take care of you next April. They're being told look, it's going to take for four weeks. And they're not happy with that. I mean, they've been told they suffocate maybe 100 times per night, maybe 50 times per hour, if they've got very severe sleep apnea. And they're suffocating. They want therapy, and so that that pressure is there, and the desire is there. We're watching very carefully. I mean, obviously we're involved in the substitute therapies. We sell a dental divides all across western and northern Europe with a number one provider, with novel our technology. We're not seeing this huge movement over to dental and the 100 muscle nerve stem that we're investing through in Astella [Ph]. We're not seeing a huge movement over to those substitutes. So they're being told by the doctor, it's eight days or it's eight weeks, and they're accepting that and they're sitting there in that pipeline. What I mean by the 12 to 18 month backlog is if you look at the net of the industry, this is building up because the number two player here is out. As they said earlier this week, they said at least through the end of this calendar year. I think they said that only be 90% done with their [Indiscernible] by the end of this calendar year. So that means the rest of us have to step up and ResMed is the number one player and we're stepping up the most and we're stepping up incredibly well. And I think we'll do that through it. But even when they come back online, it's not like the backlog goes away the day they come on. That's there and it's for all of us to drive. I think the share that we've gained is going to be entrenched because of the digital solutions we have and we'll go and gain from there. But the patients are there and I think it's awful that somebody might have to wait four weeks, or eight weeks. I don't want them to wait more than 4 hours to 8 hours. But right in the moment we're in this situation will be that way for a period of time given these unprecedented circumstances.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: And good morning all. Thank you for taking my question. Can we just talk a little bit about the device and mass dynamics in both Americas and rest of the world? Obviously, Americans had softer devices, but sorry, had Americans had stronger device growth, but much softer mass growth there. Can you I guess, share what your thoughts are around to the extent that's driven by fewer devices in the market as opposed to resupply, and then vice versa for the rest of the world.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Lyanne for the question. Yes, as you mentioned, very strong device growth in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, 30%. And very solid growth in devices in Europe, Asia, elsewhere at 10% netting out at 21% cc across that sector. In the math side actually, if you go back to 2019, Lyanne when we were talking about market growth, right, we were talking then about devices, mid-single digits and masks being high single digits, I look at our global mask growth rate at 9% constant currency with the headwind of new diagnoses downward or competitive being out for new patient stops. And the U.S. Canada, Latin America at 7% constant currency as pretty reasonable growth, new patients are down but what we're actually doing there is working with resupply with Brightree resupply, with SNAP technology ReSupply in the U.S. and around the world with some of our models are working with patients directly in markets like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and our western and northern European teams working with hospitals and care delivery systems to achieve that 13% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and America. And I think, I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead the President of our global sleep business, but Jim, I think we're actually taking share in some of those categories again in the quarter.
Jim Hollingshead: So thanks, Mick. And thanks, Lyanne it’s a great question. I think this is one of those weird circumstances for us where the numbers don't actually very clearly convey the underlying dynamics. And the reason for that is the volumes and the revenue growth we're producing in different markets is almost completely contingent on which SKUs we can produce, right. So it's a little bit, it's a little bit complicated. But we can, when we can produce devices that have sell chips that can go into certain European markets, and we have those components, then we get more growth for that period of time as we ship those products. And then sometimes those specific SKUs get constrained. And so the dynamic is actually pretty constant across all geographies, which is very, very high demand for our devices. Very, very high demand for our masks. There is a headwind on masks, because new patient starts are down because the market is under supplied. But really across all geographies there are tailwinds for masks because in the U.S., we have very resilient resupply and in other European markets, we have very really resilient resupply in markets like France and Northern Europe. And so the number the differences you've seen in the groceries is actually driven by component supply and not by demand dynamics, if that makes sense. So it continues to be really almost unlimited demand for our products across the board. With devices obviously, in the U.S., we introduced AirSense 11. That freed up a lot of capacity for us. That's why we got such outsized growth relative to the other markets in the U.S. market this quarter. And the mask growth is pretty steady across all the markets.
Operator: Thank you. The next question today is from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Good morning, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on the guidance you've provided for the full year for the Philips share gains and that revenue contribution. The other companies obviously, what do you think is the underlying growth rate of the base business excluding that share gains? I guess, in other words, what were you expecting to grow the business by? How do you come up with that 200 to 250 million? And I guess, the question really is what do you expect of the base business to be able to grow up considering the supply constraints that are in the market at the moment? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes, Saul thanks, thanks for the question. And in looking at these estimates started about six months ago. I'll probably get Brett to give a little bit of detail around how we actually came up with the details of the calculations of the 300 to 350 and the 200 and 250. I'll give you the CEOs perspective first, and the CFO will come in and give more quantitative detail in a moment. But the way I looked at it, about six, eight months ago, it was I guess it was June, mid June when the competitor announced this. There were estimates on the sell side from 50 million of incremental revenue for ResMed during the fiscal year, up to 950 million from some of the sell side analysts and we thought that that range is just too broad. We generally don't get guidance we leave that to the job of the very smart people on the sell side and the buy side to do so. But that that variance was too big. And so we said, let's calculate it, let's take our forecast that we had at that time, eight, nine months ago for the fiscal year 22. And then look at what we think we can achieve based upon parts and components we can get into our factories and product we can make to take care of what is a seemingly infinite demand. So we'll just be rate limited on the parts and pieces. And we looked at mostly comms chips and some other electronic components would be rate limiting. And so we said, Okay, let's see how high we can ramp those with our great work from our ops team looking at ResMed 2030, 2035 and a brand new plant in Singapore, we actually weren't limited and aren't limited on manufacturing capacity, it was just about supply. And we estimated 300 million to 350 million in incremental revenue above our forecast growth. We didn't actually give a public number of what our forecast growth was. We just talked about that incremental revenue being there, letting sell side models for their forecast, add on to that in the 300 to 350. We've adjusted that to 200 to 250. So on top of whatever that growth was, we think it'll be 200 to 250. And that's really getting down to these. This last quarter Q4 gives a bit more detail on that. Brett, any further quantitative info, you want to give on that to Saul’s question there?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, thanks, Mick. I think we got that right. We saw really what we did is we looked at our pre-recorded forecasts, and it's very much an estimate on what we think that incremental demand was. And to your question kind of what would the underlying growth be? I mean, if you backed out that incremental revenue you'd get, you'd probably get Circa 10% growth on devices. So pretty, pretty strong.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: I just wanted to ask in regards to you mentioned the Astral, the Astral was not an allocation is unlimited or sorry, is not constrained. And you just talked about how that part is traveling and competitive and the competitive market with Philips being in our market and their products.
Mick Farrell: Yes Dan, thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. As I said in the prep remarks, we -- was our guiding principle that we take care of the sickest patients first and the highest security devices first. And the Astral is that and so we've done a great job. Our ops team supply chain team manufacturing team has done a great job. We are not supply constrained on that. And we are going head-to-head with the trilogy and Eva. And what I see, as regular leases of recalls and issues with our competitor in that space. And so not just our brand reputation and the amazing technology that's in the Astral, it's incredibly reliable and very high quality. And I believe we've been taking share there for a number of quarters. But Jim, you want to give detail on the Astral and how well that's doing U.S. and rest of the world?
Jim Hollingshead: Yes, thanks, Mick. Thanks, Dan. The Astral’s performing really, really well from a competitive point of view. We've taken share with the Astral it’s very very strong device offering. We've made a number of improvements to that platform over the last couple of years. And also remember that the Astral can be connected to an attachable modem, which can then allow patients using an Astral to be monitored in the cloud. And we have we have that capability now in our AirView platform worldwide. And so we've had a lot of a lot of adoption of monitoring ventilated patients in our AirView platform, especially a very strong growth in Europe with that offering. So Astral continues to perform extremely well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Matthew Mishan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just going back to the de-commit. Did you get a sense of why your orders were from over a year ago? We're de-committed and just how do you how did the semiconductor supply chain you know get unlocked over like the next three to six months? Like what are they telling you needs to happen incrementally so that you can get a steady or supply moving forward?
Mick Farrell: That's a great, great, great question. I'll talk a little bit about what our supply chain is doing. I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our CFO to go through the incredible work that Andrew Price and Linda Laidlaw our President of Global ops and the head of our supply chain are doing there. I can tell you what they're getting me to do. They're getting me to work with the CEOs of these of these companies and their heads of production. And you know, we're working and providing information to show the importance and how these technologies that they're providing and going into lifesaving medical devices. I actually created a video for the investors and the internal employees at one of our major electronic components suppliers to talk to them about how every chip they give us gives the gift of breath to a person who's suffocating and to really get that message through, I mean, I think you know in the huge demand for electric cars and, and cloud connected to consumer devices and an across the board demand is up across industries. And so it can be hard if you're a component maker to differentiate, industry A from B from C and and know where it's going. When they know firstly that we pay high margins that we have long term contracts that we’re recession resistant industries we showed through the global financial crisis. And the benefit for employees looking for purpose that, hey, this chip doesn't just go into a car that goes from A to B, or, or give cloud connectivity to a refrigerator. This thing literally keeps someone breathing and allows them and their doctor to see that breath and then improvement of incomes, reduction of costs and reduction in mortality. So getting that message through is really strong. We've been working very strongly since the starting gun sort of went off on this June last year, and we're getting better and better. But across the industry, Rob it's a tough environment for supply.
Rob Douglas: Yes, it is tough, Matt. And the way the electronics and semiconductor industry works is like any other industries, a number of players have gotten long term forecasts, which they need to have because the capital investments in order to build capacity takes a long time to develop. But I've really only got short term clarity on what the demand levels are going to be. And the actually the electronic industry has always been feast or famine for particular components. Like that this is just a worse than usual version of the usual situation. There was so much excess demand around the COVID environment. So many new dynamics, like as Mick mentioned, electric vehicles, taking up demand and consumer electronics and all that. And then the, the key suppliers have all their own inputs that have those sort of same investment issues coming. So they're also an allocation for their raw materials, as well. And then they have a number of contracts. And as Mick gets to it as if we can manage the priorities that these people have. And by the way, whenever we talked to almost anyone in any industry, we end up talking to somebody who either has sleep apnea, or their loved ones have sleep apnea, or their good friends have sleep apnea, so we can get a really strong message through as to why it should be a priority. But sometimes they've got contracts, and they need to be able to call force majeure on those contracts before they can supply us. So it's a very complex, complex project, we keep working on it. As Mick mentioned, we've got these other longer term projects that are really designing around the constraints and putting in options so that we can have what would traditionally single source components, we'd have options to multiple source components. We have many different communication modules that can operate in the, into the units now and different protocols. And we'll keep working on that. But it's not going to clear short term. And now we're going to need this great sort of agile performance from our supply team to really try and predict the areas of de-commit so that we can inform our engineering teams of what they should be designing around and get started on those key areas before they become problems. But these are tough problems to solve but we're working on it.
Mick Farrell: Yes. And in short, our goal will be with all that work that Rob just talked about to make sure we take three steps forward, so that when you do get the two steps back of this and that component, we're still moving forward sequentially every quarter throughout the year, and then really freeing up as Rob said, the long term stuff starts to come into fruition over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond. Thanks for the question, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick I might just follow up on those numbers, five areas of work. You mentioned sourcing validation and reengineering. Just wondering where progress sits relative to your plans? If there have been any benefit to date? And when do you think, these projects are expected to complete such that you do start to see the most benefits coming through?
Mick Farrell: David, it's a great, great question. And it's and it's really complex. And I'll probably hand to Rob to maybe give some of the detail on it. But those five lines of work have multiple projects within each of them. I tried to term like, new parts from new suppliers. That means our R&D team is reengineering, a new part validating, verifying, putting through all the quality tests, we're seeing in our market, how incredibly important that is, and we will not compromise on quality. And then you've got to validate and verify a new supplier and get them through. And so just one of those five lines of work is an incredible amount of work for our quality, regulatory, R&D, engineering, production and manufacturing teams. And so these aren't overnight. It's not like we're just having a cell phone here or a comms chip in a consumer device. This thing a life support then has to be working all day every day. A CPAP has to work every night and we are I think able to with all that work I mean as you saw, we got 200 million, 250 million this just this fiscal year ahead of incredible growth and our supply chain pivoted to all of that. If there hadn't been this competitive recall, we as an industry ResMed would have been absolutely able to do with every single supply chain constraint that had happened throughout this. And that's just speaks to the flex and the ability to go. We have these projects that have been going nine months, I actually think they're doing well. It's hard to say, even if I gave you on each of those five lines of work, the key milestones on it, there are probably five projects within each of those. So its sort of a 5 by 5, 25 point matrix. Rob's looking at this, Jim's looking at this on a daily basis. I get the updates every second or third day. As a CEO, I used to focus all my time just on customers talking to customers talking to health insurers and showing the benefit of our therapy, spending a lot more time with supply chain than I want to but right now, that's where the urgent need is. And for the next, 3, 6, 9, 12 months is where we're going to be focused. But at the same time, we're investing in demand gen. So that as the price starts to come back, and it will, and as a competitor comes back along, we can turn that demand gen back on securing all the share gains we've got through the digital entrenchment, and then drive for future growth. But Rob, how do you summarize all the other work we're doing for David succinctly here?
Rob Douglas: Yes, we David, we wouldn't break down all the individual projects. But no, I mentioned having multiple columns, protocols, multiple chips, multiple sources of chips. And to mix point, our issue around quality and patient safety is just so important. So we can't really take any undue risk or give any give on the quality of the validation processes. And making sure we're doing the right thing through all of that. So you can't just throw in a new component and say, let's see if it works. We've got to really do all the proper life testing and check through. So that's why it doesn't happen overnight. But the teams are working on it. And they said they're thinking about how to forecast the right areas, so that we can get on the front foot on these. Another important area is our ability to burst demand and burst supply, when we do get solutions come in, and you actually will see our inventory levels have increased. And that's interesting in a time, when really every product we make immediately delivered to customers and sold. And that's because we're working hard on making sure we've got all the raw material inventories, including longer term commitment with the suppliers, which actually we've had to do in order to guarantee short term supply. And so we've got very strong inventories of nearly everything, but a few that are short, but when those few ones shorts that were short come in, rather put them quickly into production and quickly get them on to patients.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Mike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about this character cloud device, sorry, Card-to-cloud device. Can you maybe comment on how that works? I assume that the collected data on the card and then has to be uploaded somehow. But and then, is there any kind of long term repercussions from having these out there in your installed base in terms of lost data over time or anything like that?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. And I'll hand to Jim to walk through some further detail on it. I can tell you look from ResMed, when we really first got into digital health in 2002, we had paging devices on experimental parts of our devices and 2005, we started to with the AirSense launch in 2006, 2007 I had some SD cards that were in those devices. And so we've sort of had this, this world of card-to-cloud at ResMed for well over a decade, 10 years, 15 years that we've had had the ability to do that type of technology. Obviously, with the AirSense 10, we changed the whole market. We did the sort of reverse Amazon play where we said 100% connectivity in the AirSense 10 through the comms chip. And then you take it seamlessly. And it's and it's taken to go there. Look, this is humanitarian emergency right now. We have a competitor out of the market, and there's not enough comms chips to go around the world. And we looked at this and said, well, look, why don't we go to where we were before, which is a great technology of Card-to-cloud. The differentiator for us is AirView that the doctors use, myAir that the patients use and the whole ecosystem of data. And so I think it's far more efficient and appropriate, then it goes straight in a secure end to end encrypted from the device there. But in this time of emergency for a period of time, who longs knows how long it will last, these AirSense 10 Card-to- clouds, a whole lot better patient getting that technology than one of the competitors out there that has some -- solution that may or may not be encrypted, who knows how it works, and the device not might not be as reliable. So the AirSense 10 is the second best device on the market, second only to the AirSense 11. So Card-to-cloud is out there. But Jim, you know, it's early days. How's it going?
Jim Hollingshead: It's very early days and we'll be bringing and we'll be bringing it to more and more geographies but you know to midpoint, we really just want to make sure patients get on therapy. I mean, that's, that's the driving rationale for launching. And this device is Card-to-cloud version residents. And it's basically in AirSense 10 without the cell chip. And so to, the process question Mike you asked is about, the devices all have SD cards in them. The SD card has to get to the provider. The provider uploads the data into the cloud. We've actually just re-launched or launched a renewed and better version of the process for doing that for the software that allows the upload into the cloud. And the great advantage of the whole system is that the patients still can be managed in AirView. And AirView is the best, patient management system on the market, we know that it has the strongest preference, the strongest performance, it's secure. It's encrypted and protects privacy, and, importantly, all have our customers using AirView right now in their workflows. And so that what the, the Card-to-cloud device is missing one step, which is the daily cloud uploaded data and via the system, the data will come into the system into the cloud, when the SD card gets uploaded by the provider. So and that I don't think anybody will do that on a daily basis, they'll do it relatively infrequently. The data is all there in the SD card. The device stores the data for months, so no data is lost. It's just the frequency of upload. And again, the main rationale behind it is we want to make sure patients get on therapy, there's a growing patient backlog, we can produce these devices at volume. And it gets around our biggest constraint, which is the communication.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Maggie on for Margaret. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask the incremental benefit guidance question a little bit of a different way. So obviously, supply constraints here are not allowing you to service all the patients out there. So you're reducing it by 100 million. So as the pie improves, and when it does, do you think that you will be able to recover that full 100 million in the next fiscal year, and even more than that? Thanks so much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for your question, Maggie. I mean, the short answer is yes, absolutely. Through not just the technology, Jim was talking about the essence, Card-to-cloud but all the other projects, Rob's been talking about the 5 by 5 25 plus matrix of incredible projects that are going through are going to free up supply. And sequentially as we go through this year, we're going to get growth and growth and growth. And so, just to be clear, it was on top of, as Brett said, strong sort of 10% forecast growth, we then had, in addition to that 300 million to 350 million of incremental, that incremental was reduced to 200 to 250, as we as we said today, for this fiscal year that we're in. But that incremental growth, those patients will be there. And we will be in the back when we will get to them in fiscal 23 and more as we continue to grow throughout the fiscal year 2023. It's not like this is an overnight success. And one of the 25 projects works tomorrow. We're all perfect. It's incremental, continuous improvement, step by step improvement of an amazing ops and supply chain team, and an amazing sales and delivery team working with customers on this allocation and understanding how to bring that product to market and understanding on the marketing side to just get ready for the demand gen that's going to need to happen to get all the backlog in and new patients in as we go in, throughout fiscal year 23 and beyond. But the short answer is Maggie. Yes, we will get to that increment and more throughout the coming 12, 18 months.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone. Hey Mick a lot of questions have been answered. Mick, if we layer a recessionary environment on top of an inflationary environment, can you just give us some guidance in terms of new order flow-through, patient behaviour, resupply orders, especially, it almost seems inevitable that there's another complicating factor on the horizon. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. Yes, look, I mean, clearly inflation is high. And as you've seen, that's been hitting, some of our areas of cost. We have some price mitigation on the AirSense 11. And on global surcharge, and some sort of skews across the range to deal with inflation and to share some of the pain of that that we are seeing from our suppliers with the channel. But so that's, that's how we're sort of mitigating the impacts of inflation. Your question about a future recession who knows we haven't a long bull market. One thing I know that ResMed and I was here through I was actually running the global sleep business through ’08, ’09 and ‘10. And I just taken over it the year before and ResMed is remarkably resistant to that global, that global financial crisis. And in recessionary environment, people may forego that extra Tesla, that extra phone for $2,000, but they will not forego that extra CPAP for $1,000 as much. And so we were very recession resistant through that last global financial crisis had a bull bull run here, globally for 10, 12 years, it is possible. Suraj, you're probably better at predicting the timing, or when a recession may come in the next 12, 24, 36 months, I don't know. But I know that as opposed to other consumer industries and automotive industries and fast moving consumer goods, medtech, and particularly consumer driven medtech, like ResMed and sleep apnea. We've been very recession resistant are a very strong player throughout that and give us a competitive advantage, I think of some of the other players fighting for the dollars available. But look, who knows what the timing of any of that would be. But we've got mitigation plans in for inflation. I think very good experience and capabilities to deal with downturns and or, and or recessions. But thanks for the question Suraj.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mick for any further closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Well thanks Kevin, for hanging the phone back. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to once again thank the 8000 ResMedians, many of you are also shareholders through our ESPP. So thank you for that for your dedication and your hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for what you do today and every day. I look forward to talking to you and all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, and we can now close the call.

I'll now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strong performance across our business, benefiting from the ongoing extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, as well as the steady recovery of markets from the peaks of COVID-19 impacts. We achieved double-digit growth in our business as we navigate three major externalities. On, the recovery of patient flow post the COVID maximum peaks; two, global supply chain constraints, particularly in electronic components; and three, the almost unlimited demand associated with a competitor recall that has actually extended further in terms of volumes of their devices that were impacted and the duration of their repair and replace process. The bottom line is we have at least 12 more months of this incredible demand for ResMed products. I'm very proud of 8,000 ResMedians serving patients in 140 countries worldwide. Our global teams are finding ways to deliver products and solutions to home care providers, physicians and healthcare systems, and ultimately into the hands of patients who need them most. Clearly, the global supply chain environment remains very challenging across multiple industries and we are not immune to its impact. During the quarter, despite growing double-digits year-on-year, we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market. We are being allocated components from our suppliers, particularly electronic components and even more specifically, semiconductor chips. And we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers. We have established an allocation process with clear guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of sea freight and air freight are impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we would like to the demand for ResMed products. Freight costs are increasing across the board on inbound components from suppliers and on outbound products to our distribution centers and for ultimate delivery to our customers. As a result of these increased costs, we implemented a surcharge on our products starting in January to share some of the burden of these increased costs with customers. Given all the increase in prices from commodities to special – specialty products across multiple industries around the world, the necessity of this surcharge has been understood and accepted by our customers. We are working closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything that we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We are also re-engineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, suppliers and accelerating new product launch and development to further catch up with the demand. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customers, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, health care systems and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who suffer from sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other respiratory chronic diseases, as well as those who benefit from our out-of-hospital health care software solutions. To grow and differentiate our sleep and respiratory care business, we will develop, design and deliver world-leading therapy solutions that can be scaled globally. And we're going to deliver the world's leading out-of-hospital software solutions to empower each person's health care wherever they are. Our goal is to ensure that every person gets the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let me step back to discuss the broad market conditions in our industry. We're seeing steady ongoing recovery of demand across the countries that we operate in. We are still seeing a divergence in the total patient flow from 85% to 100% of pre-COVID levels in most countries, and about 100% of pre-COVID levels in a few locations. These metrics will continue to steadily increase towards pre-COVID levels and beyond as vaccines and boosters roll out globally. Each new COVID variant has an impact. But with the adoption of digital health solutions for screening, diagnosis, and remote patient setup, and remote patient monitoring, as well as established and well-established processes for COVID cleaning protocols at sleep labs, we expect the impact of new variants to diminish in absolute impact each time. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state, and city governments, as well as local health care systems, hospitals, and health care providers to supply ventilators, masks, and training for acute care, and the important transition home as needed. Given the steadily decreasing severity of each impact on the hospitalizations and severe disease from COVID, the demand for ventilators is now consistent with pre-COVID levels. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. Number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Number two is to design, develop, and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally. And number three is to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. The US launch of our next generation device platform called AirSense 11 continues to go very well. This new platform has provided much needed additional product supply as we face all-time high demand for ResMed devices. We expect to introduce AirSense 11 platform into additional countries throughout calendar year 2022. In parallel, we will continue to sell our globally available market leading platform the AirSense 10 to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and bilevels [ph] available for sale. In fact, the only product that the AirSense 10 is inferior to is the AirSense 11. As you saw in our results, with double digit growth this quarter, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. With the AirSense 11 platform and our digital health technology ecosystem, we are engaging patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. We are also making it easier and more efficient for our customers to manage their patient populations using our full suite of software solutions, including myAir for patients, AirView for physicians and Brightree for home medical equipment providers. When customers use these digital health technology solutions, they have increased efficiencies, lower costs and we achieve improved outcomes for patients and their physicians. We have peer reviewed published evidence showing that combining AirSense platform with myAir software and AirView software, we see over 87% adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. This was in a study with over 85,000 patients. On our latest and greatest platform, AirSense 11, we are driving even higher adoption rates of the myAir than ever before. In fact, we are seeing more than double the uptake of patients signing up to myAir and fully engaging with ResMed software technology. The net result is that this delivers a better patient experience, better efficiency for the homecare providers and more importantly greater long term adherence to therapy. We saw this demonstrated in the Alaska study in partnership with the French healthcare systems where we showed in a study with over 176 patients that those patients who adhered to CPAP therapy had a 39% relative reduction in mortality rates versus control. Demonstrating these types of better patient outcomes and lower costs for the healthcare system at a scale not seen before in the industry are critical components of the ResMed 2025 strategy. Another key aspect of our long-term growth strategy is driving awareness and increasing the flow of patients through the top of the sleep apnea diagnosis funnel. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene, but also adoption acceptance of digital health and telehealth tools including home-based sleep apnea tests. Although increasing demand is not as important in the immediate short term giving the ongoing competitor recall, we have a long term focus and we're always focused on that long-term demand gen opportunity. We are innovating with partners and our customers to create an even more efficient and effective approach to sleep apnea patient identification, screening, diagnostics, treatment and management. We will continue to invest in technology that enables an end to end seamless digital experience for patients. As we mentioned in our October call, during the second quarter, we acquired Ectosense, a leading provider of cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology worldwide. We believe Ectosense’s digital and easy to use solutions in the hands of physicians, sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rates can help significantly increase both diagnostic and screening rights as well as general sleep apnea awareness. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide and the 330 million patients that suffer from asthma worldwide. Our goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions from our Propeller technology and high flow therapy offerings, such as our product platform called Lumis HFT. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the US where providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with the guiding principles of our allocation process, namely, to give the highest priority to manufacturing life support ventilation and noninvasive ventilation devices, including by levels that meet the needs of these highest acuity patients first. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago remains solid, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. AirView for ventilation has provided value by helping physicians and the health care systems they operate in to manage high risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is also increasingly being used on an ongoing basis to enhance quality of care through early and proactive intervention at the first sign of respiratory medical issues to help reduce the risk of hospitalization. We see a world where We see a world where AirView ventilation is standard of care for COPD, the way that our core sleep apnea AirView platform is now standard of care for sleep apnea treatment. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business showed improved sequential growth. We achieved high single digit growth year-on-year across our portfolio of SaaS markets including home medical equipment as well as facilities based and home based care settings. The continued growth of home based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment as well as our home health and hospice products and we continue to grow with customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care, including Brightree and SNAP ReSupply. The COVID-19 pandemic has been and remains challenging for some of the verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities as the effects of the highly contagious Omicron variant remains a headwind for patient volumes in these settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID rates peak and then decline with this latest variant as has happened in many regions around the country and around the world. As COVID restrictions continue to ease and our customers improve their line of sight to better conditions, we expect to see pent-up demand for technology investments, which provides opportunities for us to sell more and more services and solutions to existing customers, as well as to increase our new customer pipeline. As we look at our portfolio of solutions across care settings, we expect our SaaS group revenue to growth to accelerate, achieving sustainable high single digit growth as we exit this fiscal year. As always, our growth, our goal is to meet or beat that market growth rate as we continue to innovate and continue to take market share from competitors. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care and we provide mission critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. Our latest and greatest SaaS solutions address the number one issue reported across our customer base which is staffing challenges. Our SaaS customers expect this problem to persist and they recognize the need for technology solutions to help solve their challenges with efficiency and scale and our software services and solutions help them achieve both of these outcomes. We are well-positioned and we have created differentiated value for our customers and for ResMed within our SaaS business. Looking at the broader portfolio of ResMed's businesses across sleep and respiratory care, as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our sleep and respiratory care solutions treat the most prevalent and highest cost chronic conditions and our SaaS solutions support the care settings where people face these and other chronic conditions. With this combination, we can fundamentally transform out of hospital healthcare at a scale that no other company can match. And we have set up for sustainable growth through ongoing investments in R&D to the tune of 7% of our revenues, commercial excellence in partnerships with CVS verily and beyond, as well as future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as tuck-in M&A as we move forward. Our patient centric − physician centric and provider centric approach combined with our unique ResMed culture means that we are positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved medical markets of sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and beyond. We are transforming out-of-hospital healthcare at scale, leading the market in digital health technology with over 10.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 16 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are unlocking value by using de-identified data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems. We have invested in the privacy, cloud operations and AI and ML-driven data or analytics capabilities to do this at a scale that is unmatched by competitors, and we are increasing our lead every day. Our mission to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that inspiring goal during this last quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 8,000 residents for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication during these ongoing, unprecedented times. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move to the group for Q&A. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, unless noted, all comparisons out of the prior year quarter. We're pleased with our financial performance in Q2, despite the headwinds we faced as a result of significant ongoing supply chain constraints and the challenging freight environment. Group revenue for the December quarter was $895 million, an increase of 12%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Revenue growth reflects increased demand for our sleep and rest free care products across our portfolio, driven by recovering market conditions and by increased device demand in response to the ongoing product recall by one of our competitors. In the December quarter, we recorded immaterial incremental revenue from our COVID-19 related demand, consistent with revenue from our COVID-19-related demand, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. However, we will continue to estimate it for you as appropriate. In relation to the impact of our competitor’s recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the December quarter. For the first half of our FY 2022, this reflects incremental revenue in the range of $125 million to $145 million. We continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the total incremental device revenue opportunity to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for the full fiscal year 2022. As we shared last quarter, we expect our fiscal third quarter to remain supply constrained, similar to our fiscal second quarter, therefore limiting incremental revenue during the third quarter. We see supply challenges to some extent easing in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal year 2023. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, sales in the US, Canada and Latin America countries increased by 14%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 12% in constant currency terms. By products segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 16%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada and Latin America increased by 19% as we benefited from incremental revenue due to a competitor's recall and favorable product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices. This is consistent with our guiding principles for product allocation, namely that we are giving priority to the production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. Mask and other sales increased by 9%, Masks and other sales increased by 9%,, reflecting solid resupply revenue and achieved despite the challenging device supply environment, which continues to limit new patient set ups. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales increased by 13% in constant currency terms, again reflecting the benefit from incremental revenue due to a competitive recall. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets benefited from improved patient flow relative to the prior year and increased by 11% in constant currency terms. Overall, our Asian operations in particular delivered a strong quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue increased by 8% in the December quarter. We saw strong performance of the HME segment as customers continue to utilize our SaaS solutions to streamline and more efficiently run their businesses. And we are seeing some stability in the skilled nursing care segment as it continues to emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of fiscal year 2022, we expect to continue to benefit from our competitors’ inability to supply new patients and from the global fleet markets general recovery from COVID-19 impacts. However, as we have said in the last few quarters, while we are working hard to increase device output, we will not be able to meet all expected demand resulting from our competitors’ recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. We are operating a very dynamic supply chain environment. As I stated earlier, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in the first half of fiscal year 2022. We expect Q3 to remain challenging but Q4 to be better. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 230 basis points to 57.6% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher freight, component, and manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency movements, partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses, during Q2, we maintained a disciplined approach in our ongoing spend to support our operations. But we are seeing a more normalized expenditure profile as COVID-19 impacts subside. SG&A expenses for the second quarter increased by 9% or, in constant currency terms, increased by 10%. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. Importantly, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to 21.2% in the prior-year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the second half of FY 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter increased 14% on both a headline and a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue of 7% compared to 6.9% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product, and solutions development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the second half of FY 2022. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter increased by 5%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by the contraction of our gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 15% while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% compared to the prior year quarter of 15.2%. The relatively low tax rate in Q2 in both the current quarter and prior year quarter reflects a favorable tax benefit associated with employee equity vesting that typically occurs in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter increased by 5% and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 4%. Now cash flow from operations for the quarter was $220 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by higher working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends to shareholders totaling $61 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the premise on joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $109.4 million. At December 31, we had $680 million gross debt and $496 million net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and at December 31, we had approximately $1.6 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our operating performance. As our cash flow and low leverage provide flexibility in how we allocate capital going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We also expect to continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions, such as Citus Health and Ectosense, an acquisition we completed on October 1. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, let's go ahead and now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Cooper: Afternoon. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Mick, can you just remind us, please, of the specific measures you're employing to mitigate the component supplier challenges? And I guess where you're seeing more and less success.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Chris, thanks. It's a very pertinent question, obviously, and we're pursuing multiple paths, as I outlined in the prep remarks we're focusing on – the first thing we're doing is going to our existing suppliers and existing supply chains and really imploring them to prioritize medical devices over the other aspects. They have choices to give to electric cars, cellular phones, consumer devices and medical devices. And we are working with them directly on that. We're seeing some benefit on that, certainly at the level of maintaining the sort of double-digit growth that you saw during this quarter. In addition to that, we are redesigning parts and pieces and components within our existing platforms, and we're bringing new platforms to market faster. So we're working on our Air 10 designs and Air 11 designs. We're also re-engineering our supply chains to validate and verify new suppliers to be able to get there. And so that whole combination gives us a lot more confidence that as we look to March quarter to get better than December but then June quarter to get significantly better than March. And then as we go through September and December of this calendar year, we really start to free up a lot of those projects come into play and we're seeing a lot of confidence with them. But you know, over that portfolio, Rob, do you have any more information to provide maybe Chris, around what we're doing with supply chain and parts?
Rob Douglas: Maybe only also, Chris, this has sort of been going on for a year now and we knew these shortages were going to be coming. So our teams have been working on all those activities that Nick's been talking about throughout the year, starting to bear fruit. It does take time and that's why we're talking about sort of, you know, things don't fix immediately. We're talking about its continuing to be challenging for this coming quarter and starting to see improvement further out. That said, you know, it's a very dynamic situation and things do change on a weekly basis and so our teams have to be extremely agile and we've got − we're actually putting a lot of resources into it, got a really strong team of engineers and commercial relationship people with the suppliers and our product teams are all really focused on this as we work through these challenging times.
Chris Cooper: So can, I mean, relative to the update you were providing in the last quarter results in October. Are you now more or less confident that the deficits that you're currently seeing in components can be addressed by the fourth quarter?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, it's a good question, Chris. I'm actually precisely where I was in October that, you know, I think we said in October it's going to be tough in December, it's going to be tough in March and really start to open up in June and then as we go out throughout the calendar year. So, I stand by that and I stand as Brett said earlier, looking at fiscal 2022 the $300 million to $350 million of incremental product. Look at the December quarter, 16% growth year-on-year in devices amongst a global supply chain crisis, COVID-19 recovery, all the challenges that are here. That’s really strong. But we’re going to get stronger than that as we go throughout the fiscal and as we go throughout the calendar year. This seemingly infinite demand is going to be with us for the whole of this calendar year and potentially beyond that. And so we – all the projects that Rob talked about, if the starting gun went off sort of June 14, when the competitor put this recall notice in field safety, notices globally out, our team have done a pretty darn good job getting to 16% year-on-year in this crisis on the December quarter. I think it will get – as I said in October, I think it will get better in March and then December and significantly better in June and then really start to free up as we hit September and December. And with almost infinite demand, you never quite catch up to that. But we're going to get faster and faster and grow more year-on-year as we go throughout the calendar year.
Chris Cooper: Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much. Mick, you mentioned that ventilation demand is back at pre-COVID levels, but I presume you're talking about the hospital events or hospital patients. So, I was hoping you can give us some color detail on ventilation into the home healthcare market and specifically how the Astral product has performed whilst the explosion of rains [ph] over the last couple of quarters.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dan. I'll have a first stab at it and then hand to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of Sleep and Respiratory Care. Yeah. So what I’ve said in the prep remarks is that what we're seeing is that the demand for ventilators is really around that COPD neuromuscular disease, respiratory insufficiency markets are where they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. So that we're seeing that flow of sick patients finding their way through digital health solutions, telehealth monitoring, digital work with their pulmonary and/or COVID cleaning particles in labs for their pulmonary physicians. We’re getting the prescription for those products. The vast majority of our revenues, 90-plus percent globally on respiratory care are out-of-hospital respiratory care. So even Astral and Astellas and WSTs [ph], FTAs, FTs and AFEs, they’re used for ventilation outside the hospital. So those seem to be back in terms of patient flow. Jim, any further color to provide Dan on that?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Nick said is that our Astrals product is performing really well in the market. It's got very sophisticated algorithms that can treat a wide range of patients, and demand for it has been really strong. And so, in general, the Astrals have been very well accepted and some of the algorithms we've added over the last several months have driven demand upward. It's also benefiting from the for what is for us to tailwind from the Philips recall. And so, there's a bit of incremental demand for Astral in that context as well.
Dan Hurren: Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Operator: Guys, your next question is coming from Sean Gorman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Sean Laaman: Dave Pendarvis, do you have any to – Good morning, Mick and team. Hope you're all right. Well, Mick, I'm hoping we could get an update on the new RTM cuts from CMS and how that might be influencing our Propeller.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. It's a great question, and as you know, Propeller technology is for those who may not know a cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery product for both COPD and asthma, and a lot of those are in pilot stage and the partnerships with governments in Europe and private payers in the United States. And so, we are – do have some commercial models going. They're not material to the global business, but, Dave Pendarvis, do you have any data about RTM codes that we've got through reimbursement and any impacts on those for Propeller and across the business?
Rob Douglas: Yeah. Well, generally, we're happy to see coding and reimbursement flow towards more remote monitoring type activity. That's a positive. At the same time, Propeller is working both to have physician adoption of those codes, and we're working to see the funding come through with that, and nothing changes quickly in terms of medical practice and Propeller is also working with health care systems and other system-wide bases to try to adopt to Propeller system. So, I'd say we're encouraging, but it's still a little early in the day for us to say we're seeing material uptake for Propeller as a result. But certainly, it improves the operating conditions. And we think this is a long-term trend that will benefit Propeller as well as the rest of the business and its remote patient monitoring in the long run.
Mick Farrell: Yeah.
Sean Laaman: Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Matthew Mishan: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. You saw a sequential improvement quarter over quarter in US masks. Can you give us a sense of what the drivers of that are and whether or not you expect continued sequential improvement moving forward?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. And it's great to see US, Canada, Latin America, or the strong 9% constant currency growth on masks and Europe, Asia, rest of world at 11% year on year with a strong double-digit 10% growth. Well, one and as you said, that is up from last year. Look, I think I'll start in maybe hand to Jim for some more color. But at the broad level, COVID-19 has shown the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. And we said this in 2020 when we saw that sort of uptick of the growth of our masks and accessories business. And we just launched Snap and we have rightly resupply and a lot of people thought, well, this is the second was step up, it's just up. While people like, there were people with stockholdings and some commodity products. This is a stockholding issue. We said, no, this is sustainable. We’re talking to patients. We’re doing the net promoter score. We’re analyzing data consumers want and always wanted to more health care. They've now seen the reason for respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. We’re now two years into this and we are seeing sustained growth at the patient level demand for respiratory health, respiratory hygiene. We're adding to that the technology from SNAP, technology from Brightree but in other parts of the world with those technologies aren't there, we're partnering with our home care providers with patients directly and beyond to encourage and make that happen. But Jim, any further color on the sustainability of this, this strong margin?
Jim Hollingshead: I think the mix just listed a couple of tailwinds are related to, I do think patients have changed their behavior in the context of COVID and are much more keen to get clean, refreshed consumables and their experience. And I think our customers worldwide have gotten better at providing that and the US market in particular, there's a very strong push on resupply and has been for months. And so that's, that's a tailwind. There's always a Q2 cyclicality tailwind because of deductibles. So that's a normal cyclical thing but the other thing I think is really important to point out is that our mask portfolio is performing really, really well. We have the – we do have the widest range of masks available to fit really almost any patient experience. We continue to take share, I think, which is a really important dynamic for us. So not massive shocking movement but incrementally, we continue to take a bit of share over the last two or three quarters, we've taken, we've taken sequential share and so that's been really good. The only headwind on mask is the filter recall, because the filter recall is dampening new patient starts. And so that's, that's a tiny headwind against four or five tailwinds that we've just listed and we feel really confident about our mask portfolio going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now live.
Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just a question on US device sales. I was wondering if you could provide any comments on the split there between AirSense 11 and AirSense 10 and how that kind of proportion of sales between the two might compare to the first quarter?
Mick Farrell: Craig, it's a pertinent question but it's one we don't feel comfortable going into the details of. What I can tell you as an equal one personal user of this AirSense 11 platform is that the delivery is smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. My wife actually asked me if it was on when I turned it on, it is that much smaller, quieter and better than our last generation already the leading platform. So, what I can tell you is it is taking off every single AirSense 11 we can make is sold that day. It comes out of the factory, it's already pre-sold and they are moving fast. And so it is increasing as a portion of our US sales. For competitive reasons we're not going to split out how quickly that S curve is coming up. But the points I made in the prep remarks are really strong. The AirSense 10 on its own is the second best product in the market after only the AirSense 11. So it is already there and every AirSense 10 we can get component for and then put through the production line get sold as well. So we’re selling both in parallel and customers are demanding both and we'll take both over any of the competition. And so we're driving those out there. We're driving great growth of both and we will do throughout all calendar year 2022 as Philips recall will last at least that long in their update just this week. And so, you know, 90 days ago it was 12 months ending in September. We were ready for that scenario. They'll come back in September and get our great mask uptake as Jim was saying earlier. We're now ready for their new scenario which is December and we're ready to expand our components and our share on the device side and driving as much as that demand as is possible. So, we're ready for all the scenarios of all the above. But yeah, we're not going for all the scenarios that will be involved. But, yeah, we’re not going to break down the exact AirSense 11 versus AirSense 10. I can tell you it’s growing extraordinarily fast. The S-curve uptake is great, and patients are loving it. So, throughout calendar year, we will introduce it to other countries around the world, and we expect the same sort of level of uptake in those other countries.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Paine from CLSA. Your line is now live.
Andrew Paine: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanting to get a bit more clarity on your ability to reengineer parts and redesign elements in your devices. How is that going to be achieved, and does this mean you won't be as exposed to chip shortages from 4Q and onwards? And when do you think these changes will allow you to be running at full capacity and, in essence, meeting current demand?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Andrew, great three-part question. I'll start with it, and then maybe, Rob, you can cover anything I missed of Andrew's components there. But, look, yeah, the starting gun went on this project in April when they said there was a quality issue, June when they said there was a recall. We were already ready for the supply chain shortages that COVID-19 would drive, and if this recall from our competitor hadn't happened, we would be able to meet all the existing demand. As you saw, we grew 16% year-on-year in this quarter, and that would have been great growth, taking some good share in the core competitive market. But with that starting gun going off in June, we did start those reengineering projects. We said, look, we are not going to be able to just go back and ask for more supply. We know the supply chain constraints. We know the automotive industry, cellular comms, and others are all screaming for more products, too. And so we started those reengineering of components and parts. We started also reengineering these Six Sigma Black Belts, looking at our supply chain and analyzing different suppliers and revalidating and assuring that we could get them there. And so there's a bunch of projects going on. I run out of fingers looking at them. But when I look at that portfolio, it gives me strong confidence to say, we saw some good – some of them come to fruition in December some more in March. But in the June quarter, I think a bunch of these projects will free up supply and then you hit September and December and the portfolio projects that are going to get to market in terms of the new supply, a new piece and new redesign will get there. And that's what gives us that confidence in that, that recovery and the amount of share we're going to take through 2022. Rob, what did I miss there? Maybe just going to some of the sort of the reengineering processes. As you know these – Andrew, these products have hundreds of components in them. And if you're missing one, you can't build any of the products. So you'll actually see us as we build buffers around all of this, we will see our inventory levels of materials go up as we build buffers of these alternatives. Now some of the components they're easy to have as alternatives. You've got to revalidate them. And in the medical device world, you've got to have very rigorous revalidation alternate components. And that's often a lot of the engineering work. But some of the other components like the microcontrollers and things like that, they are a lot more complex. They interact with the embedded software on the systems, all of that type of thing, the design and validation processes for those are more complex and do take more time. We've got projects across all of those areas going on there. And as we make these alternatives, then we're scheduling, the longer term commitments, the relationships with the suppliers, building the inventories and making sure we have options. That said, keep coming back to the sector is a very variable situation. And just when you think you've got everything right, then you start seeing the other components be challenges. So I think as I said earlier, you have to be really agile and keep competing on – keep running really fast to track these issues.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live.
John Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I'm just trying to get a bit more color around the underlying the underlying new patients, maybe between US and the rest of the world. And just give us a sense of where you think we’re at in different markets and perhaps some – since when you think it might get back to the patient growth during the 2019?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, John it's a very complex question because as you know, we operate in 140 countries and all the different Greek letter variants of COVID flow through those 140 countries at different rates. One great thing because we have strong visibility and awareness into this as we talk to the pulmonary and critical care physicians and we watch hospitalization rates and ventilation usage rates and ICU usage rates as each variant seems to be – although more and more communicable less and less severe and the impact in terms of hospitalizations, severe need for ventilatory help and death. And so the work that we did in 2020 and 2021 establishing these digital protocols, home sleep apnea, testing protocols that pulmonary doctors who previously hadn't done telehealth visits are now doing them. Doctors who weren't embracing ApneaLink Air or some of the NOX digital diagnostics components have embraced them throughout 2020 out of necessity and then 2021 out of scale. So as we enter 2022 here, we're feeling very comfortable across those 140 countries. I gave you in prep remarks the sort of wide band, right? 85% to 100% of pre-COVID patient flow, depending on the country, the city, the location. There are some as I said in the prep remarks, there are some locations that are above 100%. And I won't go into detail -- North Rhine-Westphalia this quarter of Bavaria, Southern France, Southeast of the US this quarter, what we're seeing is as variants come down, those protocols go. We're hitting those – if you take 2019 as the base year, we're hitting those 100% triple digit rates in some locations. And so gives us a lot of confidence because we’re – the beauty of, the beauty is we're in all 140 countries. So that portfolio, I feel every 90 days, we’re seeing positive movement. Even though a particular location might go back two steps and one might go forward three steps, on aggregate, we’re seeing sort of one step forward for ResMed as we look across that portfolio every 90 days. That's why we're able to see this great, strong 16% device growth across our region. It's not only share-taking. There's some good flow of patients coming through. What worries me a little bit, John, is actually some of the backlog that might be happening in the system due to our competitor just not being in the market for 18 months, right? In aggregate, according to their call this week, it would be 18 months from June 2021 through to December 2022. That backlog of patients, we can't get them all, right? We're ramping up, as Rob said, doing everything we can to ramp up. We're not going to get them all. And so that backlog of patients, even when our competitor comes back, is going to have to flow through the system. So this is not just an effect that's over the day our competitor is back. There's going to be a number of quarters where ResMed is going to grow, take share, and deal with this flow of patients through there. So although we're pushing very strong around our long-term demand gen, we're not turning up the dials yet on driving the top of the funnel because, frankly, the top of the funnel is full and growing and will do for the next 12 months.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning, all. More of a medium-term question, Mick. So as the industry isn't able to meet the demands of new patients at the moment, what are you doing to ensure that patients don't fall off the waiting list? And I guess do you see any risk here that the industry will see slower growth in the medium term from all the disruption over this 12-, 24-month period? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a first go at it and hand to Jim. I mean, the short answer to your question is absolutely not. I do not see any growth slowing down. In fact, the backlog, certainly for ResMed, I see incredible growth coming for our industry. And a lot of the demand gen stuff I talked about, and we talked about on our Investor Day with CVS partnerships on the brick and mortar side in the front line. And then on our Verily partnership premised, on the front line, we are not turning the dollars on that demand gen up and we don't need to through 2022. But we will start to put on the map in 2023. And I think what we'll see is the backlog will come in – and our demand gen will come in and we'll actually post-COVID see a faster growth rate of our industry because of all the learnings of digital health, home sleep apnea testing, seamless and digital end to end journeys for patients. It's got better for patients when they get into the system. The trouble is now competitor can't provide the therapy at the end and that does create a bit of a backlog. But I think on the other side of this, we'll actually see increased secular growth. That mid to high single digit growth for our industry might move up 50 basis points, 100 even more basis points because of the embracement of digital net net. But Jim, anything to go to Gretel’s question around industry growth there?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, Gretel, I guess I would, I would just add a couple of things. The first one is we're working really hard with our channel partners to understand the dynamic of patient wait lists and working really hard with physicians on that. And so, we’re – as you know we're prioritizing higher acuity patients, higher acuity conditions with our with our production. But we know that there are kind of straight OSA patients out there, they're facing longer waitlists and we're working with our customers to try to reduce those wait times and to better manage an understanding of when we can deliver product to which customers are so. So that's just sort of a general thing we're trying to do. I think the other thing that will help us to drive growth on an ongoing basis is we're working right now on programs that will allow us to capture patients who may be faced a long waitlist. And I don't want to go to great detail on that but our marketing teams in our main countries are working on those programs right now. And as we have more supply, we feel pretty confident we'll be able to run programs that will be able to reengage patients that maybe have, they're tired of waiting or something like that. So we think we'll be able to capture a big, big part of that backlog, which there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog, which I – if there is a backlog and we think there'll be an even bigger backlog as that goes forward. And the last thing I would add is, we're pretty active in developing new channels. And so, those are those are new and growing areas for us. But if you think about something like CVS Health hubs, there's a new channel that that continues to grow, CVS continues to invest there. That's a new way for patients to be reminded that they were diagnosed with OSA or to be reminded that they might need resupply. And CBS is just one example where we're working in new channels. We're doing that not just in the US, but in multiple markets around the world. So we're going to expand the ability to reach of different channels for patients to get treated. And we'll be – we're accelerating those now. We'll be accelerating those programs even more as production comes up to higher volumes and we're able to treat more patients.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey Capital. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Good morning and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe one for Rob. Rob, just on the discussion around semiconductors and the shortages, can you talk to us about the line of sight you get as it relates to the inflow of those chips and then the manufacturability? In other words, is it still taking circa three months to process devices? And so, are you in a position now to know what your volume on flow generators is looking like into fourth quarter because you have these chips either sitting with you now or they're due to come in over the next few weeks? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Actually, as I was saying earlier, we've actually had to greatly extend our forecast lead times for it to get the supply commitments that we want, actually multi-year. So at that level, we have a long, long view. The year – our cycle times are actually pretty short. The longest part of our cycle time and variable part of it is freight. And so, a lot of the challenges of forecasting sales on a weekly basis is what's happening to any freight that's stuck off Los Angeles or something like that. Now, we can mitigate that at a cost with air freight, and we do that, but we certainly can't do a 100% on freight. And so we're trying to balance up those sort of freight demands and that does create a variability. So the hardest thing for predicting what's going to – what we're forecasting over the next couple of weeks is actually those freight deliveries. Our internal systems around delivering them out of our warehouses are extremely slick and really run well, and we've got great teams in those warehouses. Our factory capacity, we typically run a policy of having significant burst capacity in these factories. And as we've said before, we’ve just invested in a major new factory in Tuas in Singapore. We're – out of that factory, we would normally have the capacity to meet all of the industry demand. So we can actually push stuff through that system really quickly. The key issue is that variability and the propensity of the suppliers to meet their commitments. Now, they'll do everything they can to meet their commitments. But actually, some of those freight issues, they have the same issues. They have the same issues of allocation from their suppliers. And so we have to manage all the way through all of those layers to get there. So it's a long answer. But really, the main factor is the suppliers and the short-term variability of freight.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Yeah. Good morning, all. I guess you’ve spoken about volume in detail, but can we talk about price and provide some color on the trends you're seeing in average device prices this quarter and perhaps with some reference to mix and discounting, if you can.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Lyanne. It's a good question. And traditionally we don't talk much about price at all. But one thing I will say is that we announced it in our prep remarks – my prep remarks here today that we have a surcharge now on all ResMed devices. There are such as with exactly with the last question from Sol [ph] where Rob was showing that increased air freight and sea freight costs of 5X or 10X what they were, air freight was always a significant factor of above sea freight and it's got more expensive too and so all of that has meant that we had to provide that surcharge to our patients. So we haven't done a price increase as some of our competitors have to the customers but we have put a − we have put a surcharge on devices starting in January. Our customers have accepted it. I mean, you know, the people running these companies go to a supermarket and see the price of milk or the price of whatever commodities that they're purchasing in their daily lives going up in price. And so a surcharge from us given the nature of this has made sense to them. And so, you know, your question was what's the levels of price discounting? There is no product discounting right now. In fact, we're taking away some of the early pay and some of the other factors that were there that were non price related but the impact is sort of cash flow there because it's very important in an environment like this to make sure that the costs are shared in a fair and equal way through the supply chain and we're doing that through a surcharge. But as I see it, you know, the mix side, the second part of your question. We're following our guiding principle on allocation here. If we have limited chips and parts and pieces, we will make an Astral before [ph] before an echo of STA and ST and ASP and so on down to an APAP and CPAP. And so the mix, you know, can lead to some sort of ASP mix increases on that but any individual like-for-like product we’re keeping the prices where they are because we're in a steady, reimbursed environment, our customers we have relationships going back decades. We want them for decades for the future and we really value those relationships. And so we're really focused on this sort of temporary surcharges is going to be associated with those increased costs we have and any impact on ASP is really around mix towards those higher acuity products.
Operator: Thank you. Our question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden Australia. Your line is now live.
Steve Wheen: Yeah. Thanks very much. I've got a somewhat related question for Brett just with regards to the gross margin. So I was just wondering if you could help us sort of break into that number a little bit particularly from the point of view of the next few quarters. So I'm trying to put into context the surcharge as to what sort of effect that will have. And then there's obviously other drivers which all look quite positive like FX mix, maybe the [indiscernible] pricing. So if you could sort of maybe comment on any of that. And then lastly, maybe a headwind, is there any pricing pressure coming from the semiconductors suppliers to you guys ? So yeah, if you could help me unpackage that gross margin that would be great.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks. Steve. Now, let me try to unpack that a little bit here. On the gross margin, if you look at it year-on-year-year, pretty big decline and really freight was the big one and logistics costs. Some component cost increases coming in and also manufacturing because they really had to optimize on the manufacturing front. At the moment, we were just trying to make sure we can really maximize output rather than efficiencies. So that's playing out that played out year-on-year-year. If you look at it sequentially, not in quite good shape, a little bit of an increase there sequentially actually. If you go forward, we're still going to have freight and logistics costs coming through. I mean, that's still going to be, I think, a headwind for I think for the rest of this calendar. FX probably relatively neutral as we look forward and I think ASP declines won't –we've typically had that but I don’t think we’ll see that going forward. We have the surcharge. It’s only a small surcharge. And we're only – we're not recovering anywhere near our increasing cost there but we're – as Mick said we're looking to share that. So they're kind of – they're still with us. There are some headwinds there. We've got AirSense11 coming through, which is at a price premium but that's only in the US market at the moment. But taking the medium term view, that'll be supportive. But the other one to call out is as particularly in Q4, as we increase the output or the volumes from the supply constraints easing and we'll have higher revenue there. But in a relative sense, it'll be more of the kind of lower acuity in terms of that mix. So that one will be a little bit of a headwind, so the product mix won't be as beneficial as it has been. So there’s puts and takes there. But that's how kind of how see it at the moment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is live.
David Bailey: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. You sort of touched on this in part of your earlier remarks. But I just wanted to confirm that you're confident that some of the changes in relation to digital initiatives over the past couple of years will allow the system to deal with the backlog of new patients over the medium term.
Mick Farrell: Yes, David. It’s a really pertinent question. And I feel very confident. And we've watched it. Before this recall was announced, through to June 2021, we saw great adoption for 18 months of all the digital solutions from doctors getting involved in telehealth to the adoption of identification, engagement, enrollment and diagnostic systems on a digital basis. In countries where, like in Germany, where it would obviously be interesting was less than 10% of the total diagnoses in 2019. It went to huge double digits throughout 2020 10% of the total diagnosis in 2019, it went to huge double digits throughout 2020, and it stayed quite high despite the reopening with COVID-cleaning particles of sleep labs throughout Germany. And so, I think as you look an aggregate, David, that adoption that happened in the last two years will be a huge impact, permanent adoption of digital health screening tools. And as Jim said, as we open up new channels, we're going to roll that digital end-to-end solution through multiple new funnels to get patients into the funnel through the early partnership with Prim [ph] through our CVS partnership. And they're the two public ones in the US, but we're doing, as Jim said, stuff in the other 140 countries that are more a partnership basis partnership basis with the UK government, with the NHS. Some great information from our UK team I was looking at over the last week, incredible work in our Northern Europe team. Our Western European team, the partnership with the French government. I talked about the ALASKA study that's just the peer reviewed, published evidence that's out there. We're doing stuff on the ground that we're not talking about publicly, but it has incredible adoption of digital health technologies in conjunction with the French Social Security system, supporting that through high reimbursement of cloud connected CPaaP versus non-cloud connected CPaaP. Because they see the results, they see high adherence, they see better outcomes, they see lower costs, not only death rate, lower death rate of those we'll see proper but lower hospitalization, so it saves lives and saves money. So, David, it's a permanent adoption. I think it will improve our efficiency as an industry, as we get into 2022, 2023 here and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon, and good morning to you, sir. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the math that you guys had implied from the benefit of the competitive recall. And if we sort of keep the fiscal Q3 benefits similar to what we saw in fiscal Q2, maybe pick it up a little bit, the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds the fiscal Q4 benefit sounds like it's going to be, $130 million, $140 million or so at the midpoint of your range. So as we think about that with Philips extending the timing of the impact of the recall, should we be using that $140 million as a base benefit as we go into the second half of the calendar year, especially given that it sounds like even at that range, the demand maybe isn't fully satisfied. And so, theoretically go higher especially with the underlying market improvements.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Margaret it's a great question and I'm not going to get into sort of the detailed breakdown of the $350 million through the fiscal year. But as you said, look at it is, back end loaded in terms of Q4 is going to be the lion's share of that, of that because all the projects that Rob talked about earlier will come to fruition in June, September and December. And so the only guidance I think I've given in the last nine years as CEO was around this $350 million on the revenue side there for fiscal 2022. So I'm not going to go into 2023. We did that because the models were quite wide there on the benefit from this recall on the sell side for as low as $50 million to as high as $950 million. So we wanted to right set it at $300 million to $350 million. We're still comfortable with that for fiscal 2022. But as you look for fiscal 2023, look, I do think that the share that we're taking this year will be long term sustainable share. When we go in and take share, we don't just go into a competitive account and say, great, here's your product, good. We work with people who are adopting existing relationships with people who are adopting Maya for their patients, getting that 60%, 70% uptake that we've seen with AirSense 11. They're working with AirView. All their physicians are on the cloud platform, getting that efficiency. They’re using Brightree and they're partnering up in the United States and beyond. So that digital end to end, it becomes a very sticky platform because the value is so strong. They lower their labor costs by 50%, setting up the device, they improve adherence to 87% for their patients and their physicians and it becomes permanent. So I do think that the share we're taking will be long term sustainable. do think that the share we're taking will be long-term sustainable. When our competitor comes back, they're going to have to go after the low-priced people first that don't have all that digitally end to end. When they try to come after us, we're going to be so far ahead with 18 months’ worth of digital health innovation and all the work that we're doing to partner with physicians, patients, and providers. I look forward to it. We were winning this football game before we got the penalty kick. It's like we were the Kansas City Chiefs and we were up 42 to 0, and then we got a penalty kick, and then we're up 45 to 0. It doesn't – we didn't need the penalty kick to get there, so I still think we'll win on the other side of this. But having said that, we're not going to give guidance around 2023, but everyone will have their models. I think that certainly with that competitor being out for the calendar year, we're going to take incredible share this calendar year. I think as they come back, the nine brand will be different. They'll have to start from the ground up and we'll have a strong lead as we go through fiscal 2023 and beyond. The most important thing, we're not really looking back at our competition. We're looking forward as we're talking about it, Jim and I've been talking about it. It's about the digital health solutions getting patients into the funnel and finding new ways to get the 1 billion people worldwide who have sleep suffocation into the funnel and 80% to 90% of them are undiagnosed. That's what we're laser focused on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon, everyone. Mick, one question from my side. And Mick, let me pose this as a hypothetical. Obviously, demand is not being met, right? Whether because of supply constraints or so forth, how do you ration between an organic ResMed patient that will be sticky long term versus, let's say, a Phillips patient that potentially could generate a higher ESP in short term? I guess, a subpart to that I'm also trying to understand, do you see mix and matches going out to the field, i.e., tubes and accessories with blowers being mixed and match just to meet demand? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Raj, it's a good question. And look, we don't – and particularly in the United States market, we work with home care providers and we're really taking the human patient first model here first which is we start with the highest acuity patients and work our way down. With our partnerships with home care providers, we start with existing relationships, digital adoption and because it drives best efficiency for the system and best outcomes for patients. So we don't make priorities. I will choose this patient because it will be more profitable this system because it'll be there. We focus on that acuity first, those relationships and the adoption of digital, because the long term is what we're focused on. We don't want some short term revenues and short term gains that you just give up. What you’re looking for transforming the health care system towards our 2025 goal. And so that's where our priorities are. Any further color, Jim, you'd like to provide on Raj’s question?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of things. I mean, first thing I’d said, we're not making the decision about the patients. It's the provider that's making the decision about the patients. But we're driving our production mix for higher acuity so that we can able providers to meet the needs of the higher acuity patients first. That’s the first thing I would say. Second thing, just as a reminder, I think we mentioned this. I think we mentioned it today, but we've certainly talked about this on previous calls. The way we're prioritizing product allocation is higher acuity patients, but we're also prioritizing, effectively prioritizing existing ResMed customer volumes, right? And that's a very explicit decision, right, because we could have said the alternative. We could have said we're going to take this opportunity to go take accounts that have favored Philips historically. But in fact, what we've done is we've done all of our allocations of product based upon the history we have with our customers. And the fact that that means is that its customers who are – have been more adopted of ResMed products who are getting more volume from us, right? And one of the opportunities for us as our volumes build, it’s actually once we’ve met the demand with those customers they actually take competitive share and in accounts that might have trended more towards Phillips historically. So that’s and we have some questions on growth next year, I think that’s a big opportunity for us for growth next year. And then the third thing on your question is it’s always been the case that providers will mix and match one manufacturer’s mask with one manufacturer’s device or whatever. There's a little bit more of a tie to the device and the tube if it's a heated tube because those are lock and key, you know, are heated to work with our devices and not with others. But we have higher share. We have a higher attach rate for all the consumables in the market than our competitors do. So when there's mixing and matching, it's almost always to our benefit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Polark from Baird. Your line is now live.
Michael Polark: Hey. Good day. Thanks for taking the question. It's a US-centric one. And I'm curious, you know, Inspire as second line CPA P therapy in the US. The company has been running a fairly active marketing campaign with TV commercials. In 2021, they spent $50 million. That number is going to be a lot higher in 2022. And I think a regional campaign is going national. Inspire second line. So, you know, it goes without saying on that. But their commercials tend not to portray CPAP therapy in the best light. And I'm curious what you think about this and if there's any counter detailing efforts you can do to respectfully push back on some of the marketing runs that that Inspire is doing?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks for your question, Michael. And it speaks to substitute therapies, which is something we look at very carefully because ResMed stands for respiratory medicine not CPAP manufacturer, right. And so we've been in alternative therapies for the sleep apnea therapy for decades. We have a dental 3-D printed dental device called Narval we’re the number one provider of dental sleep apnea therapy in Western Europe, Northern Europe and many other countries around the world. And we've invested in the technology in this space of the company you mentioned, Inspire. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is the category. We invested in a company called Nyxoah, N-Y-X-O-A-H, which is actually now listed on Nasdaq and on a European exchange, and they're in PMA trials here in the United States and an MDR work in Europe. And so that product will come to market in this segment. Look, yeah, we've seen some people do DTC advertising in this space. There was an oxygen delivery company that had a guy from Star Trek for a while. I think these things of demand gen in the old-school way is not the future for us. We're focused on social media. Our partnership with Google and Verily is around people typing in, my husband snores, I snore, and getting through a digital end-to-end pathway to identify, engage, and enroll people through. And we haven't really gone old-school media with demand gen, and we certainly don't need it in calendar 2022. To your point, you can't change – you can market however you want the industry, but you can't change clinical and economic realities. CPAP is the most economical and best noninvasive way to treat sleep apnea, period. Now, we make a sleep apnea device and a dental device, and we’re invested in hypoglossal nerve stim. I say that on the clinical and economic reality. Talk to any pulmonary person. Even an ENT surgeon will say, no, you have to try CPAP. You have to try dental, and then you'll try the hypoglossal nerve stim. ResMed is going to be involved in all three categories. I think they'll all be valid. But I think they should be known. He’s primary, he’s secondary, and he’s tertiary. And the economic reality is clear. You can Google the price. It's probably gone up a little on sleepapnea.com for a CPAP from those providers or EasyBreathe.com. They're probably $500 for the device, and trailing is, what, $100 on a mask every year. Compare that to a $25,000 surgery. I don't care what your high deductible health plan and health savings account is in the US. That's a lot of money for the individual and a boatload for the health system. So there'll be some economic realities of payers doing care management around this as it grows. Good category, long term. My opinion on the – that is any talk including the Wall Street Journal article this morning around 1 billion suffocating, 80%, 90% obviously that beyond diagnosed, any news about sleep apnea, sleep suffocation is good for ResMed and its demand gen. I preferred in 2023 than 2022 because we’ve got enough demand to keep us going for 12 months. We’ll be turning the knobs on our social media, our digital and our brick-and-mortar demand gen in 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Mike Matson: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for fitting me in. Just want to ask about the surcharge. I don't know if you're willing to disclose, you know, roughly what percentage that is. And is that something that's being applied to all of your products, in other words, the devices and mask and accessories or just specific to devices? And then, finally, is this something that's, you know, intended to be temporary or something that, you know, you expect to be more permanent? And I have a follow-up as well on something else.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Mike. Thanks. And we may not have time for your follow-up given we’re 15 minutes over already. But, look, the surcharge, uncomfortable, I think there was a sell-side note that was public at around this. We – it's a $12 surcharge in the US and a €12 surcharge in Europe. And it's basically on all devices. It's not applying on the mask side. So that's the answer to those. To the question of how long will this last, obviously, we're in discussions with customers around the world. If you look at Rob's answer to the question or if you're reading the transcript, further up that transcript, it's a complex issue around sea freight, air freight, component costs, semiconductor, microchips, and we don't know how long those freight costs will be high. Those component costs will be high. So I will say the surcharge will be there as long as those are there. It's temporary, but it's as long as those are there. And you know, I think you've got many other stocks in your portfolio where they're talking, they are the semiconductor manufacturer or the others who give you further detail on how long they think they will have supply chain constraints and therefore higher costs to pass-through their customers. So that's – that'd be the way I'd answer your two questions, Mike. Thank you for bringing those through and thank you to everyone for staying an extra 15 minutes. There's a lot to go on this quarter. Look, thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I’d once again, I'd like to take the opportunity for the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen in here for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better, live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks for surviving this COVIDness and the Zoom calls, and all the craziness. Thanks also to our frontline heroes who aren't on Zoom calls. They're doing patient care, technical care sales teams, visiting customers every day. I'd also like a special call out to the frontline supply chain team, management, procurement, distribution and our digital health teams working around the clock to keep up with every new launch of myAir, AirView, and Brightree, and MatrixCare. So thank you all. I look forward to talking to you all again in 90 days. Thank you. I'll hand you to Amy to close us out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And to echo Mick's comments, thank you everyone for sticking with us extra 15 minutes. That enabled us to get through everybody in the call to queue. We do appreciate your interest in your time, and if you have any follow-up questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. This does conclude our second quarter 2022 call. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you to close things out.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may just connect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-10-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ResMed First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. We ask that you please ask one question then return to the queue during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for ResMed. Please go ahead, Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. We thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today, along with a copy of the earnings press release and presentation, which are both available now. With me on the call today are ResMed's Chief Executive Officer, Mick Farrell; and Chief Financial Officer, Brett Sandercock. During the Q&A portion of our call, Mick and Brett will be joined by Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep & Respiratory Care business; and David Pendarvis, Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the September quarter, our first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our first quarter results demonstrate strong performance across our business, buoyed by extremely high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices as well as continuing recovery of many markets from COVID-19. We achieved double-digit growth at both the top and bottom line metrics of our business. I want to be clear that achieving these results has not been easy this quarter. We are dealing with an unprecedented what I would call perfect storm of elements, including the COVID recovery, but also including a competitor recall that's – a recall that's ten-fold higher than any in the industry to date, and supply chain constraints that are impacting not only our industry but multiple industries worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of ResMedians across our global teams, many of whom are working 24x7 to get our products and solutions into the hands of patients who need them most. Despite these extraordinary efforts, we know that we have not been able to meet all of the demand. As the market leader, our competitor, that is in the number two market share position, announced a recall mid-June that has created unprecedented dislocations in the market. In effect, we are facing the challenge of providing the volume for our own number one market share position and also trying to meet as much of their number two market share position as possible around the world. Given the supply chain crisis, our suppliers have been allocating components to us on the inbound side. We have, in turn, been forced to allocate our products on the outbound side to our customers. We have been clear on the guiding principles for that allocation of our products, namely that we are giving priority for production and delivery of our devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first. The allocation conversations that I have with our customers are the same ones that I am having with my suppliers and their suppliers and so on up the supply chain. As an example, during the quarter, I was on a Zoom call with one of our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, and I'm not kidding. We achieved our goal with that manufacturer. And we received increased allocation from that manufacturer. But then we face the challenge and are still facing it of working with the five customers of theirs, all the way down that chain to get to us to ensure that the agreed upon increased allocation of that component actually gets to ResMed, gets manufactured into ResMed products and then sent to ResMed customers and ultimately to patients. That's just one example of a high degree of difficulty dive for our supply chain team. The supply chain analysis and negotiations are ongoing, and the situation is very fluid, changing day by day, week by week and month by month. We have an incredible Six Sigma Black Belt laden team of supply chain specialists working on these issues 24/7. In short, supply bottlenecks continue to restrict our access to critical electronic components, especially semiconductor chips that ultimately limit our net production output. In addition to component supply issues, the ongoing challenges of seafreight and airfreight from manufacturing facilities to distribution warehouses and ultimately, the customers are increasing our costs and further impacting our ability to respond as rapidly as we want to the huge demand for ResMed products. The combination of component shortages and transportation bottlenecks makes providing steady and smooth flow of products to the market very difficult. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners, doing everything we can to gain access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. We will continue to coordinate with all stakeholders as the situation develops. We understand that this is a difficult situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and the most important customer, the patient. Our number one priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, for COPD, for asthma and for other chronic respiratory diseases as well as critical out-of-hospital care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need, where they need it and when they need it. Let's now discuss the overall market conditions in our industry. We are seeing a steady ongoing recovery of demand in the countries that we operate in. They remain at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of new patient flow. We are still seeing a divergence in total patient flow and sleep lab capacity from 75% to 95% of pre-COVID levels in some countries, up to 100% plus of pre-COVID levels in others. These metrics will continue to ebb and flow as vaccines and boosters roll out globally and as new variants of the coronavirus arise and cause temporary perturbations. Our global ResMed team remains committed to working with national, state and city governments as well as local health systems, hospitals and health care providers to supply the ventilators, the masks and the training for acute care and the transition home for affected patients. Let me now update you on our three strategic priorities as we pivot back to grow our core business. These three are one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. In August, we launched our next-generation device platform that we call AirSense 11 into the United States market. In short, that launch has been very successful. We will be introducing the AirSense 11 into additional countries very soon. Our market-leading R&D team accelerated the launch of this amazing innovation. First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers, and then accelerating to an earlier full product launch date to bring this product to market faster. Globally, we continue to sell our market-leading legacy platform, the AirSense 10, to maximize the total volume of CPAP, APAP and by levels available for customers. Clearly, the ongoing adoption of both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platforms remains very, very strong. It's still early into the SirSense 11 launch, but initial customer feedback, combined with the detailed responses to our controlled product launch, tells me that the AirSense 11 is another success for ResMed. Physician, provider and patient feedback are all very positive. I was able to attend the California Sleep Society meeting in person, actually, during the quarter, and I was able to observe firsthand the responses to the latest innovations on the AirSense 11, such as personal therapy assistant, care check-in and the incredible rate of uptake of the patient-centric app called myAir, which has been upgraded for AirSense 11. And the uptake on that is almost double what it was for the myAir app than the AirSense 10. What's clear to me is that this platform, the AirSense 11, benefits not only patients and their bed partners, in addition, the device and software combination benefits physicians, it benefits providers and it benefits payers as well as entire healthcare systems with more data, more insights and better outcomes. As a 2-way digital health comms platform with many technical features that represent significant therapeutic advances, AirSense 11 is not only easy to set up and use, it also offers a very rich patient-centric experience. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology that is able to increase patient adherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within healthcare providers and physicians own health systems. We are engaging with patients in their therapy digitally like never before in the industry. This is a critical part of the ResMed 2025 strategy, as presented at our Investor Day, which we held virtually during this last quarter. Another key aspect of our long-term growth is linked to the awareness and the increasing flow of sleep apnea patients. With 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, this work is critical to our mission. COVID-19 has advanced awareness, adoption and acceptance of digital health and remote care, including home-based sleep apnea tests. We want to support seamless and cost-effective approaches to sleep diagnostics. We want to scale technology that in our consumer markets enables an easy-to-use device experience and technology that, in our reimbursed markets, can be a low-cost, clinically reliable, screening tool for sleep apnea. In this vein, on October 1, we closed a transaction to acquire EctoSense, a leader in cloud connected home sleep apnea testing technology from Belgium. We believe EctoSense's digital and easy-to-use solutions in the hands of both physicians and sleep lab technicians, as well as consumers can help significantly increase sleep apnea diagnosis rates, as well as general sleep awareness. EctoSense will operate within our sleep and respiratory care business unit, and we're excited to bring this innovative technology to more global markets as we move forward. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our long-term goal is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. Demand for our core noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD and beyond was strong throughout the quarter, especially in markets outside the United States where physicians and providers shifted focus to support the most severe highest acuity patients. This demand is aligned with our strategy to ensure priority for manufacturing and delivery of the devices that meets the needs of those patients, specifically those that need life support ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, including by level support, first. We are balancing the growth in the respiratory care demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the coronavirus pandemic as well as customers as they balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe a little over a year ago, and we continue to expand this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been very helpful to physicians not only during COVID, but it is increasingly valuable on an ongoing basis for them and the health care systems that they operate in. In the not-too-distant future, I can see AirView becoming standard of care for patients on home-based ventilation protocols in many health care systems. Let me now review our Software as a Service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment as well as facility-based and home-based care settings. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our home medical equipment and our home health products, and we continue to grow with customers as they utilize our software and data solutions, including Brightree and Snap ReSupply to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates of patients improve across SNFs and other facility-based care settings. We will continue to watch this closely as COVID cases ebb and flow at slower and slower rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for technology investments in these SaaS verticals, which provides opportunities for us to increase our new customer pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease. As we look at our portfolio of software solutions, we expect SaaS revenue to accelerate, increasing from mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share. We are the leading strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care, and we provide mission-critical software across a broad set of very attractive markets. We are uniquely positioned, and we have created differentiated value for ResMed with our SaaS portfolio. We are set up for sustainable growth through ongoing innovation investments, commercial excellence partnerships and future acceleration through strategic M&A as well as selective tuck-in M&A opportunities. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's business across sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our patient-centric, physician-centric and provider-centric approach, combined with our unique ResMed culture, means that we are well positioned to continue winning in the vastly underserved respiratory medical markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We are transforming out-of-hospital care at scale. We are leading the market in digital health technology. With over 10 billion nights now, 10 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 15.5 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide, we are unlocking value from these data to help patients, providers, physicians, payers and entire health care systems. Our mission and goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025, drives and motivates me and ResMedians every day. We again made excellent progress toward that goal this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these ongoing and unprecedented times. You, our ResMed team, have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with COVID-19, with those emergency needs these last 18 months. And you are now and you have now already pivoted back to provide ongoing support for all of our customers during some of the most challenging industry dynamics that we've seen in the industry. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open the call up for Q&A. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $904 million, an increase of 20%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 19%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels experienced in the prior year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. In the September quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand was approximately $4 million compared to $40 million estimated incremental revenue from COVID-19-related demand in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the September 2021 and September 2020 quarters, our global revenue increased by 25% on a constant currency basis. Looking forward, we expect negligible revenue from COVID-19-related demand. In relation to the impact of our competitors' recall, we estimate that we generated incremental device revenue in the range of $80 million to $90 million in the September quarter. Taking a look at our geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $491 million, an increase of 22%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $315 million, an increase of 23% and or an increase of 21% in constant currency terms. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $276 million, an increase of 40%. Masks and other sales were $215 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $218 million, an increase of 24% or in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $97 million, an increase of 21% or in constant currency terms, an 18% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 31%, while masks and other sales increased by 8%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 44% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 10% in constant currency terms. Software as a Service revenue for the September quarter was $98 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. For the balance of fiscal year 2022, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the ongoing launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform into additional markets and geographies and share gains during our competitors' recall. However, as reported last quarter, while we are working hard to increase manufacturing output, we will not be able to meet the expected demand resulting from our competitors' recall, primarily because of significant and ongoing supply constraints for electronic components. As Mick discussed earlier, we're operating in a very dynamic supply chain environment. Based on the latest information available, we continue to expect component supply constraints will limit the incremental device revenue resulting from our competitors' recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million for fiscal year 2022. This includes the device revenue we were able to generate in Q1. In particular, we now do not see any improvement in our component supply position until our fourth quarter of FY 2022. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 270 basis points to 57.2% in the September quarter compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to higher manufacturing and freight costs, ASP declines and unfavorable currency movements, which has been partially offset by a positive product mix, particularly in relation to strong growth of our higher acuity devices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $177 million, an increase of 11% or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10% compared to the prior year period. The increase was predominantly attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 19.5% compared to the 21.1% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. R&D expenses for the quarter were $60 million, an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solutions development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2022. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $281 million, an increase of 18%, underpinned by strong revenue growth. During the quarter, we finalized the deed of settlement with the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, covering transit pricing audits for the years 2009 through 2018, and also agreed on transfer pricing principles for the future. In anticipation of this settlement, we had previously estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $249 million, net of credits and deductions in our FY 2021 financial results. In relation to the conclusion of the settlement in the current quarter, we recorded an additional GAAP tax expense of $4 million associated with lower tax credits, which were driven by foreign currency movements. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 21.3%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Looking forward, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $222 million, an increase of 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.51, an increase of 19%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $204 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.39. We had negative cash flow from operations for the quarter of $66 million due to the payment of $285 million to the Australian Taxation Office associated with the deed of settlement. After adjusting for this payment, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter September totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $61.2 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.4 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to report equity losses of approximately $2 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2022 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $276 million. At September 30, we had $806 million gross debt and $530 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had almost $1.5 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our operating performance. Our solid cash flow and low leverage provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as [indiscernible] Health and EctoSense, an acquisition we made on October 1. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thanks, Mick. Kevin, I'd like to now turn the call back over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now be conducting your question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now live.
Matthew Mishan: Good afternoon and I hope everyone is doing well. Mick, the first question is how do you ensure that your devices are going to new patient fits versus a replacement device for Phillips?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Matthew. Well, it's easy in markets where we're fully vertically integrated, like Germany, South Korea, and other markets worldwide Australia, New Zealand and others and we're able to work directly with those patients and the doctors to make that happen. It is more difficult in other markets like France or the US where we've worked through providers. But it's been pretty clear from our competitor there that they want people to go and register the devices, and they're going to focus, they said 12 months on just replacing those devices. And frankly, that's theoretical and legal duty to go do that. And so they are laser-focused on that. And so our work is to make sure -- we see the demand from patients directly in those vertically integrated markets and through distributors. And we're pretty confident that the vast, vast, vast majority of our devices go to new patients. There may be some going to replacement patients who are going online or going through certain aspects to get around and go faster than the Philips process, but certainly, the vast majority are going to new patients. The challenge for us is that the demand of being the number one player and also covering as much of the demand of the number two players as possible. We've reached the capacity of those critical components coming in the front end. And so we're not even able to meet all of that new patient demand with -- due to those supply chain constraints.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Chris Cooper: Thanks for taking my question. Look, Mick, I know when you set the guidance of $300 million to $350 million for the recall, you were sort of unable to quantify masks and reluctant to do so. I was just hoping for an update today on whether you are seeing, in fact, any associated benefit on your mask sales due to the significant increase in CPAP that you've seen in the quarter?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's a great question. And as you know, we don't provide detailed guidance and we sort of went further than we ever did because of the wide variety of sell-side estimates of what the incremental revenue could be. And we gave that last quarter. We gave that $300 million to $350 million device rough guidance, right? It's not perfect because we're predicting 12 months out in a very uncertain environment. And as Brett just reiterated, we're sticking with that, knowing that we actually had $80 million to $90 million during this quarter that comes out of that, right, and then we've got the remainder to go fight for those components and be able to deliver that over the next nine months. In the mask side, it's a very complicated story, and there's a number of moving factors, and we can get into this, and I can handle Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Sleep & Respiratory Care, can give further detail on this question or if there's a follow-up question on it. But what I can say on mask is we're not going to give public guidance around it, but there's a number of moving factors. You saw our mask growth during the quarter, it was globally at 8%, and the US market was around 5%. The headwinds we have is that, while our number two competitor is not serving as many new patients as they should, and we're not able to take all that demand, there are less new patients being set up. And ResMed -- no matter what the device was, ResMed had a very good, well above 50% uptake rate of those new masks on new devices, no matter who was the manufacturer. And so that's a headwind for our business if there's a new patient that's not getting any therapy. And then the tailwinds would be, which are not as high in volume, but the tailwinds would be that when it is a ResMed device, there is a higher probability because they're designed to work together, and they are working better together and a doctor who loves our devices often likes our masks and same with the sleep technician and the sleep therapist and a respiratory therapist, they often like the brands across the technology spectrum and ResMed's the leader in that we do get a very good uptake on that. So there's some upgrade on the adherence rate to a ResMed device, but there's a headwind of -- even with a competitor device, if there's no device out there, there is less mask sales happening. And thus, you have the sort of 5% growth in the US masks, while we're limited on the ability as an industry to take care of that upfront demand. I think that's about as much color as I can go into it without quantifying it for you. But I can tell you, it's a complex moving equation for us to model at a customer basis and a country level, so I can understand the difficulty for folks on the sell side as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Low from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
David Low: Thanks. Mick, if I could just get you to touch on the guidance, the $300 million to $350 million. I mean, given we've seen $80 million to $90 million come through this quarter. Could we just talk a little bit about how you expect this to be phased through the rest of the year, given the supply side constraints, please?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. And as I said in the prep remarks, there's a perfect storm hitting the industry. And so there's so many dynamics impacting us that I'm going to call this afternoon working on this. I'm shifting my attention, which usually focuses purely on customers and governments and making sure the demand is there for this is an amazing industry that we serve and sleep apnea and asthma, and I'm spending a lot more time with suppliers. So with that, our best reading of the future flow of components is that, you look at it, and as Brett said in the prepared remarks, that we actually had reasonably good flow, some through inventory and working through that in the quarter of $80 million to $90 million here in the first quarter. It's going to be very difficult here in the December quarter with component shortages and very difficult in the March quarter with component shortages. I do think the components, as we are getting some increased signals and actually doing some great engineering to work around different suppliers and to design in new components. I feel much more confident about the June quarter 2022, so our Q4 fiscal year 2022. And so that's sort of qualitative guidance to it. We're not modeling it out. We've got the $300 million to $350 million. You can subtract off the $80 million to $90 million and model it. But if I was looking at it, it would be tougher in December and tougher in March right now and then freeing up in the June quarter and then September quarter, even more so as some of our new designs and new components get to roll in and we get that flow going. But look, it's changing day by day, week by week. I'm looking forward to my call this afternoon to potentially impact that. But even if I get agreement with someone today, it takes quite a while, as I explained sort of with that example of the five levels deep in the supply chain to get that to flow through from a foundry, to a chip manufacturer, to our factory, to a product, to the warehouse to then be able to sell it to a customer. So I know that's not a specific quantitative guidance, David. It's probably the best I can give you in terms of color for fiscal year 2022. And the hope we have in Q4 and Q1 2023, as we start to see those components really start to free up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.
Suraj Kalia: Hi, Mick. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Hey Mick, specifically, on the Philips recall, if I could, could you walks us through the dynamics in the U.S. versus OUS? How sticky are these share gains? And unless our math is wrong, it almost comes across like there is some sort of mix and match on the masks versus the devices. Just give us some additional color. And really what we are trying to understand is, okay, you get $350 million, $400 million, whatever million incremental, how sticky are these? And how do you all plan for this? Thank you for taking my questions.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Suraj. And since I've answered the first three, I'll just correct that our guidance was $300 million to $350 million, not $350 million to $400 million, what you just said, but $300 million to $350 million 0 for the fiscal year. But Jim Hollingshead, you run this business. Do you want to do you give as much as you can on the color to Suraj?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Suraj, for the question. I think it's a very good question. And I'm just going to back up to what we're trying to do in the business, independent of the recall and then talk about the context of the recall. With the launch of AirSense 11, our aim is to put in place a product that once again significantly improves the patient experience and significantly improves workflows and lower costs for providers and also puts us in the position midterm, long-term to improve outcomes. So AirSense 11 is a device that we put on market anticipating long-term share gain. And we have internal goals for that number. And we don't talk about that number publicly, but our plan was to take share with that device. We're launching that device now into a situation where the number two player in the market is out of the market for new patients. And so obviously, we're going to take quite a lot of share, as we can put that product into the market. And we have the two best products on the market in AirSense 10 and AirSense11. So your question is how sticky will that share be? Our goal is to make it quite sticky. But obviously, we have good competitors in this market, and we don't anticipate landing at 100% share, when they recall clears, but we want to have a number that's higher than what it was before we launched AirSense 11, and we're pretty confident we can do that. And just to cap on that, the answer is probably already too long, but to cap on that, I will say that we've managed to take a few points of mass share during the recall as well, and our aim would be to keep some of that share as well. So I think we will emerge from this stronger, than when we entered it. And our offerings are clearly the best offerings on the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gretel Janu from Crédit Suisse. Your line is now live.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just on U.S. mask, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on that, given that it did disappoint slightly versus expectations. So has there been any change to the ReSupply dynamics in the U.S. market in the quarter?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. I'll have a go and maybe Jim can join in as well. But I get the ReSupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree ReSupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible ReSupply. If you remember, that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago, even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago, our mask ReSupply and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it, our mask ReSupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps, we're still achieving some very good rates in ReSupply. As I said, there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks, some new patients, no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of ReSupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market, look at Europe, Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in, you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8%, which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups. But Jim, any further color on the U.S. or beyond?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah. I would just say, probably end up repeating some of the key points, but we had a very large comp. And there was a tailwind created by COVID, which is patients, we've talked about this before over the last three or four quarters, but patients are more focused on having clean masks. I mean COVID has created a mentality, if I want a new mask; I want a fresh mask for patients. And then our HME customers in the U.S. have been focused on driving resupply into their installed base of patients. And I actually think that within the context of the Philips recall, driving revenue out of the installed base of patients has once again become quite an important emphasis for our HME customers. And then there are the headwinds. The headwinds of the whole market is not being served, so new patient starts are down. And because we had slower new patient starts during the span of COVID overall, because labs weren't open, there's a little bit of headwind on resupply, because the installed base didn't grow during that period the way we might have anticipated it to. So it balances out. The dynamic inside of the installed base is quite good. So the installed base of patients continue to be resupplied at a very healthy rate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Wong-Pan from RBC. Your line is now live.
Craig Wong-Pan: Thanks. Just the question for me was on the different regions, which are trending below pre-COVID levels and which ones are above. Could you just give any color which different markets are and in which category? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Craig. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Rob Douglas: Yes. Thanks, Craig. The issue really is that all of our markets are performing very strongly. The actual recall impacts it global. So we're seeing that really excess demand. And just with different dynamics, as Mick said before, you saw that very strong in the mask on all of it. I actually couldn't call out any particular region and saying it wasn't doing really well. There are specific countries, and sometimes it's local when there's a lockdown, there might be a shortage of diagnosis capacity, and you'll see that. But our teams really run through that and manage around that. And as I said, just to recap, the strong performance was across all countries.
Mick Farrell: Yes. And I'll add on maybe just a little bit of color there, Craig. I mean it's hard to say, because you said, what regions, and as Rob said, we can't say what regions. And even if you would ask a more specific question, what countries. It'd be difficult to say there, because in the U.S., there are 50 states with all different regulations, and some of them are 100% plus capacity and some are at 75%, 80% within the state level. And then cities going up and down, and China is not just there. It's different regions there as well. So there are ebbs and flows on a daily, weekly, monthly. But what we can say is on aggregate, it is getting better and better. And it's nice to see some cities, some states, some countries at 100% plus that they're getting through it, they're finding ways to embrace digital health, home sleep apnea testing and remote setup, so that we're able to get the flow of patients going through. Then the challenge we have right now is that we don't have the components of those patients with prescriptions come through to meet all that demand, which is the real critical rate limited right now as well. Thanks for your question, Craig.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is now live.
David Bailey: Thanks very much. Good morning, Mick and Brett. Just as part of the recall, ResMed is going to be getting more exposure through the patient referral network. I'm just wondering if you've had any feedback or observations from physician, DMEs, patients in relation to RedMed's product offering. Just wondering if there's any observations from that group that may have used ResMed less frequently before.
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, it's a good question. I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader, everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it, and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said, there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. And to your question, they are getting, if you like, forced exposure, because it's the only one available for new patients, to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device, the software, the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand, they're now trying a new brand. And I do think, to Jim's point earlier, that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says, wow, this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong. And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly, the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean, the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising, and the knowledge about the brands, for better or for worse, through this awful recall is, they're getting to know what device they have. And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry, because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial, clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean, the short answer to your question is, yes, we've got exposure to new consumers, new physicians, new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents three less clicks to get a report, when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system, really efficiently, it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now live.
Maggie Boeye: This is Maggie Boeye on for Margaret. I wanted to ask one on gross margins today. I would say that the gross margins for the quarter came in a little bit better than expected, although still contracting. Can you talk about some of the dynamics within that and how you are leveraging the increase in cost given the supply constraints and the freight issues today? And how you are looking at future gross margins specifically in the upcoming quarters? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Brett, I'll hand that question to you.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Maggie. Yes, the gross margin is pretty consistent with where we were at Q4. And the big impact we're still seeing is on freight costs, that's been really significant. So we've been -- that's a big headwind for us. So that's in it, some FX impacts. I think we've had a deal with which is heading this quarter as well. We were -- we did have a little bit of benefit on product mix with the higher acuity devices. So I think of the level Astral sellers, ASV devices they helped the total product mix this quarter, which helps on the gross margin side. So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us. But having said all that, there's still challenges, still pressures on freight still pressures that will come through on component costs and so on as well. So we need to keep an eye on that, but product mix has been quite good for us and that's helped. Yes. So overall, pretty pleased with how the gross margin ended up for the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Sean Laaman: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning team. Great set of numbers. Mick, I know you typically don't give sort of much discussion around what you've observed on price in the quarter or on product mix. But that said, you've talked to the supply constraints, yet you've delivered the device numbers that you have. How would you -- or could you help us characterize what you've observed on the price/volume mix somehow in the quarter? Thanks, Mick.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sean. And you're right, we don't provide details around pricing. But look, clearly, this is -- these are unprecedented times, costs. As you saw, and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs, I mean, sea freight, there are over 100 ships just two hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. Air freight, we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes, but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead, and so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11, we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for eight years, it's the best in the market, I think, ever, as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium, and so we will be extracting that. And look, we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look, this is a customer-by-customer, region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly, we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us, and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Frank on for Anthony. Two questions from our side. Number one, what's the reception to Philips' recent US clearance of the replacement the abatement among US DMEs? And then a follow-up. We're hearing a lot on US hospital staffing shortages. Is there a potential tailwind for Matrix Care, or what are some of the dynamics there looking ahead for the rest of the year?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions, Frank. Look, I actually have no idea what customers are thinking of the replacement phone versus the replacement devices for our competitor. That's their job to take care of that. If I was a patient, I'd want to replace a device. I wouldn't want to replaced phone. That's what I'd say. But I have no idea on that. It's a very, very lack of strong communication that I've seen publicly on that. And I can tell you, as N equals one, I have nothing to add to that. But on the US hospital front, I do think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up the numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think -- as you said, that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that. But Rob, do you have any further color on MatrixCare and the Brightree home health and hospice?
Rob Douglas: Absolutely. It's actually an underpinning of our SaaS strategy that it's been a long-term issue that getting the right staff and keeping them and dealing with the cost of training them and getting staff who are providing really good patient experience has been a big challenge for all of these care providers, not just hospitals. And so we believe that our technology solutions actually make life better for the staff, make it easier for them to do the job, easier to get trained, and more likely to stay on the job and also more efficient. So, staffing challenges actually are another driver of our strategy, just like as Jim mentioned earlier, the concerns about cleanliness and respiratory health are a driver of our core sleep strategy, these staffing shortages and challenges do drive our SaaS strategy long-term. And long-term, that will be a tailwind for the business. Many, many short-term factors going on there. But we've -- as Mick said earlier, we're seeing good improved performance despite challenging times, particularly for skilled busing facilities across our SaaS businesses.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Wheen from Jarden. Your line is now live.
Steve Wheen: Thanks. Good afternoon Mick. I just wanted to ask, I imagine it's quite difficult to differentiate what sales of devices are relating or going into the Philips opportunity versus the organic growth of your business. But if I do strip out the $90 million out of your device revenues for this quarter and then strip out the $40 million of vent sales in the PCP, you're getting in excess of 20% growth. Is that how you characterize what's going on with the new patient starts?
Mick Farrell: Steve, thanks for the question. And yes, good morning to you there in Australia. I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in eight years. And as I said in my prep remarks, I mean, I'm blown away by things like the personal care system, watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams, but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device, I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall, irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. And as Jim said earlier, our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to Mya and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed through this. So, Steve, thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is now live.
John Deakin-Bell: Thank you. I was just hoping to get a little more color on where you think the sleep testing capacity is in the market. Are we back to pre-pandemic levels? So just give us a little more color on new patients and where you think that is kind of trended over the last couple of quarters.
Mick Farrell: Great question, John. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead.
Jim Hollingshead: Thanks, John. As we said in Mick's prepared remarks, testing capacity is mostly back to normal. I would say, in the US market, we're mostly back to normal, and there's actually probably some upside into that because a number of sleep labs increasingly during the COVID crisis, home sleep testing was more readily adopted by sleep labs and maybe would not have taken it on before. And so probably -- you still probably got slightly fewer people going to labs but a much broader use of home sleep testing. And I think in general, you can say in the US, testing capacity is back to normal, maybe a little bit up, although the shape of it looks a little bit different. And then other reasons, it's really -- it varies quite a lot by what's happened with the Delta variant, what's happened with health care systems. But in general, I would say new patient starts in, say, Europe, are coming back to pre-COVID normal. Some countries are a little bit different. And in some cases, you've still got health systems that are a little bit backed up, right? So especially in hospital-based systems the diagnosis may be back up, but the actual capacity to set patients up on therapy may be now a bit of the bottleneck. So there's pent-up demand and things like that. But I would say, in general, we're almost back to normal. And I would add to that, one of the reasons we decided to move forward with the acquisition of Ectosense is that we really want to make it much easier for patients to understand whether or not they have a sleeping issue. So in some markets Ectosense will be used as a screener. And in some markets, Ectosense is already used as a diagnostic tool. But the patient experience with that technology is really, really simple, really easy to do. And so we're working with that acquisition to open up the funnel even further.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about inventory levels a little bit, both at ResMed and also at the distributors. So in your balance sheet, I see higher inventory levels compared to last quarter. Can you talk about what that might mean for device sales going into second quarter? But then also, if we look at the different regions you're operating in, from our perspective, we're seeing greater bottlenecks at set up in the United States than in Europe. So do you have a sense of what inventory levels are like with your distributors between the United States and Europe?
Mick Farrell: So that's a great question, Lyanne, and quite detailed. I'll hand the first part of the question about ResMed's inventory and what's been happening with the build up there to, Brett. And then I'll hand the second part about the inventory at the HMEs, HCPs and distributors, as they call them in Europe, between the US and Europe to Jim Hollingshead. So Brett, over to you first, and then Jim
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Hi, Lyanne. Yes, on the inventory that -- a lot of that field reflects the components of raw materials part of our inventory. And we're really -- it's really in response, I think, to the elongation of supply chains and the bottlenecks and congestions that we're seeing. We are looking to support production for any upside in electronic components. So it says there's a lot of components that are ready to go once we get electronic components. So we've been pretty deliberate on that. We're looking to increase safety stocks as well, really just trying to deal with these supply disruptions. And the other big one we're seeing is that just with the increased sea freight, air freight, lead times, it's sort of blowing out to two, up to four weeks. So that's kind of more inventory that we're carrying, and I think probably a lot of companies will see that as well. So those logistics delays, I think, are causing a lot more, what I call, stock in transit coming through as well. So it's a combination of those factors. We're also running, for example, the dual AS 10, AS 11 platforms, and that's really there to support demand into the market. So we're doing that as well, which might be a little more unusual than what we would typically do. So the combination of those factors is really driving up our inventory levels a little bit low. Inventory days have been reasonable. So that's really trying to support overall production when we get those components in, I think, is the crux and the thesis there.
Operator: Our next question today is coming...
Mick Farrell: Hold on. Sorry, Jim is going to answer the second part of that.
Jim Hollingshead: I'll just add to Lyanne's -- no, that's fine. I'll just add to second half of Lyanne's question, which is, I think it's very safe to say that our customers and distributors have very little inventory. They are running right now, I think, with unusually low inventory levels. And so when you take the number two manufacturer out of the market and you under serve the market, it creates a very, very difficult situation. So we're reporting what we think is obviously a strong quarter, but we are working frantically to lift our manufacturing supply and deliver product to market. And as an industry, the manufacturers in this industry are under-serving demand. And so it's put our customers in a very difficult situation, and they're frustrated and we understand that they're frustrated. And we're doing the very best we can to build products as fast as we can and deliver it as fast as we can because we know that the market is undersupplied, and it's putting our customers under a great deal of pressure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saul Hadassin from Barrenjoey. Your line is now live.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks very much, guys. Apologies, if the line a bit crackly. But Mick, just a quick question on SaaS, you mentioned growth increasing to the upper single digit by the end of fiscal 2020. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that increase are what the key drivers of that uplift are likely to be give you that confidence?
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and hand to Rob maybe for some further details. Look, we have Bobby Ghoshal, our new President of the SaaS division. And I can tell you, he's hitting the ground running these last five weeks. He's been in there. And certainly, we're seeing some great opportunities for accelerating growth. I think, look, the externalities that I talked about in the prep remarks that we covered earlier, that skilled nursing facility census is coming back, so demand is coming back. And we see the book, the pipeline book starting to build up. And in a SaaS business, that's great because when the pipeline builds up, you get the conversions and then it turns into revenue. So we get pretty good visibility, even three, six, nine months out to seeing sort of an acceleration of growth. So I feel pretty confident that those census rates and others that census rates are going up and that we are going to see with MatrixCare is really good products, growth in the MatrixCare business to start accelerating there. In addition, Brightree and Snap, although they're annualizing some of the acquisitions of Snap, we're seeing really good adoption of those resupply and some really new innovative tools that the Brightree R&D team are bringing to market. And Bobby was previously COO there and has a good knowledge of that. I think that will accelerate throughout the rest of the fiscal year. But Rob, there's so many -- the eight verticals there. What other elements do you have reasons to believe they can accelerate this business?
Rob Douglas: I think you've covered many of them, Mick, but also there's a real execution focus on the team, and we're really confident that they're driving execution. Mick mentioned the innovation. There's a strong innovation mentality in that team. And we've got great new offerings and great new ideas coming to market as well as really streamlining our focus. And a lot of it's also execution on the sales front and having the sales team being able to build the pipelines and then increasingly doing face-to-face visits in getting these deployments underway as things ease up. So we've got a lot of confidence in that business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dan Hurren from MST Marquee. Your line is now live.
Dan Hurren: Good morning. Thanks very much. Just looking at the fourth quarter, you guided to this $300 million to $350 million. And at that time, you were quite explicit that we should not expect the uplift until the second half. And now today, you're suggesting uplift comes in first quarter and fourth quarter, and you delivered almost what, 30% of that total up 54% in the first quarter alone. So – and on top of that, Brett, has just said you've got the small material inventory build. So can you explain what has – what's changed since then? And why – what mechanics of this drop off in second, third quarter would be? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So look, it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that, I know the names and the people and them talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. And obviously, everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this, we're not alone in medical device industry, automotive industry, consumer communications industry, even consumer products are often cloud connected now and have these limitations. So look, things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. And our visibility, as I look at the June quarter, I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March, it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics, even though we feel in aggregate, that $300 million and $350 million, which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it, that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through, whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now, and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. But look, things can change on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability, if you like, of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though, we get one more chip, it goes into one more device and goes to one patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plan in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in, that rate-limiting bottleneck part, it goes on to a product, gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Farrell for any further closing comments.
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks, Kevin, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for staying on an extra five to seven minutes here and joining us on this call. I'd also like to thank once again the 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders who listen to this call for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this crisis, patient care, technical service, sales teams working with customers every day, but I'd like to add a special call out to our amazing teams on the front lines of supply chain, management production, distribution, all of you are heroes. Every chip you get is a patient's life change. So, I look forward to talking with you all again all of our stakeholders here in 90 days. Thank you. I'll turn the call back to Amy to close out.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our first quarter 2022 call. Kevin, you may now close this out.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-08-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Rob, and hi, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. As Rob said, this call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with a copy of the earnings release and presentation. On the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will join us during the Q&A session. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or the appendix of the earnings presentation. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review ResMed's SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. Before I turn the call over to Mick, I would like to highlight ResMed's upcoming Virtual Investor Day on September 8, which we announced in our earnings press release today. More details and information including an agenda and how to register will be available on our Investor Relations website approximately 2 weeks before the event. Okay, Mick, over to you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of our June quarter, the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our financial results as well as review progress towards ResMed's 2025 strategic goals. I will discuss execution highlights against our top three strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last month and half. During the quarter, demand for ResMed's Sleep and Respiratory Care devices surged dramatically after our competitors recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. Global supply chain limitations including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. Executive teams across automotive, consumer product and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic components shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real world supply chain capacity constraints. In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops, and we begin to open up the supply constraints. We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers, and most importantly the ultimate customer, the patient. It is a unique time in our industry, with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries. With these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall, all occurring simultaneously. I want to be clear that through it all our priority will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. Let me be very clear about a couple of things. One, ResMed sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. They are the best in the market. They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. And Positive Airway Pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just 7 weeks ago. They were the number two player to our number one leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. We're doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the past, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain constrained environment throughout fiscal year 2022. This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14. So we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team both internal and external. And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply constrained. We do see room for expansion of supply ahead. We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022 over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share, as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. Our experience over the last 7 plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country-by-country. But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country. And at the same time new variants including the Delta variant continue to cause disruption in some geographies. Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and health care providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140 plus countries that we operate in. A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in health care treatment outside the hospital, and particularly in the home. These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter, and with some tailwinds from our competitors recall right at the end of the quarter. While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue, and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit and all the while fighting for recovery patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians helping people in 140 countries. We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal year 2022. We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our health care delivery partners. During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research. All the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. We are reinvesting for long-term growth. We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted, we have to earn it every day with every product, every solution, and every service and every customer interaction. Customers vote with their wallets. And right now they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value. With an industry leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. This app is now cloud native and serverless in the cloud. This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture, and with support for full cycle teams. And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out of hospital care. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers, as well as for private and government payers and the community -- communities that they serve. Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. Last quarter, we previewed our next gen platform called AirSense 11. Responding to the current industry situation, our market leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. First, by expanding the control product launch to additional customers just this last month. And second by moving to an earlier full product launch date. We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter, and then to other countries gradually over time. This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. Previously we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. We are in a unique situation today. Our market leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at Skype, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, IPAP and bilevel volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. The bottom line is that we're going to be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time, as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year. And as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market, and I am understating the results when I say that the response to our control product launch has been very positive. AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall health care systems. As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. But they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and inherence to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers own health care systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our Respiratory Care Solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions, and high flow therapy offerings. We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mass solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID, on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. They were not material to our overall results, they were under $20 million in sales, just under. As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and health care systems and the patients they serve in their acute need. But we do not expect the resulting revenue from COVID to be material to our global business. Of course, the broader humanitarian impact is measurable with preservation of life through our ventilation solutions, a top priority in all of these countries. Our supply chain focus is for Astral, our life support ventilator, then Stellar, our non-invasive ventilator, and then our Lumis and AirCurve platforms to ensure that we can help patients who need our support the most. Demand for our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for COPD are experiencing the same steady recovery and new patient flow as we see in our sleep apnea business. We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe this time a year-ago. We are now expanding this technology to regions around the world. The value being provided through AirView for ventilation has been helpful to physicians not only during the COVID crisis, but it is also increasingly valuable as an ongoing clinical tool for them and for the health care systems that they operate in. In summary, we are helping to ensure that digital health is the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our Software-as-a-Service business for out of hospital health care. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in mid single digits year-over-year across our portfolio of markets, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, and life plan communities. The continued growth of home-based care is providing tailwinds for our HME and home health products. And we continue to grow with customers as they utilize and optimize our resupply solutions to improve patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for some verticals in our SaaS business, particularly skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. However, we are seeing positive trends as census rates improve across SNFs, and other care settings. We are watching this very closely as COVID peaks in the case of varying rates around the country. We expect there to be pent-up demand for our software purchasing that provides opportunities for us to increase our pipeline as COVID restrictions continue to ease state-by-state. Our leading position as the software provider of choice to the HME market enabled us to help customers manage through the pandemic and to maintain a healthy business. Our Brightree branded software solutions are allowing HMEs to work through current challenges within our industry, including the need for increased patient support, the need for management of product shortages in some categories, as well as ongoing growth in the resupply of much needed home medical equipment. As we look across our portfolio of solutions, we expect our SaaS revenue growth to gradually accelerate increasing from its current mid single-digit growth to high single-digit growth by the back end of this fiscal year. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these market growth rates as we continue to innovate and take market share from competitors. Additionally, we see opportunities on our radar screen to drive growth through further SaaS acquisitions to augment our existing organic growth. We have a good history of thorough due diligence, ensuring that ResMed is the best owner of the asset. And of course, that we can bring additional value for our customers with the new offering, and of course additional value for all of our shareholders. In summary, our SaaS offerings are well received in each of the verticals that we serve. And we see an increasing opportunity to leverage analytics to minimize acute care episodes for residents, patients and clients in our provider network. And ultimately, to allow people to age in place, away from a hospital and preferably in their own homes. Looking at the portfolio of ResMed's businesses across both sleep and respiratory care as well as our SaaS solutions, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative products and solutions. Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day. The light shining on the importance of respiratory health and hygiene is brighter than it ever was due to this pandemic. COVID has also highlighted the importance of digital health, it's accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening, diagnosis set up as well as patient monitoring and management. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D to ensure ResMed solutions remain market leading and provide a catalyst for long-term growth. With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances. You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID. And now you have rapidly pivoted the company back to provide ongoing support for our customers and patients during very challenging industry dynamics and supply chain constraints with unprecedented demand. Thank you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we will go to Q&A with the whole team. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $876 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was in turn driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19 impacted reduced levels in the prior year quarter, and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors. The increased year-over-year demand for our sleep solutions during Q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in COVID-19 related demand for our ventilators and related accessories. In the June quarter, we estimate the incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand primarily in India was approximately $20 million, a decline of $105 million compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant currency basis. Going forward, we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 related demand. Note, as a reminder, in Q1 FY '21, we had COVID-19 related incremental revenue of approximately $40 million. As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which in turn has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices. We estimate that we generate an incremental device revenue of approximately $60 million to $70 million in the June quarter due to our competitors recall. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution, excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $472 million, an increase of 18%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $308 million, an increase of 11%, or an increase of 2% in constant currency terms. By product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $268 million, an increase of 30%. Masks and other sales were $204 million, an increase of 5%. In Europe, Asia and other markets device sales totaled $210 million, an increase of 2% or in constant currency terms, a decrease of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $98 million, an increase of 36% or in constant currency terms a 24% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 12%, while masks and other sales increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in both the current quarter and the prior year quarter, global device sales increased by 46% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 16% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Looking forward to fiscal year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors recall. However, while we are working hard to increase capacity, we will not be able to meet all the expected demand resulting from our products -- compared from our competitors recall, primarily because of supply constraints for electronic components. And we expect these constraints to be more limiting in the first half of FY '22 than the second half. As Mick mentioned, we believe component supply constraints as they stand will currently limit incremental device revenue attributable to our competitors recall to somewhere between $300 million and $350 million during fiscal year '22. During my remaining commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 260 basis points to 57.3% in the June quarter, compared to 59.9% in the same quarter last year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to a negative product mix impact, specifically a proportional increase in sales of our lower margin sleep devices, ISP [ph] declines and unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also continue to experience elevated and significant freight costs. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $181 million, an increase of 10% or in constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 4% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.7% compared to the 21.5% we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal year '22. R&D expenses for the quarter was $60 million, an increase of 14%. While on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8%, which is consistent with the prior year. We continue to make significant investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and digital solutions will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be in the vicinity of 7% during fiscal year '22. Total amortization of required intangibles was $19 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $260 million, an increase of 7% underpinned by strong revenue growth. As I reported last quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserve of $255 million during the previous quarter, which was net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement of transfer pricing audits by the Australian Taxation Office or ATO. During the quarter, we progressed our settlement discussions with the ATO and have refined our tax reserve estimate. As a result, we have determined the required reserve is $249 million or $6 million lower than the previous quarter estimate. And accordingly, we have recorded this as reduction in our GAAP tax expense in the June quarter. Next steps involve concluding a written agreement with the ATO and obtaining final approvals from each side, which we hope to achieve this quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 18.4%. While on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rates for FY '21 was 18.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for fiscal year '22 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $198 million, an increase of 3%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.35, an increase of 2%. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $195 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $227 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $28 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $1.3 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the Verily joint venture, now called Primasun. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $2 million for the quarter for fiscal year '22 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $295 million. At June 30, we had $655 million in gross debt, and $360 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest. And at June 30, we had a further $1.6 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share. This represents an increase of 8% over the previous quarterly dividend and reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Citus Health. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Rob, let's go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call. I will turn it over to you to provide instructions and get going.
Operator: Thank you, Amy. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Pleased proceed with your question.
John Deakin-Bell: Thanks very much. My question was just around the likely mix going forward. You've talked about that $300 million to $350 million impact from the recall, but we noticed quite a big difference in the growth rates in the U.S versus rest of the world in the quarter for devices. Can you just give us a feel for, firstly, why there was such a difference in the U.S versus the rest of the world for the quarter? And then going forward, how you think that mix might look in FY '22?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, John. And, yes, look, it's really exciting to be able to provide $300 million to $350 million in incremental revenue for our shareholders, but devices for much needed patients out there over the coming fiscal year. And we actually we hope to get better than that as we look for more parts and pieces and components. That's our current forecast. Look, just breaking down the device numbers for the quarter, really strong device numbers for the U.S., at plus 30%. That was off the comp. If you remember this time a year-ago where sleep devices were way down and ventilators were picking up in the U.S., I think it was around plus 1% the comp, and so huge turnaround there plus 30% in this last quarter. And then in EMEA, Asia and rest of world this time last year, we had plus 35% growth because we had really strong ventilator sales, particularly to some Asia Pacific regions in their COVID crisis. And so that combo plus 35% was being analyzed, and we saw a minus 6% for EMEA, Asia and rest of world. So it's a combination, John of multiple factors of COVID for both those sort of regions, U.S., Canada, Latin America, plus 30% versus EMEA, Asia and rest of world lapping a plus 30% at their minus 6%. So as we project for the $300 million to $350 million, I think that's probably the most guidance we've ever given around an opportunity like this. I'm not going to split that by region, or by type or by area. But I can tell you, its supply chain constrained, not demand constrained. And everyone in all the 140 countries wants ResMed products. And everyone we make we sell and we are doing everything we can to drive more and more elements in our supply chain, wherever that bottleneck is in supply, whatever that part or pieces. I personally as the CEO, I'm calling up that supplier and talking to their CEO and saying, look, this component can go into a cell phone or a car, or it can go into a medical device that literally gives someone the gift of breathe. Please prioritize our part of the supply chain, and it's been working those last 7 weeks. We've been able to match $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue. And our goal is to continue every week, every month to do better and better on that.
John Deakin-Bell: Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Hurren of MST. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Hurren: Good morning, everyone. Mick, thanks very much for that additional information, the $300 million to $350 million. We're just trying to understand how that plays out over the year. And I guess we're trying to understand what the exit run rate would be on that plan as an uplift of your normal operations. So I guess, looking at how linear that will be and what sort of shape you'll be as you exited the full year?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Dan, it's a good question. And I don't want to get into a sort of breakdown every 90 days approach on it. But what I can say in terms of color, Dan, for your modeling is that, we found out about this 7.5 weeks ago, and we've been working like crazy these last 2 months on the supply chain. And it's easy to open up supply 3 months out, 6 months out, 9 months out. So a lot of the additional flow of parts and pieces is back end loaded in the fiscal year. And so, much less supply chain constrained in the March quarter, and the June quarter of this fiscal year '22 we're in. And it's going to be tough out here. We're already in the September quarter, and we're hand to mouth. But look, we're not stockpiling. We're not putting stuff in inventory. We are pushing stuff through plants. Our plants aren't at full capacity, so we have capacity. It's really around components and parts and pieces that are the bottlenecks. And so, if you think about that color, it sort of gives you guidance to know that Q3 and Q4 will be a lot less constrained than Q1 and Q2. Q2 should be slightly better than Q1 and Q3 should be significantly better than Q2, and Q4 should be significantly better than Q2 and Q1 as well.
Dan Hurren: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
David Bailey: Yes, good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. [Indiscernible] I mean, that's great additional detail on $300 million and $350 million. Is that devices [indiscernible] or is that the entire opportunity, as you said currently capturing consumables as well as ventilator -- any incremental ventilator sales coming through?
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, that's a good clarification. So the $300 million to $350 million is incremental devices, including Astral, Stellar, AirCurve, Lumis as well as AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. So it's all physical product devices. It does not include any potential upside in masks that you can get while selling great flow generated capabilities. And so it doesn't include incremental sales of those. It's focused on the device side, but both ventilation and sleep apnea devices are included in that number.
David Bailey: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just on the -- on a new patient coming in to the system, into observations over the last 12 months, I mean what sort of proportion should we think about of new patients that have a ResMed device also have ResMed [indiscernible] ResMed consumables. Is there a sort of a rough number, you're able to provide to try and understand what that could look like?
Mick Farrell: Yes, I see where you're going with the question. It's sort of trying to get to the understanding of how much incremental mask share we might get when they're on a ResMed device. Look, as you know, it's an open system. And there's no requirement that a ResMed device has a ResMed mask. They are designed by the same engineers and the same building out there in Sydney, in the manufacturing -- advanced manufacturing site across the road. So they design to work together very well and they are better together. So there is a better uptake of ResMed masks with ResMed devices. And certainly, it's going through a channel where there's a sales person who's providing both of them. And so there's some opportunities on both the sort of clinical and technical side as well as the commercial and execution side for some incremental growth. I won't quantify that for you. But I do think there is some upside.
David Bailey: That's great. Thank you, Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question
Sean Laaman: Thank you, and good morning, Mick and team. Mick, my question relates to the commonality between components of the various devices. Is that -- is there a lot of commonality between the S 10 and S 11 platform. So therefore, the challenges of the same with respect to sourcing and does the 3x increase to capacity from your competitor compound [indiscernible] the picture for you? Thanks, Mick.
Mick Farrell: Yes, Sean, two very good questions and very much related. Yes, I think there is some overlap of some of the parts and pieces between the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 platform. It's 7 years newer in the market. And so there's a lot of upgraded electronic, mechanical, plastic and digital health technology in the device. And so there's a lot of new components as well. And there is demand from our competitor out there trying to cover their recall amount as well as catch up with the patients that need urgent replacements. We're not seeing as much of the latter, though. We have a supply chain that have some overlaps with some of our competitors, but actually very individually designed. And as we work through the supply chains, the whole medical device industry is a very small percentage point of the suppliers total capacity, which is great for us in that. We're not fighting for limited share versus a competitor, we're really fighting for share versus a large consumer phone company or automobile company and the suppliers, like medical devices, because firstly, we're relatively recession resistant. We don't suddenly stop our sales during the recession, as some people do in consumer purchases and automotive, and we're usually high margin for them. So -- and more sustainable growth in terms of what we're doing for our platforms. The AirSense 10 has been in the market for 7 years. And so these are long-term sustainable for them. So our arguments are very good with the supply chain. And that's why in the last 7 weeks, we've been able to identify that extra $300 million to $350 million in opportunity. But there is some commonality between our devices. And we will make those trade-offs and that's why we will provide both AirSense 10 and AirSense 11. But the AirSense 11 is a huge leap forward to the industry and our goal will be country-by-country to roll that out. But, yes, for the next 6, 12 months, there's going to be a lot of selling both the fantastic AirSense 10 and the amazing AirSense 11 in parallel in countries around the world.
Sean Laaman: Great color, Mick. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Maggie Nolan: Hey, this is Maggie on from Margaret today. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the assumption of the $300 million to $350 million. So, in that assumption, are you assuming that new patients or is that going to be swapping your competitors existing patients. And then is there a potential here for more than your current revenue assumptions, if that incremental supply can be located a bit earlier than your current expectations. And then taking a one step further and looking out to fiscal year 2023, how are you guys looking at the tail of the benefit post recall? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Okay. Great, Maggie. This -- I think four great questions in your question there. I'll address the first half of that, and then I'll hand over to maybe Jim Hollings to address some of the latter questions about long-term. Firstly, yes, we are focused on new patients as they come through. We’re the number one provider in almost all of the 140 countries that we're in, but the competitive with this recall was often the number two to our number one position. And so there's a lot of demand for new patient flow, and that's where we're focused, that’s where we're laser focused. Frankly, it's their job to focus on replacement or recall, that was their job and their duty to go take care of those patients, and we're focused on the new patients, both together will create unprecedented demand in the market. So that's point one. We are focused on new patients. At a high-level, as we look out beyond sort of this competitive recall to say, what's the steady state as we get to fiscal '23 and towards the end of fiscal '22, I do think, as I said in the prepared remarks that we will achieve a permanent market share increase from this. ResMed has always been the quality leader, always been the clinical leader, always been the smallest class and most comfortable. But there were some customers who just been used to, the old devices from an American brand that was bought by the Dutch company for a long time, they just stuck with what they had. I think that will get a chance to experience. The [indiscernible] improvement, the efficiency improvement, the doctors being excited about having full digital on AirView and patients being excited about the interaction on MyAir and [indiscernible] that they get patients happy, physicians happy and provider happy because a happy patient is one who is buying masks because they need them on a replenishment basis. So I won't quantify it for you. But I do think there's a magnificent opportunity for us to get our technology in front of a whole new range of customers. On the other hand, where supplies are constrained right now, so we're focused on our existing customers and taking care of them and making sure that we can get the new patients set up for them. But Jim, any other color, you think on sort of changes to the market conditions and longer term implications?
James Hollings: Yes, thanks, Mick and thanks, Maggie, for your question. I would say on long-term, as we were preparing to launch AirSense 11, our plan was to take market share, to take device share with the offering because the AirSense 11 offering both the device and the software we think is by far the best offering on the market. We're introducing at launch a number of innovations and the platform because of its connectivity allows us to introduce even more software innovations post-launch on an ongoing basis. And so as Mick said in his opening comments, we feel very confident that with AirSense 10 and AirSense 11, we have the two best sleep therapy devices on the market. So that was our plan all along. And I think that our competitors recall simply creates a window of opportunity for us, as Mick [indiscernible] to familiarize more customers, more patients with the innovations and to streamline workflows for providers and to provide, continually improving the patient experience on therapy, which drives up adherence, improves outcomes for patients and all of our stakeholders then winners with that. So we felt very confident as we were launching and I think the circumstances give us even more of an opportunity.
Maggie Nolan: Great. Thanks so much.
Mick Farrell: Maggie.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Paine with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Paine: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just looking at the supply chain issues, in particular, semiconductors, what can you do to actually increasing supply there. I noted last year you got 38 million semiconductors from Infineon to the COVID response. Are you able to get more access to semiconductors due to your position within the medical -- the health care system?
Mick Farrell: Andrew, great question. I'll address maybe the first half and hand to Rob Douglas to talk a little bit to that. But look, I can tell you, as CEO, traditionally I'm taken into discussions with major customers, talking to the large multinational customers around the world and governments that we provide these great therapies and solutions for so that I can engage with them and talk about our great value. But at the moment I'm not doing that, because customer demand is almost infinite. And I'm being taken by my global supply team to talk to suppliers. And Andrew without naming individuals, I know that individual supply was named during the COVID crisis at their request, we are going and I'm spending time not just 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 steps up our supply chain and talking to people who make these basic plastics, electronics and components and parts and pieces and telling them. Sometimes they're unaware that further down the supply chain there's a life support ventilator or a non-invasive ventilator or a sleep apnea device that cures and treats sleep suffocation. And so just getting me that opportunity, firstly, it's very interesting for me. It's a new dynamic, and we're getting really good response from these suppliers. They also are under difficult supply chain conditions and often asked me to go with them further up the supply chain to talk to someone else. And it's a game of sort of bottleneck -- debottlenecking, if you like, in the global supply chain. We have a very advanced engineering team that are looking all day every day in our global supply alliance internally, led by Linda Laidlaw and her team and Andrew Price and his team. And they are pulling me in and doing much more themselves all day, every day to drive that. So it's an ongoing opportunity for us. It's a supply chain opportunity, but unique through the COVID impacts on freight costs and impacts on freight availability, but also the growth that we see ahead due to this unique situation. Rob any more color to talk about there on about supply chain for -- to Andrew's question?
Rob Douglas: Yes, a few other factors, Mick. One is, after following up with COVID last year, when we rapidly ramp ventilation, usually for that ramp, you've got to put in longer term commitments. So we did have actually a lot of commitments on the ventilator devices going forward. And that will be helpful for us. As Mick said, we can always make a better case than a cyclical consumer product. And in fact, one of the key factors around that not only residing lives, but also for these supplies, we can give them very long-term forecasts that we usually hit and do really well. So we're able to give long-term forecasts and we know they like that and they can plan that in. The forecast is stable. It's unusual to have the sort of sudden increments that we've had as a result of recent industry events. And so we're putting that in and pulling stuff forward. But also given out, just the number of patients we've got to treat and where we are in the market, we're able to make some really solid long-term commitments with the suppliers as well. And so that really, really helps. And we will see, our commitment horizon actually had go quite a lot longer than what traditionally it's been. And then the other fact that Mick mentioned briefly also is we've got a really strong design team. And where there are sort of acute bottlenecks on particular components, we can forward design around those, but those design changes do take time. And they've got to be properly validated and tested and very rigorous testing on these products. So we can't just rapidly switch to a new component. But we can plan some months out that we'll be able to add in additional sources of components. So as you can imagine, this is sort of full core press for our supply chain and engineering teams and they're going flat out on this.
Andrew Paine: That's great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Cooper: Thanks, Mick and Brett. Can I just ask about the cost side of the equation. I mean, presumably, given the competition for chips here that you've been referring to through the call, I mean, it would be reasonable to assume that the cost side of the $300 million to $350 million is just going to be elevated versus what we normally see if you're business. And if that is the case, are you going to need to try and offset some of that pressure with price?
Mick Farrell: Chris, that's a good question. I'll hand to Brett to talk a little bit around the costs and how we're taking care of those. And Rob, if he wants to chime in as well. Look, this is an unprecedented time. Before our competitor made this announcement, 7 weeks ago, there was already constraints in the market around some of the components. And certainly because of nobody travelling really internationally, consumer travel was down so much and all the freight in the back of those consumer jets was gone. The costs were higher. And look, we talked about this 90 days ago on our last earnings call, and you saw it in the COGS numbers for this June quarter. And that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, these, these costs aren't going away. It is more costly to get freight than it was because there's much less planes available. And it is -- with scarce components, although we have very long-term contracts, prices are being impacted by that. At the same time, we're in an environment where we have customers with contracts with payers, and the consumer side of our business, there might be some opportunity to work with the supply chain to think about how to get some of those costs through the channel. But certainly in the reimburse side of the market, it's about and you've got to think really long-term about on the other side of this crisis, how we and our customers going to engage in our long-term interactions. And so it's a complex equation. And -- but, Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to what we're doing to negotiate to achieve the best prices that we can get and to manage our gross margin there and the COGS there. And, maybe Jim talked to how we're working with customers on long-term pricing. So Brett, and then Jim.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Thanks, Mike. I mean, we do -- Chris, we do. I mean, obviously, and Rob mentioned that kind of, we have some of these longer term commitments that are contractually so that helps us there. But if you look at an industry wide, I think for electronic components, you are seeing price pressures there. So I think over the course of the year, you expects, I think, some increases on those components there. We can mitigate that to some extent with some of these longer term contractual arrangements. So that is a pressure point, if you like on our cost side. And then freight, definitely as Nick mentioned, that remains pretty elevated. And for a number of reasons, and just really even getting slots and so on, that's a freight. That’s even into even containers now for [indiscernible]. So that I think we will continue some -- probably for this year. With that, you think -- I don't think the freight is going to be [indiscernible] I think that will resolve itself over time. But I think for the over the course of this fiscal, I think that's going to remain as a cost pressure for us.
Rob Douglas: If I just pick up on the price topic, very quickly, I think Mick has covered in broadly quite well. But if you think of our industry, it's historically been a price down industry, right. And that's because reimbursements come down, and prices come down, because we as manufacturers have been able to drive down the materials and move the industry in that direction while preserving margins. Our customers still are very constrained on their ability to pass on any price increases that they face, because for the most part, they're either have government reimbursement or they have some sort of contracted reimbursement with a commercial payer. And those reimbursements have remained static or come down over time. So as we think about what we might be able to do pass price forward, we have to be very thoughtful about how we accomplish that if we can do it. And then couple that with the fact that we're also in contracts with most of our customers, right? So we might be in a tender contract with the government payer or many of our larger customers. We've contracts around for 12 months, that have a renewal cycle and that sort of thing. So I think that we've done very good job of being disciplined in pricing and maintaining price stability. And we'll be very, very thoughtful as we think about any kind of price changes that we do over time. But I think the circumstances are quite unique. And we really want to preserve long standing relationships with our customers who are really our partners in the channel.
Chris Cooper: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning. Well, I'd like to continue with that line of thought. You mentioned there that with some of the larger customers, obviously, you've got contracts with them. Can you talk a little bit about whether those contracts with those larger customers to what extent they might have volume pricing in terms of that wholesale price? Is that with more volumes going through? Is that likely to squeeze margins further?
Mick Farrell: Jim, I'll hand that question to you. It's a follow up really to your response to the previous question. Yes, that’s a terrific question. And we're actually in many way -- in many cases working through those contract negotiations in real time, I think that we have pretty good clarity with most of our customers that this is an unusual set of circumstances. And so we have a number of customers. And this varies a lot by geography, for everybody to understand. But we have we do have a number of customers who have, need volume based or rebate -- volume based rebates or pricing levels. And this is an unusual set of circumstances that drive more volume into those accounts. And so those are contracts we're working through in real time, but they're not uncapped discounts. And we're managing those conversations, I think very carefully. This is in a way, the flip side of the previous question where because we have relationships with customers who understand the dynamic of what's going on, we're able to negotiate pretty, pretty good price stability. So there's no risk for us of runaway in a sort of runaway discounts and rebates. And on the other hand, we're, working to create a kind of a stable pricing environment for our customers as well.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne.
Operator: Next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
David Low: Thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to meet on mass resupplied, we had load or I had worried that with the recall that we might see a lot of patients stop using their device, particularly given that was the advice. And that would have a flow on effect to everyone's resupply programs. Now we can see the numbers today and then [multiple speakers] growth, obviously, it's not matching up with device sales growth by any means. And I know there's a lot of factors in that. But just wonder if you could talk to that risk and what your expectations are on that front, please.
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, there was some confusion after the June 14 announcement, but I think many of the regulatory authorities and many of the clinician groups came out pretty quickly to say, let's talk to you doctor and work out a risk pathway between now and when you get that replacement device from that competitor. And also, for new patients, the doctors and certainly all of us in the industry we're very focused on the safe and effective therapies from ResMed and other players in the market. And so I think that that messaging was actually pretty quickly put out there by those physician societies and relevant health authorities after somewhat confusing announcements, right on that June 14 from our competitor. And so long-term, there's been some impacts that are quite beneficial in patients making that trade off. And certainly for us, you saw plus 5% growth in masks in the quarter for the U.S., you saw plus 24% growth in Europe, over a COVID [indiscernible] there, but very, very solid growth in our mask business. As you said, there's a bunch of factors, David, that this time last year, we had all the ventilation Mark sales, because it in the U.S which was, you know, a confident we were was like a headwind. And the other headwind, we had was the annualization of the snap acquisition, which we did just before COVID, we closed it just in that sort of February through June period. And then, there's some balancing of inventory and cash flow due to the competitive recall all going on at once. And so a lot of competing dynamics, but as you saw, it's a resilient business. When people getting great sleep apnea therapy, they love feeling better, sleeping well and waking up refreshed, and they want to get a new mask every three or six months. And they're doing it at increasing rates due to COVID, that step change has remained. And we're confident, we look through the fiscal year that we're going to see, mid single-digit up to high single-digit growth. In our mask business and it's all about us engaging with those, those patients getting new patients on board. As we talked about some incremental revenue opportunities, they're on the devices, maybe some of the masks, and then we get back to where we were before, right. And we go back to engaging patients, ensuring they stay on therapy, and they have really quick and easy access to resupply, if they want it and when they want it, and when it's covered by insurance and co pays and everything.
David Low: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.
David Low: All right. Good afternoon, guys. And thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just to switch it up for at least one question. Are there any meaningful milestones for Propeller or Verily -- or the Verily JV in FY '22 that you could that you would like to call out, and as the loss is a lower loss on the JV, because it's now generating some revenue.
David Low: Thanks, Matthew. And it's great to have a question that sort of looking out beyond the next 12 months, given the dynamics I'm not surprised by that. I'll take the first part on the joint venture with Verily and hand to Jim to talk a little bit more about Verily and also about Propeller and other great development opportunities we have across our portfolio in sleep and respiratory care. Yes, firstly, the joint venture with Verily. Its name -- now its Primasun. And so we've got the branding out there. And we have Jonathon Lobbins, fantastic CEO that comes to us from Edwards Lifesciences, and other large med tech companies that he's been a part of, and really exciting to have a new CEO there. He's a strong leader, and the ability to identify, engage and enroll. What I call sleep concerned consumers into a digital pathway and a treatment pathway for sleep apnea is incredible and some really good experiments happening in certain metropolitan statistical areas with that technology and so great to have a new leader and the opportunity. The milestones are really around those MSIS and the success we're having before will scale. And obviously, given the current industry dynamics, we don't need to drive demand right now. We have unprecedented, almost unlimited demand, but we're doing lots of pilots and lots of testing and I can see as we get towards our 2023 and we analyze all this and we're moving towards that 2025 strategy. That Primasun joint venture will create incredible opportunities to identify and engage and enroll the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate and want to find a pathway to treatment for their sleep apnea. Jim, any other thoughts about Primasun or Propeller or any other great developments you've got on the horizon in SRC [ph]?
James Hollings:  I would say just in specific to Propeller, we remain very excited about Propeller as a part of our portfolio. And, like a lot of number of things, over the last 18 months, the headwinds for Propeller were largely driven by their customer base, focusing on COVID. So, a big part of Propeller's business is working with payers and with health systems to drive adoption of their digital solutions, and there was just distraction in their customer base for many months, obviously. So we're starting to see some more traction in those conversations as COVID starts to decline, and the market starts to stabilize. And we've taken the opportunity during that span to do to continue to develop our capabilities in Propeller and I would say -- just a couple of highlights, I would say, we've added quite a lot of muscle to the commercial side of that business by adding talent into the business. And we've also been working hard behind the scenes to build out the cloud architecture and make sure that Propeller's cloud architecture is paired up really nicely matching and kind of aligned with ResMed's overall cloud architecture for our other digital offerings. And all of that kind of investment is just going to accelerate Propeller's traction in the market as we continue to accelerate digital offerings across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about it. I think that material revenues out of Propeller are a couple of years away in all likelihood, but as we get more milestones and do things like sign contracts we will keep everybody apprised.
Operator: Thank you. We are now approaching the 75 minute mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks, Rob and thanks to all of you for sticking around a little long. Clearly some unique circumstances in this perfect storm. Thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call today. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank 8,000 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people breathe better, sleep better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today, and every day, and thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this global private crisis, including patient care provider support and hospitals, production, global supply chain management, distribution, and tech service. Once again, thank you. And I'd like to thank all of you, our shareholders for joining us here and we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much. Great. Thanks, Mick and thank you again for joining us today. We do appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Rob, you may now close it up.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-04-29 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2021 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Celin, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Celin. Hello, everyone and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. We appreciate you joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today along with the copy of the earnings release and presentation, both of which are available now. With me on the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes in today's earnings press release or in the appendix of the earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review result of the March quarter, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021. On today's call, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q3 business metrics. And then I'll hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. I will review progress towards ResMed 2025 strategic goals including execution highlights against our quarterly and our annual operating priorities. A year ago, today when we discussed our March 2020 results, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of business particularly in the United States had not yet been significantly impacted. However, outside the U.S., countries including China and Italy were already in the midst of emergency needs. We quickly mobilize our supply-chain and global operations to address and support ventilation needs world-wide, producing other 150,000 ventilators. We accelerate the production and distribution of noninvasive and life support ventilators in mask systems to those in need, resulting in an incremental $35 million of COVID related revenue during the March 2020 quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how we quickly pivoted business to meet that need, providing life citing solutions around the world, so that healthcare systems were prepared with the resources needed to treat patients who are fighting COVID-19. Today, one year later, the countries we operate in are various different stages of the post COVID peak recovery process in terms of getting to normal patient flow. We see a range of from 70% of pre-COVID patient flow in some countries, up to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow in other countries. Vaccines are steadily rolling out in the United States, the U.K. and many other countries worldwide. We still see significant impacts from ongoing second, third and fourth waves infection in some countries in Europe, as well as in South America and Asia. And especially right now, in the country of Brazil and particularly India. Our team is working with hospitals and healthcare providers in those two countries and beyond for preservation of life, making sure that they have ventilators, masks and the training that they need to use them. We continue to support the frontline respiratory therapists and the physicians who are there on the ground, as well as providers, patients and ResMedians throughout their 140 plus countries that we operate in. Were pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing and getting new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients diagnosed, excluding the $35 million of COVID related ventilator sales in the March 2020 quarter, our team delivered positive sales growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business this quarter on both the headline and constant currency basis. We forecast a steady improvement trend of patient flow for sleep apnea and COPD and asthma continuing as we move through 2021 and into 2022. We expect this progress to accelerate as global vaccination rates continue. We are encouraged to see that patients, physicians and providers around the world are adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, home-based testing, remote patient monitoring, and ongoing patient management. I'd like to be clear that the ventilation sales that we made in 2020 will be part of our comparables for the next two quarters. In the June 2020 quarter, we recognize $125 million in COVID related ventilator sales. And in September 2020 quarter, we recognized $40 million in such revenue. Over the coming quarters we expect to continue to show strong positive year-over-year revenue growth excluding these onetime sales from 2020. As we look further forward, we see a clear path to double digit revenue growth in the back half of our fiscal year 2022 across our full business, powered by opening economies and our pipeline of new technology and innovation. Our headline results were impacted this quarter by an accounting reserves. We talk in connection with discussions with the Australian Tax Office or ATR regarding their ongoing order getting back to fiscal year 2009. Brett has been leading those discussions and we'll speak to the details in his remarks. I will make this statement, ResMed pay significant taxes in countries around the world and we operate in over 140 countries helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives well away from the hospital. Brett and his team are working towards a final resolution of these transfer pricing discussions turning back over 12 years with the ATR. So we have taken this $255 million reserve. We believe that resolving these discussions is the pragmatic thing to do for all of our stakeholders, so that we can put this behind us and focus all of our efforts on our core mission of improving lives in respiratory medicine around the world. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $196 million in operating cash, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders. We also increased our R&D investments in the period in digital health technology, as well as R&D for hardware, embedded software and clinical research, while maintaining financial discipline with reduced SG&A and other operating costs. We are seeing increased demand for our digital health solutions from patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems around the world as they embrace remote patient engagement and adopt population health management. We are the clear leader in this field with over 14 million cloud connectable medical devices in the market. And our ongoing and increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure we provide superior value to patients, physicians and providers to be their partner of choice. We don't take our leading market share position for granted. We fight for it every day through innovation. Our digital technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long term value with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 8000 patents and designs. We now have over 8.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud based platform called air solutions. We have over 15.5 patients enrolled in our cloud based AirView software solution. And we also have over 105 million patients manage within our software as a service network for out-of-hospital healthcare. These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customers, patients, physicians, providers, as well as private and government payers. Let me take a few minutes to share some recent clinical highlights that show how we are working with researchers to advance the field of sleep and respiratory medicine with these data and beyond. During 2020, an important 30-year duration study was published in the European respiratory journal following over 4,500 diagnosed OSA patients to better understand the long term impacts of untreated sleep apnea. The study showed that untreated sleep apnea leads to high incidence of myocardial infarction or heart attack, high incidence and prevalence of Type II diabetes and high incidence of ischemic heart disease. This real world clinical analysis is showing what we've known for over three decades. Sleep apnea is a public health epidemic that simply can't be ignored. In terms of clinical quality of life improvement from CPAP therapy, the data are also clear. In late 2019, the multicenter randomized controlled trial called MERGE was published in the journal, Lancet Respiratory Medicine. The results were that patients randomized to CPAP demonstrated clear improvement in quality of life for CPAP patients versus standard of care with symptomatic benefits, including reductions in sleepiness, as well as improvements in fatigue, and importantly, depression, a key part of mental health. Importantly, these results were evident in both mild as well as moderate and severe sleep apnea. In terms of economic data, and a dose response relationship from CPAP therapy, the data are also unequivocal. In 2019, a study was published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showing the quantified dose response relationship from CPAP therapy. So, for every additional hour of Positive Airway Pressure use, there was an 8% decrease in hospital inpatient visits, and a 4% decrease in overall physician visits. In other words, treating sleep apnea without sleep therapy not only improves lives, it also saves money for the healthcare system by lowering total healthcare utilization costs. During the quarter, we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the Agency for Healthcare, Research and Quality, or AHRQ here in the U.S. market. AHRQ sought input and ResMed file public comments, along with comments from many physician groups, sleep apnea patient advocates, provider groups, and beyond. I won't repeat all the details of those public comments, but I will say this, we presented peer reviewed and published data showing that CPAP therapy improves quality of life, reduces healthcare costs, and even reduces mortality. In short, these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market, we are saving lives and saving money for the healthcare system through our medical technology. We have peer reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack, a reduction in hypertension, as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors. All of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with CPAP therapy in treated sleep apnea patients. We are encouraged by technical studies completed by the National Institute of Clinical Effectiveness. The acronym is nice in the U.K. Just last month NICE may publish there 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that CPAP therapy along with telemonitoring is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild OSA. That would be an expansion of coverage in the U.K., and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market. Similarly, the ministries of health in France, Germany and Japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in the space. It's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as government see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total healthcare system costs with this technology. While we respect the work of AHRQ, we, along with many other academic research focus institutes and practicing physician groups believe that they bypass a generation of data in real world evidence that needs to be taken into account along with their own select group of RCTs in the draft report. We are optimistic that the final report when issued we'll reflect the preponderance of real world evidence and broader RCTs showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure. Okay, let me now update you on our top three, ResMed strategic priorities. These are, one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices, as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably in a person's home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night. The rate of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy in the U.S. was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the March quarter, primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year. This season, in fact, affects devices more than mask systems, given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the two categories. We expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality. We continue to see strong ongoing mask and accessory resupply in the U.S. market and beyond. New patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent COVID related case surges in select countries in Asia and Europe, including two large markets France and Germany. We see that impact the number of patients going for clinical based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries. We expect to see these markets reopen along with hospitals, as vaccines continue to roll out, and as we see further scaling of the remote home-based diagnostic capacity. Clearly the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control. However, we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners, which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes. More broadly, we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. And we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter. Importantly, our market leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices. And we're excited about our future pipeline. We rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who've followed us for very time now. But today I would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next generation sleep apnea platform. You may have seen some recent U.S. regulatory filings that we made for our next generation, flow generator platform called the AirSense 11. Clearly, there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step. But we are making good progress. Earlier this month, we started a limited controlled product launch of the AirSense 11 in certain parts of the United States. We expect to move to a broader commercial launch of the platform later this calendar year in the U.S. and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that. For now I can say that as a personal user of our CPAP therapy, I have firsthand knowledge that the AirSense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners. And our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians, providers, payers and beyond, and ultimately continue to catalyze ResMed's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for COPD, asthma and other chronic diseases. We make the smallest, quietest, smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market. Importantly, they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence, improve clinical outcomes, and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers on health care systems. Let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million COPD or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions including both non invasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas, such as cloud connected pharmaceutical drugs delivery devices and high flow therapy devices. Our respiratory care business benefited in the March 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilator devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic. During the March 2021 quarter COVID related ventilator sales were not material to the global business. However, we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest COVID surges, such as just this month with the surge in India. And we're getting many 1000s of devices to those in need, the demand is there in that country. But as in Q3, we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business. Even though the broader impact particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless, and incredibly important to not only our local team in India, but to all of us here at ResMed worldwide. Demand for our core non invasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for COPD and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea. We are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago. We are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world. The value being provided through this cloud-based software solution has been fruitful not only during the COVID pandemic and the peak parts of the crisis, but it's also valuable on an ongoing value basis for physicians as well as the healthcare systems they operate in. We are helping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care. Let me now review our software as a service business for out-of-hospital care. During the quarter our SAAS business grew in the mid single digits year-on-year across our portfolio of markets. The verticals include home medical equipment, Brightree HME, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, private duty home care, home infusion, senior living and life planned communities. Our HME customers are leveraging our advanced resupply solutions, including SNAP technology and Brightree resupply for our existing portfolio of patients. And they are contributing to ongoing growth as the flow of new patients in HME continues to recover steadily period by period. Over the past 12 months COVID-19 has had a dampening effect on elective and emergent procedures at hospitals as we all know, and that has slowed hospital discharge rates affecting patient flow and ultimately, the centers rates at skilled nursing facilities home health, hospice and beyond. As the rate of vaccinations accelerate across the U.S. and the number of COVID-19 cases continues to trend downward in this country, we're seeing improvements in the census rates across skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and across all post acute care settings. In addition to the solid organic growth that we're seeing in our SaaS business, we closed an exciting acquisition just this month. The company is called Citus Health. Citus is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions for home infusion and specialty pharmacy, as well as the home health and hospice markets. Citus enhances the patient experience and it also improves provider efficiency and reduces the workload for frontline clinicians and caregivers. We are excited to have the Citus team as part of the ResMed family of solutions and to leverage their digital collaboration and patient support platform in our mission to improve patients lives outside the hospital. I'm very impressed by the breadth and depth of talent at Citus and their passion for patient care. This goes from their CEO, and co-founder, all the way to the front line. We're very excited to have them join our team and we will be better together. As we look across our portfolio solutions for Brightree to MatrixCare to now Citus, including HME, specialty pharmacy, home infusion, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, senior living, life plan communities and private duty home care. We expect this portfolio, this SAAS portfolio of revenue growth to accelerate, increasing for mid single digit growth that we saw in this quarter to high single digit growth as we move forward. As always, our goal is to meet or beat these sort of market average growth rates and we continue to take share across the verticals that we're in. We also see opportunity to drive growth through further acquisitions that will augment and add to our existing portfolio of solutions. Our offerings are very well received in each of these verticals and we continue to see and leverage analytics and the technology that we have across our core business and the SAAS business to help people age in place, and minimize or eliminate acute care episodes. Looking at the broader ResMed portfolio of business across sleep, and respiratory care as well as our software as a service solutions, we remain confident in our long term strategy and our pipeline of innovative solutions. Our mission to improve lives, drives and motivates with millions across the world every day. COVID has highlighted and continues to highlight the importance of respiratory health and respiratory hygiene. It is highlighted also the importance of digital health and remote care. And it has also accelerated awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient, screening, diagnosis, setup, as well as remote patient management and monitoring. We've continued to invest aggressively in R&D and innovation to ensure our solutions are best-in-class and are a catalyst for future growth. With 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment, and engagement of people with our digital health pathways. We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across the 140 countries that we operate in. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude for more than 7,500 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during these most unusual circumstances these last 15 months. This team has helped save the lives literally of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with ventilators. With these emergency needs. The team has now rapidly pivoted back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma. And for all those who need world-class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own home. Thank you. With that, I will now hand the call over to Brent in Sydney. And then we will move to Q&A. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today I will provide an overview of our results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 and comment on our FY 2022 outlook. Unless noted, all comparison are to the prior year quarter. Great revenue for the last quarter was $769 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Consistent with our prediction during the Q2 earnings call, we drew off negligible incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the March quarter, where their prior year to revenue included an incremental benefits from COVID-19 we've added sales of approximately $35 million. Excluding the impact, they actually carry FY 2021 revenue increased by 1% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, a 1000 us Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase in 2%. Prior to Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $272 million, a decrease of 5% or a decrease of 13% in constant glassy terms. By product segment, U.S. Canada and Latin America device sales were 193 million, a decrease of 2%. Mask and other sales with 210 million an increase of 7%. Europe, Asia and other markets, the cost sales totaled $173 million, a decrease of 11% or in constant currency terms, 18% decrease. Now, when I was out in Europe, Asia and other markets were 99 million an increase of 9% or flat year over year in constant currency terms. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales decreased by 10%, while masks and other sales increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 related sales in the prior year quarter, Global device sales declined by 3% in constant currency terms, while masks and other sales increased by 6% in constant currency terms. Software as a service revenue for the third quarter was $94 million, an increase of 5% than the prior year quarter. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased by 40 basis points to 59.6% in the March quarter compared to 60% in the same quarter last year. The interest is predominantly attributable to higher freight costs, additional manufacturing costs associated with the transition to our new Singapore site we'll commenced operations during the quarter, and geographic mix changes. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $160 million, a decrease of 7% or in constant currency term SG&A expenses decreased by 11% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 20.9% compared to the 22.4% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q4 FY 2021 to increase in the low single digit relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $56 million, an increase of 9% or in constant currency basis, an increase of 3%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 6.7% in the prior year. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses in Q4 to increase year-over-year in the high single digits reflecting our long term commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $18 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Our Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $242 million, an increase of 2%, reflecting well contained operating expenses. For the March quarter, we estimated and recorded an accounting tax reserves of $255 million, which is net of credits and deductions for a proposed settlement and third-party audits by the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO. The audits covered tax year 2009 to 2018 [ph], as previously disclosed for 2009 to 2013. The OTO issued assessment of $256 million inclusive of penalties and interest. The 2014 to 2018 year audits remain open, ongoing and assessments have not been issued. We have tentatively agreed on a number with the ATO to resolve the entire matter for all years. We expect any adjustments to reserve will be taking this quarter would be material. Next steps include getting to a written agreement and final Board approval. If the deal falls apart, we will wait to get. We continue to believe we are more likely than not to succeed in litigation. However, transfer pricing litigation is complex, costly and uncertain. So we are looking forward to putting this behind us. As a result of reporting reserve on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for March quarter was 136%. While our non GAAP basis, which excludes the reserve, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%. Looking forward, we estimate our underlying non-GAAP FY 2021 effective tax rate will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Our Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $190 million, an increase of 1%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30, an increase of 1%. As a result of the tax reserve recorded this quarter, our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $78 million and our GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter was $0.54. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $196 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partly offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $26 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter total $40 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the last quarter associated with Verily joint venture. And going forward we expect to record equity losses in the range of $3 million to $5 million per quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $231 million. At March 31, we had $734 million in gross debt, and $503 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest and in March 31, we had a further $1.5 billion available for drawdown under existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. During the third quarter we completed the acquisition of Citus Health. Citus Health is a digital health leader specializing in patient engagement solutions that enable real time secure collaboration between patients and those involved in the care. We also acquired certain business assets of Tongil Medical company based in Korea, which primarily represented Tongil's sleep and respiratory distribution business. Both these acquisitions will not be material to our group results. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our solid cash flow and liquidity providing flexibility in how we allocate capital. During the pandemic we have focused on paying down debt. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest for growth through R&D. We will also likely continue to deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions like Cypress Hill. We intend to continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend program. We may also resume our share buyback program sometime during the calendar year. This program has been on board since our acquisitions of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal year 2019. Turning now there are expectations on the outlook for Q4, FY 2021 and FY 2022 outlook, The remains uncertainty in the short term particularly interdicting the timing and recovery of the patient flow from COVID-19 related impacts across the many countries we operate in. Consequently, we expect Q4 FY 2021 revenue to reflect low single digit sequential growth over Q3 FY 2021. As we move through FY 2022, we expect to see continued improving in new patient flow and return to more normal I underline revenue growth trends. Additionally, we are seeing minimal COVID-19 generating demand for our ventilators. And do not expect that any material benefit going forward. As a reminder, we recorded 35 million COVID-19 generating revenue in a March last quarter last year, $125 million at June quarter last year, and $40 million in our first quarter of FY 2021. Mask and accessories has continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past three months reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of every supply service offering. We expect to see continued year on year growth of their mask sell in FY 2022. Finally, like many, many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, particularly in relation to the timing of the reopening of economies if the vaccination programs rolled out. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great, thanks, Brett. Saline, I'd like to now turn the call over to you to provide instructions and then run the Q&A portion of the call. Saline, are you there, ready to run the QA portion of the call.
Operator: Excuse me, this is the backup operator. We have a question coming from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning all, and thank you for taking my question. Perhaps I could start with and rest to the world or outside of the United States in America in terms of the device trends you're seeing there. Certainly down 18% on constant currency. Could you help split in terms of what you're seeing in terms of real devices decline without the COVID impact there? And then also, particularly for Germany and France, what you're seeing in that market currently, and what sort of rate it's offering as a percentage of normal, particularly given the increased COVID cases in those countries?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lyanne. And clearly as I said in the prepared remarks, the March 2020, $35 million worth of ventilators were primarily where COVID was impacting them, which was Southwest China, and so probably Hubei province and Northern Italy. So China and Italy. And so clearly, the $35 million worth of sales in the March quarter last year, were predominantly in that rest of world category. So, you can imagine that the actual decline in terms of the COVID impact on year-on-year is significantly below that 18% cc that you talked about, much further below that. And really importantly, when you look at the sort of kinetics of this, and you think about the December quarter to the March quarter, and then what we're going to see in June, we're seeing countries opening up. They're adopting digital health and they're finding ways to make it work. And even in France and Germany where you didn't see lockdowns in the retail side, the healthcare was not as impacted. And our digital health solutions, particularly around remote patient screening diagnosis have been effective. And so, we're seeing that open up as we move forward. Rob, do you want to take the second part of the question?
Rob Douglas: Yes. The Germany and France?
Mick Farrell: Yes.
Rob Douglas: The challenge in Germany and France really in this quarter has been sort of the second waves, which really caused extensive lockdowns and put challenges in there. We had seen sort of incremental opening up, that actually slowed down. It wasn't quite as significant as before, where we really saw all of the sleep labs get converted into COVID wards. But we certainly saw a reduction in new patient flow in most countries as well, there's been a significant issue. In terms of actually breaking out the sort of the device sales in those specific countries without the COVID impact earlier, and I don't think we'll be able to give that sort of granularity to really clarify that for you. But underlying it, we need to understand that those sleep businesses continued, and also you're probably aware that ventilation businesses in Europe are a larger share than what they are with the ResMed business and what they are in terms of the global ResMed business. So there was a factor in that in terms of the relativity to what had happened with the incremental COVID ventilator sales in the previous period.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you very much.
Rob Douglas: Thanks, Lyanne.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just firstly on U.S. devices. What was the performance of underlying CPAP devices next COVID? I'm assuming, there was very limited COVID ventilator sales in the prior year. So I guess when we compare this last quarter, was actually much weaker. So is that because there's less patients coming through the sleep labs? Or were there potentially market share losses? Can you explain what happened from a sequential performance between last quarter and this quarter? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. Good question. And if you look at just U.S., Canada, Latin America, so the Americas numbers, devices were down 2% year-on-year. And if you think about what we're talking about the COVID recovery rates being somewhere between 70% of pre COVID patient flow to 90% of recovered patient flow depending on the country. If you just do that raw math there, that comes out to 98% of pre-COVID, basically, which is not quite there, because there are some replacement devices included there. But certainly, we actually saw very steady market share, some gains in some of the mask areas, but very steady market share in the device side. Some of our competitors are having some difficulties around supply, as well as our global supply chains and other factors going on. We may have even taken some share in the device side. So, what we're seeing just in those U.S. numbers, when you think about sequential from the December to March quarter is really all about, as I said in the prepared remarks around deductibles, resetting those deductibles and impact devices significantly more than masks and accessories. If you look at the masks and accessories, just in that quarter, we saw 7% constant currency growth in masks and accessories in the March quarter year-on-year. But always there's a sequential impact from December to March. And so that's the net. But no actually share very steady, maybe moving up a little on the mask side, very steady on the devices with some modest gains. But the year-on-year 2% decline in devices is truly around the COVID recovery rates. And as we know, the rollout in the U.S. has actually been pretty strong in terms of the vaccinations. I don't think we're quite at the 98%, which would mean, that 2% decline could indicate. But I do think that we are moving well towards the 90% range in some states, and the sort of 80% range and some other states of pre COVID patients flow. But every period we look at, we see improvement in both of those. Thanks for the question Gretel.
Gretel Janu: Thanks very much.
Operator: We have a next question coming in from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned that -- I believe one point in the comments that you expect to return to that double digit underlined growth in the second half of fiscal 2022. And then you were kind enough to give us a series of free instances, while [Indiscernible] suggests will go on the offensive. But the question is, how quickly can those investments take hold? And as you look at the short term, will growth still remain on the bottom of that you shaped that you discussed previously until you get to that second half of the fiscal year? Or can there be meaningful, more meaningful improvements driven by some of these investments? Sorry, I know, it's a long question. But can the U.S. for example, even being further ahead on the vaccination curve actually help you guys and offset maybe some other geographies that are a little weaker? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Margaret. That is a very good question and a thorough one. Look, clearly, we're very confident that the medium to long term of the core business is incredible, given the flow of patients and the flow of our new technology. There are short term dynamics around second and third waves, and then the vaccinations on the positive side and the opening up of the economies on the positive side. As we put it all together, we are very confident that as we get the AirSense 11 from control product launch, to then start to roll that out over this calendar year in the U.S. market, that will be a catalyst for growth. It brings not only the hardware, but also amazing software solutions for patients, physicians, providers, and others. And as we think about the scaling of just the remote patient, digital health models from some of our partners, and identification, engagement and enrollment, all the way through to home sleep, testing and home sleep set up and rolling out of those devices, we're seeing a lot of investments start to pay off on that. So look, it's really hard to get down to the dynamics of how quickly vaccines will go. How quickly economies will open up. But here in the U.S., which is our biggest market, we're certainly seeing both of those trend in a really positive manner. And that led me to talk about pretty bullish sort of double digit growth towards the back end of our fiscal year 2022. And so, I think they're all the dynamics going into it. I don't know Jim Hollings, if you've got any further thoughts as the President of our Sleep and Respiratory Care Business about how quickly we can use that technology to drive growth towards that back end.
James Hollings: Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret, for the question. I really just would reiterate what Mick says. I think that when you think about growth, when we get back to double digit growth, the numbers were against the big comps that came out COVID, right? So when you think about growth as a percentage. And so, the underlying dynamic in the market and U.S. specific about the U.S. market, it’s pretty strong. March was the best month of the quarter for us in new patient growth than the U.S. market. And so we think that that trend is going to continue. And we're very hopeful about vaccine rollouts. We'll start to open up diagnostics. And of course, we have the new product that will come out in the calendar year. So we feel very confident about the underlying cores, the business continuing to grow over the coming quarters. And then we'll be able to not just maintain share, but probably take some share. But there's obviously some uncertainty associated with COVID, and some other things where we feel very confident for underlying growth dynamic, and it's the COVID comp that has to clear for us to be able to talk about double digit growth.
Margaret Kaczor: Okay. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Matthew Mishan with Keybanc. Your line is open.
Matthew Mishan: Great. Hello, Mick, thanks for the questions. I listened to the HCA calls, which is a theater [ph] large hospital system in the U.S. They seem to be integrating in hospice and home health into their systems at this point. And you've seen like Cerner not really want to follow up the hospital customers down. How can you work with large hospital systems as they migrate down into your victim to scale?
Mick Farrell: Matt, it’s a great question, and it talks to within our software as a service business, obviously, we have privacy, we have cyber security, but then we have interoperability. And interoperability making sure our data can through secure Private API's be able to interact with hospital care systems, is an incredibly important part of the system. We call an out-of-hospital healthcare, because we don't believe you have to go to hospital to get good health care, but the hospital systems call it post acute care. And that link between post acute care and out-of-hospital care has to be very secure and has to be very seamless, if you like for the patient and for the healthcare system. We're now many quarters into our Cerner partnership and what we've shown in that to our partner there, Cerner is that ResMed is a great recipient of patient from the hospital system into both home health and hospice and beyond now into infusion with that partnership. And I think we've got a sort of a track record, that ResMed can take care of those patients and make sure that there's a seamless transition from hospital to the out-of-hospital healthcare network. And so, with that proven track record, I look to their customers, those sort of Cerner, Epic and Allscripts, their customers being HCA and others, as HCA sort of broadens their holistic care if you like, our patients from hospital to the home, that's an opportunity for those providers to partner with someone like ResMed. So there's the seamless transfer of the patients. Look, the ultimate goal is that we take costs out of the system. We take care of the patient better. And we have seamless transfer from hospital to home or out-of-hospital care. And then hopefully not but if you do go back to the hospital, that record can move back and forwards very well. We've got a good track record of it. And I actually see a lot of upside, as hospital systems think holistically in that sort of ACO sort of Accountable Care Organization approach. And we've got a lot of experience in Western Europe, in patients taking care of holistically throughout Northern Europe and beyond. So I'm confident that we will do well in this evolution of sort of an acute care system or sick care system to a true healthcare system and a preventative health care system, which is where ResMed best 90 plus percent of our revenues and profits, and really with the SAAS business, it's where we are the only strategic with the capability to scale not just across the U.S., but globally.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Your line is open.
Mike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the AirSense 11. Is there anything more you can tell us about that product and how it compares to AirSense 10. And then, historically, when you've launched new for generic platforms, it has had a fairly sizable impact on your growth, at least on the device side. So is there any reason to believe that that won't happen with this? And then, similar question on the cost. Is this going to be a higher, I guess a lower cost of manufacturing slash higher gross margin product? What just ramps up, obviously? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes, Thanks, Mike. Great question with three great parts to it. So the first part, the AirSense 11 is out there. It's in control product launch. As I said, in the prepared remarks, I'm personally part of that CPL. And just amazing benefits for the individual patient and the bed partner in terms of how quiet comfortable cloud connected and capabilities. So the features are extraordinary. One thing, we've opened up to the most we ever have around the pipeline that is out there, because there's a public regulatory documents out there, and it's in CPL. I don't want to go through all the features and functions other than to say that, but it's smaller, it's quieter, it's more comfortable, it's more cloud connected. And it's not just the device, it's the software system that goes with it that provides a value for not just the patient, but the physician, the provider, and the healthcare system that are part of it. So, to the second part in question around growth, yes, look, I do think this will be a catalyst for growth. That’s why I'm comfortable in the prepbox [ph]. And you answered to Gretel earlier to talk about our comfort in saying, we're going to push towards double digit growth for the back end of this fiscal year that we're in here. And I think this device will be a catalyst for it. I think the software, the digital health technology software around it will be a large part of that catalyst for growth. Obviously, we're a different business than, when I was running the Sleaford, we launched the S9. It was, I think the total revenues of the company were less than a billion dollars. And now the total revenues are over $3 billion, trailing 12 months. And so, the percentage growth, the numbers won't be as impressive as 10 years ago, but the growth in terms of net revenue and profitability, we can reinvest in the business for more devices and less software will certainly be there. The third party question around cost. Clearly our goal, every generation is to create smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more clever devices and software systems, but also ones that have better efficiency. So we lower cost of manufacturing low cost to our supply chain. So clearly, that's an important part of this platform. We expect to do that, as he said, as we scale that up across our global business.
Mike Matson: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much. Mick, we are all aware that Philips had the issue with their devices. Just wondering what your expectations are? One, if we can clarify whether there's any risks that ResMed has the same issue with ozone cleaning? And then secondly, what the implications might be for ResMed position in the market?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Thanks, David. And we clearly saw from the earnings call from our competitors, some issues that they're having with product quality. And I never comment on details of that. And I think all of us care most of all about our patients. And so, Rob, you want to talk a little bit to our quality standards and what we're working on as we look at that issue?
Rob Douglas: Sure. Yes, David, as Mick said, patient Safety is our number one priority, and we really focus on that. And we've actually paid a lot of attention to the timing devices over the years. And I can confidently say, we actually don't have this problem that has been reported by competitors. We have a different design using different materials. And we have a very solid test, aggressive testing procedure looking at this. We have a very sophisticated complaint tracking system, and across our 40 million installed base, we -- this is just not there at all. So we're extremely confident with that. We do -- we will always continue to pay close attention to patient safety and keep on it. The issue of ozone cleaning is an issue there. And we have communicated regarding our warranty position on that. It's an effective disinfectant, but the amount of use is important to keep a close eye on. So we've publicly put out information on that. And you can find that on our website, if you're interested in that. So, but we'll keep a close, very close eye on this as we would with any industry safety issue.
David Low: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks. David, actually does the second part of your question talks about what would be the implications in the market? I mean, clearly, I don't know if Jim Hollings wants to talk to this. But look, we want to take share when our products are smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better. And we've been doing that for three decades. But clearly, they might be some share implications if a competitor has constraints around supply. Jim, do you want to talk a little bit to that?
James Hollings: Sure. I think we're waiting to see what will happen with our competitors position and their ability to deliver product, but we're obviously always ready, willing and able to help our customers and more product. And to whatever extent there's potential upside for us and market share gains during the next quarter or two, and that we'll certainly do our best to take advantage of it.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman: Thank you. And good morning, Mick. Good morning, everybody. Mick, even just in broad brushstrokes to answer this question. We've seen, I guess, one of the better term the finale of competitive bidding, and it shape many, in its proposed shaped many months ago. I'm wondering if that's had any influence or what influenced that might have had with respect to pricing since that point in time?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. That's a great question. And I'll hand back to James Hollings to talk about whether the elimination of competitive bidding pretty much in terms of delight in 2024 has any implications for pricing with us without the U.S. customers. Jim, do you want to take that?
James Hollings: Yes, sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Competitive bidding being cancelled led to ongoing stability in the pricing in the U.S. market, and that's what we see. There's instability in pricing throughout the period, because there's stability of reimbursement. And we -- but far, we haven't seen any signals from CMS that they intend to relaunch a program. So it's a weird way to answer the question, but the non event lesson a little changes, we've just seen price instability.
Sean Laaman: Great. Thanks. Awesome. Appreciate the answer.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Sean.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Andrew Goodsall with MST Macquarie. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'm just going to touch back on your SAAS business. I know a few questions on this particular MatrixCare. But just trying to think in practical terms, how quickly we can sort of see that come back to certainly a lot of commentary in the marketplace that there's a big swing on the back of COVID to home delivery care in the home. So yes, just trying to sort of think just over the next sort of quarter how you're seeing the profile, that recovery?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Andrew, thanks. It's a great question. And there are so many dynamics of hospital care and in the flow out through post acute care to our SAAS system. I think, as we look forward, we saw 5% growth in the quarter across our SAAS business. We think the weighted average market growth across those seven or now eight verticals that we're in with Citus joining the portfolio, and specialty pharmacy and home infusion. We think that sort of mid single digit growth can move towards high single digit growth as we see patients get back to the hospital and therefore get back to the discharged to skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, and beyond. And so, it's difficult to say the exact rate of increase, but it's going to increase. And I think our technology and what we've invested in, particularly, even during COVID, some of the software that we put for our skilled nursing facility customers to manage patients who may or may not be infected by COVID, and how they operate their businesses have been very well received. So even as case rates declined, but COVID is still here, and it is still across, even with vaccinations going up, still going to impact those customers. I think some of those tools will help us see a faster path to getting from that mid single digit growth to high single digit growth across the group. And as I said in the prep remarks, and this is true for ResMed always. We don't just want to meet market growth, we want to beat that market growth. So, as I look towards our long term strategy and 2025, we've got the opportunity for to get way back to double digit growth in our SAAS business. But in the short to medium term, I think we can move from mid single digits to high single digits in this part of our portfolio. We've made the investments in the technology. We've made the investments for the customers to help them deal with the dynamics of code. And as recovery happens, we will be a partner for them for growth on the other side.
Andrew Goodsall: That's great. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: We have our next question coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Suraj Kalia: Hi, Mick. Brett, can you hear me, Alright?
Mick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Suraj. Perfect.
Suraj Kalia: So, Mick, couple of questions. And I'll just kind of put them together. Mick, I'm not sure I heard about the EHR 2 report. Would love to get you a perspective from a counter messaging perspective and any quantification of impact? And the second part of my question, Mick, if I could, the SAAS business, there was a period of time that it was a tailwind to margins to top line growth. And just kind of looking at it over the last, let's say, four or so quarters, it seems to be becoming a drag for the overall growth, some of these COVID issues notwithstanding, maybe you can just kind of parse this through the structural dynamics of returning this line item to what you would have perceived as normalized growth? Thank you for taking my questions.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Dave on AHRQ. And then I'll take the second one on SAAS.
David Pendarvis: Yes. Thanks, Suraj. And I'll give you this kind of a brief response here. If you want any more details, feel free to reach out to Amy, and she can bring you up to speed. But basically, AHRQ, we believe is taking a very narrow perspective on looking at the clinical literature, looking at only randomized controlled trials done under certain very careful criteria. And while traditionally, that has been the hallmark of the gold standard of trials, we think, particularly in this industry, where you've got a massive amount of real world evidence and a lot of other longitudinal trials that clearly demonstrate a benefits in terms of longevity, benefits in terms of clinically significant cardiovascular outcomes, also quality of life outcomes, and also outcomes in terms of healthcare utilization, lower costs, all of that evidence ought to be used to come to a conclusion that treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy is not only good for patients, but good for the healthcare systems, and good for economies as a whole. So, we're hopeful that all that evidence that we've brought in, and it's not just us, other societies, many of the clinical societies have come out. And there's been a vigorous sort of a cross industry wide cross clinical, academic, keeping leaders have all come out in the same direction. So we're hopeful that will be taken into account. And the final report, which we don't know when it'll be even likely, perhaps later this calendar year, we'll include that data and come to a better conclusion.
Mick Farrell: So Suraj, the only thing I'd add to Dave's response, which is very thorough, is that actually there are RCTs randomized control trials but also are excellent that weren't included. So if you're just looking at RCTs, even, you need to include some of those RCTs, which were in fact very positive. And the AHRQ just looked at some neutral RCTs and said, well, neutral that means no benefit. There's all these other proponents of evidence real world and RCTs that are positive. So, it was an interesting some section of the literature that they used. And we have lots of folks ask at academics working on that. On a second party question, SAAS, if you look at, it actually was a strong tailwind for us in this quarter, 5% growth versus the COVID included core part of the business. And I think it can be. As we look forward, and I spoke to this earlier in my answer to Andrew, about SAAS, going from mid single digits to high single digits, I think it can -- and then after meeting or beating that, so getting to double digit growth, in the SAAS part of our business, I do think that will become a tailwind for us that 12% of our revenue. So for the SAAS, as we get out of, the COVID, sort of slowdown of census rates in this out-of-hospital care, we get back to a normal flow of patients through. Because people are wanting to age in place, people are wanting to be outside the hospital. COVID just increase. The probability that people do not want to be in a hospital for any longer than they need to. And so I think the geographic and socio economic trends of a growing community and people wanting to age in place in an aging population, and the fact that people are seeing lower cost, lower acuity and better healthcare delivered outside the hospital all lead towards this. The dynamics of how quickly we go from mid single digit growth to high single digit growth, we can divide. But the fact is, it's going to go there, because people are moving from the hospital to out-of-hospital healthcare. And that's where we're investing. So, as I look forward to our long term strategy 2025, I am very confident that this will be a very strong tailwind to our business. The recovery of our whole business post COVID is what we're talking about here. But I look on the end of the FY 2022, strong double digit growth across our business. And I mean that across our whole business. Thanks for the questions, Suraj.
Operator: We have our last question coming from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks. Maybe just to follow up on the SAAS business and kind of going between Brightree and, and Matrix here. On the Brightree side, there was some consolidation in HME space through 2020. And just wonder if that is cycling through the numbers there. And in sort of how that plays out. But when sort of when we think of course, lead trends, if you could provide maybe a quick update on sleep labs in particular, I know, it's a small portion of the overall business. But it sounds like there could be a reversal in activity as folks actually get back to sleep labs. So just sort of an update on sleep labs? Thanks a lot.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the questions. Anthony. To your first part of question around SAAS. Yes, I mean, clearly there's consolidation of some plays in the HME industry, and that can impact our contracts with those. In general SAAS is per user per month, like per activating user per month approach. And so, acquisitions are -- HME acquiring another HME that doesn't currently use Brightree. Is actually upside for us, because usually, the acquiring entity has all the efficiencies and scale and capabilities, because they using Brightree, and then they put that into the acquired account. And so therefore, actually increased the number of users and the per user per month revenue for ResMed can be upside on that. If it's a Brightree user acquiring another Brightree user, well, then there can be some reduction, they might get some efficiencies and reductions of the number of chairs. But ultimately, if it's a smart customer it’s going to continue to grow. And so then that over time, as they grow will increase our revenues as part of that. So a lot of dynamics around the M&A there. But in general, in the long run for us, it's about us betting on the winning and efficient ATMs and Brightree helps us do that. Because the people who adopt Brightree other winners, they have the lowest costs and the best outcomes for their patients. So the second part of your question around sleep labs, I look over capacity here in the U.S., and the reduction that happens during COVID or in lab tests, those people scale their digital health solutions in their home sleep testing capability. So as they come back and open up the in-lab facilities, I think that will absolutely have a rebound of the capacity in the in-labs, but they won't lose what they gained in home sleep testing. As Aristotle said, when the mind is stretched by a new idea, it never returns to its original size. So they're not going to forget about these great digital health solutions that have the home sleep testing. So yes, we'll get the capacity back in the sleep lab. But I also think the scalable opportunity for those sleep diagnostics providers to provide low cost, customer friendly diagnostics and the home will be just a part of their portfolio and hopefully, will improve the rate of diagnosing the 936 million people worldwide. But we're just looking at the U.S., the 70 million people in this country that have mild, severe obstructive sleep apnea that need to be taken care of. Thanks for the question, Anthony. And I'll hand back to you, Amy to close up the call.
Amy Wakeham: Thanks, Mick. Did you want to give your closing remarks?
Mick Farrell: Sure. Yes. But I know we're nine minutes over. So I'll make this brief. Thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd like to thanks once again, the 7,500 ResMedians, many of you, shareholders, thank you for your hard work, dedication, helping people sleep better, breathe better, around 140 countries worldwide. Thank you for the many 1000s of enlightens. You're getting right now to our team in India. So that we can take care of people in this another emergency. I look forward to talking to you and to all of our shareholders here again in 90 days. Thanks.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your time. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out directly. This does conclude our call. Salini, you may now close out the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's third quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-01-28 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2021 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shentel, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Shentel. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. And several other members of management will be available during the Q&A following our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Amy. And thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us on today's call. On this our first call for calendar year 2021. We are happy to see the steady growth of production, distribution and availability of vaccines around the world. Clearly, we all want to see faster production and wider distribution so that people can be safe from COVID-19 and free to open up their communities and free to get back to their lives. We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians as well as providers, patients and Resmedian around the 140 plus countries that we operate in. In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma are steadily increasing, modestly improving on the trends we saw in the September 2020 quarter. We're seeing this improvement of patient flow even as second and third waves come through northern winter hemisphere nations, because physicians and providers are adopting digital health, which enables patient engagement, even when people cannot or do not want to meet live and in person. In my remarks today, I will provide a high-level overview of our December Q2, FY21 business results and then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on the financials. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities. Today, we have published and reported solid, high single digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results once again speak to our ResMed team's ability to work innovatively and deliver results, even when facing lower patient activity and little to no incremental benefit from ventilator sales. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders. We have also grown research and development investments in digital health technology as well as hardware, software and clinical research. We forecast increasing digital health demand from patients from physicians from providers and from healthcare systems as they embrace remote patient monitoring, and they adopt data driven population health management systems. We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers with an industry leading IP portfolio including over 6,000 patents and designs. Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences. And to drive lower health care system costs. We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based air solutions platform. We have sold over 13.5 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed. And we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud. With these data liberated to the cloud, we can unlock value for all of our customer groups. We can unlock value for patients through Maya, we can unlock value for physicians through AirView, and we can unlock value for IDNs payer providers as well as private and government insurance for data driven population health management. That's the future of healthcare. The goals we share with all of our customer are these three. One to improve patient outcomes, patient quality of life, patient chronic disease outcomes. Two, to lower overall healthcare system costs, and three to bend the curve of chronic disease progression. To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look at here at ResMed are of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type two diabetes with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond. During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID has continued to accelerate the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world. We are seeing the recognition of the value of Remote Patient screen, virtual diagnoses, Remote Patient Management, and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models in many of the nations that we serve patients. As an example of just one of these Germany during the quarter, approved reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices including our digital 3D printed dental sleep apnea product called NARVAL. This is the first time Germany has approved such a product type to treat sleep apnea. In addition, several German states looking at experimenting with digital Health Reimbursement models. These are exciting developments and we expect this will benefit our German business over time. We've also seen other national governments including France, Japan, and the United States, where they've adopted models and taken action to accelerate digital health adoption. Remote healthcare is of incredible importance during this COVID-19 pandemic. But digital health is also valuable well beyond the impact of COVID because it provides better availability of healthcare. It provides excellent quality care for patients, and it provides significantly lower costs for healthcare systems worldwide. These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy. We believe the accelerated adoption of digital Health Solutions represents a significant and permanent shift of the adoption curve for ResMed market leading digital health solutions. Let me now briefly update you on our top three strategic priorities. These three priorities are one to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses. Two, to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions. And three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital, and especially in the home. In our core market of sleep apnea, we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends, as well as very strong resupply activity, both of which has supported another quarter of solid revenue growth that you can see in the numbers we just released. Within 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States. And to take an example of a European country in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90 plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow. Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70 plus percent 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market. Obviously, the recovery rates of new patients starting sleep apnea therapy may be impacted by the typical seasonality we see in our largest market here in the United States in the March quarter. As a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of the calendar year this is as per normal. This seasonal impact affects devices more than it affects mask systems, given the relative price points of the two categories, and the fact that the vast majority of mask revenue is returning customers on resupply programs. The resiliency of our mask and accessory resupply has been strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And we see it as remaining strong through the recovery and strong in a post-COVID Peak world. We continue to produce clinical research showing that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea saves money and improves quality of life for patients. This quarter, we are now showing data that treating sleep apnea is actually a life and death decision. The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study. The high-level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life. It also showed the commerce side in that not trading sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher healthcare costs, treating those diseases and ultimately leading to early death. Let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve COPD, and asthma patients worldwide. Our goal is to reach more patients in our core Respiratory Care markets, including non-invasive ventilation, as well as life support ventilation, as well as newer areas including pharmaceutical, drug delivery, and high-flow therapy. We make the smallest quietest and most comfortable devices on the market. And they are all 100% Cloud connectable. We continue to see rapid adoption of the AirView for ventilation software solution that we launched in Europe in the midst of the peak of the COVID-19 crisis there about nine months ago; we accelerated the time to market to meet the needs of physicians and patients during the COVID peak. And it's proved to be very useful during the peak and beyond the peak. The value being provided for this platform has helped healthcare systems in the markets they operate in, where we ensure we are making digital health part of the standard of care for Respiratory Care, not just in Europe, but worldwide. During the quarter we decided to exit the portable oxygen market and shut down our concentrator business in that category. We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with stage two and stage three COPD patients. Since then, and these last five years we have acquired Propeller giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including stage one and stage two COPD patients. Additionally, and especially during COVID, we've seen more rapid adoption of high flow therapy that can support some COPD patients. And of course, we have our core, non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions for more severe COPD patients in markets globally already. In short, we don't need POC to help in our end-to-end digital health pathway for COPD. Additionally, given no positive changes to POC reimbursement in the latest round from the US government, and the economics of our customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value, the POC market itself is not as attractive as it was five years ago. The bottom line is this; we have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in stage one and stage two COPD. We have the emergence of high-flow therapy for stage two and stage three COPD. And we have growing use of non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in stage three and stage four COPD. So in summary, we are very well positioned to help patients, physicians, providers and payers with an end-to-end digital health management pathway for COPD. Let me now review our software as a service business. During the quarter our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our Brightree HME resupply solutions. Impact of COVID on surgical procedures and other in hospital and out of hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice. On the other hand, the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well even stronger. So as we look across our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health and hospice, life plan communities, private duty home care and senior living, we expect that the weighted average market growth rate of these verticals will be in the low to mid single digit range for fiscal 2021. We expect this weighted average market growth rate portfolio to return to mid-single digits and then to high single digits. As hospital discharge and ambulatory surgery center discharge rates return. Our offerings are very well received in each of the verticals that we serve. So we will not just accept these market growth rates, we will look to meet and beat that group market growth rate as we did this quarter, getting a return from our significant investments in R&D within Brightree and MatrixCare. And through expansion of our partnerships with hospital based electronic health record providers. Brightree continues to innovate to drive resupply growth. Of particular note the integration and scaling of the Snap Technologies is going very well. This has allowed our home medical equipment customers to expand their resupply programs and support more patients with better engagement at a time during the COVID pandemic when they desperately need new innovation both the providers and the patients. MatrixCare has also introduced new technology; we introduce new voice to text technology at the point of care, which helps address caregiver shortages which are right during COVID by enabling better and more efficient workflows for the customer, while also delivering a better experience for the ultimate customer who's the patient. Our expanded relationship with Cerner is progressing very well. We are now Cerner's preferred solution across home health and hospice, as well as her medical equipment and their pharmacy and infusion businesses. Our increasingly important relationship with Cerner is leading to better interoperability for providers and mutual customers and an improved experience for patients. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to sleep apnea and COPD disease management. Clearly, 2020 was an unprecedented year for companies across every industry, and there was much suffering around the world. However, we see some blessings during all that suffering. Importantly, we hear it resonated we were able to be there during the emergency. We were able to pivot our whole team and our home business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the endemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model. Additionally, COVID has highlighted the importance of respiratory health. COVID generally kills people through acute respiratory distress syndrome and awful but that has raised the awareness of respiratory hygiene, respiratory health and the field of respiratory medicine. The crisis also showed us the importance of digital health, and has accelerated the awareness and adoption of technologies that can be used for remote patient screening for remote patient diagnosis, Remote Patient setup, as well as remote patient monitoring and management. We have seen this crisis drive the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. And that's where ResMed competes to more than 90% of our business. And it's where we add value to customers and where we win. We have seen an ability to bring digital technology that we've been inventing and developing for over a decade, digital screening, digital diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and digital health management of patients. With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies. We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development, as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond. Before I hand the coal over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians whose perseverance, hard work and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances for 2020 allowed our partners in healthcare to save the lives of many hundreds of 1000s of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation, literally giving the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID. I also thank you for the rapid pivot back to our core markets and our core purpose of helping people with sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and all those who need world class care delivered well away from the hospital, and preferably in their own time. Thank you. With that I will hand the call over to Brett in Sydney and then we'll move to Q&A. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Right. Thanks Nick. Norman. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2021. And some remarks on our FY21 second half outlook. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior quarter. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Total revenue for the December quarter was $800 million, an increase of 9% than the prior quarter, and in constant currency terms revenue increased by 7%. Consistent with our predictions in Q1 earnings call, we derive minimal incremental revenue from COVID-19 related demand in the December quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were $427 million, an increase of 5%. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $291 million; increases of 17% were in constant currency terms and increase of 10%. By product segment, US, Canada and Latin America device sales were $205 million, an increase in 1%. Masks and others sales were $222 million, an increase of 8%. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales total $188 million, an increase of 16%. When in constant currency terms a 10% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $93 million, an increase 18% when in constant currency terms and increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency term, device sales increased by 5%, while mask and other sales increased by 9%. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6%. On non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 5%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment that makes it clear deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 20 basis points to 59.9% in the December quarter compared to 59.7% in the same quarter last. The increase is predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product exchanges and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $169 million, a decrease of 1%. On a constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 3%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.2% compared to the 23.3% recorded in the prior quarter. Benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Looking forward with SG&A expenses in the second half of FY21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 10% or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to 6.8% in the prior year. We continue to provide for further investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology, product and solution development will deliver sustained and competitive advantage. Looking forward we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in a high single digit reflecting this commitment to innovation. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $19 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $15 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $254 million, an increase of 16% reflecting strong top-line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well contained operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.8%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $206 million, an increase of 17%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.41, also a 17% increase. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23. During the December quarter, we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business. We recognized that restructuring expenses of $13.9 million associated with the closure. Going forward the cessation of the POC business will have an immaterial impact on both group revenue and earnings per share. We did not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future. And we have adjusted for this one-time expense within our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $170 million reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $35 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter total $41 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.6 in our income statement in the December quarter associated with Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $5million per quarter in the second half of FY21 associated with the joint venture operation. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $256 million. At December 31, we had $826 million in gross debt and $570 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. At December 31, we had a further $1.4 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Our total cash flow and liquidity provides flexibility in how we allocate capital. We've focused on paying down debt as well as ensuring we have cash reserves to support the company through the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest to grow through R&D. We will also likely deploy capital for tuck-in acquisitions such as Snap which we completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. We intend to continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend program and we might also resume our share buyback program some time during the calendar year. This program has been on par since our acquisition of MatrixCare and Propeller Health in fiscal 2019. Turning now to our FY21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a negligible COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in the second half of FY21.Q2. Note as a reminder we recorded $35 million in COVID generated ventilator revenue in our March quarter last year. And $125 million COVID generated ventilator revenue in our June quarter last year. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 12 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base and the success of our resupply service offering. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask sales in the second half of FY21. Notwithstanding continued COVID-19 challenges, we continue to expect the sequential increase in new sleep patients that should support our devices as we move through the second half of FY21. However, we typically experienced a small seasonal sequential decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3, largely attributable to reset of deductibles and health insurance plans in our US market. We expect this trend will also be apparent in FY21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment, including the potential disruptive impacts of ongoing restrictions imposed in many of the countries we operate in. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I'll hand call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great, thank you, Brett. And thank you, Mick. Shentel, let's now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.
MargaretKaczor: Hey, good afternoon, and good morning to you, Mick. Thanks for taking the questions. And maybe the first one for me as to hit it off. You guys mentioned that there were negligible vent sales this quarter. So does that imply that this is a good revenue base for our model to grow off of for that coarsely business? And the reason I ask is, if it does, and then sales went from $40 million last quarter, none this quarter actually does imply that the business is doing quite well. So any details would be great. Thanks Mick.
MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, clearly in the December quarter, we had as we predicted sort of the minimis ventilator sales a little bit in Northern Europe, perhaps, but not material across the group. And as Brett said in the remarks just now from him, and I said as well, we expect no sort of COVID related than later sales throughout the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. People have enough in the hospitals, which is great. And so yes, look, it does start to form a good a good base, when you look at the core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow. I mean, as we said, the seasonality, usually from Q2, December quarter to Q3 March quarter relating to the US market and deductibles, and so on. But for the other 139 countries we're in and across the portfolio, so it's a good base to start to, to get that slow and steady improvement in the patient flow in this new digital health driven world, Margaret. Our patients going to primary care on zoom and telemedicine and getting referrals to their specialists and coming through the pipeline. And so we think it's better for the long term, but it is slowly and steadily coming back from advice. And yes, as we said, sort of in those numbers of the percentage flow patients as best we can see it. We saw improvement from September to December. And so those in takings up vent sales over that 90-day period as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie.
DavidBailey: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Mick and Brett. I'm just interested in actually what you've seen adherence levels over COVID-19, whether you've seen it pick up over the last sort of calendar year? And an extension of that any sort of relationship that you've been able to gather from in between resupply and adherence level? Any comments there would be interesting.
MickFarrell: Yes, it's interesting. And we certainly think sort of modest, sort of single digit improvements in overall adherence, as we look at the big data, and we're actually doing a whole bunch of research on this to understand the sort of kinetics and dynamics of COVID-19 on the market. I think really early stage instead of March, April, people, there was a lot of things going around, and maybe using a CPAP would bring more virus in the room if you have other people room. So some fear and uncertainty and doubt in that early period. But I think that was all covered over by doctors saying listen, if you get treated for sleep apnea, it's actually preventative and improving your lungs and lower impact and severity of COVID-19. And again, look, there's so much clinical literature out there in terms of the general press, but through the scientific data, we are able to see people are adhering, those who are adhering more and sleeping more and using the devices more. And David, to your point, they're participating more in those resupply programs; they are seeing the importance of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. And when they get a text response, or an app click and a chance to say yes, I want that new mask, I want that new tubing, I want that new humidifier, they putting it at much higher rates and getting closer to, frankly, what they should have always done, which is keeping respiratory hygiene at top of mind. So I would say modest improvements in overall adherence and more significant improvements in the probability that a person says, who is adherent says, I want to get that mask with that copay. I want to get that mask now to get resupply and in cash markets, same thing as well. So it's a really good question, David. It's a complex equation. We're working through all the variables, but yes, modest improvement in adherence and really good improvement in mask resupply as you saw in the numbers, as well as you saw in the health of the patients.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America.
LyanneHarrison: Good morning and congrats. Just a question. I'm trying to understand the change in these charts, I guess the recovery rate to create a few key markets do not appear to have yet improved much compared to the rates you quoted at the last result call. Can you give us some color on what you're hearing in relation to the pipeline in particular physicians' access in sleep testing, whether it being in the level at home to our key markets particularly as COVID cases staged in November and December?
MickFarrell: Lyanne, it's a good question. And like David's, it's complex, because there's 140 countries all adopting digital health at different rates, and all having different sort of national rules around retail and restaurants as well as how you get back to life and back to health care as well. Healthcare has proved pretty resilient, I think, because people know, it's an essential industry. And the data that I shared earlier around truly life and death decision of using your CPAP or not for treating sleep apnea. I mean, it's incredible to have those data in the hands of our physicians worldwide as they are driving adherence. It's one thing to be doing a digital telemedicine call with a patient over a zoom or secure network, it's another one to say, listen, using this device will save your life, as well as improve your quality of life. And so the numbers of plus or minus 10% anyway, and that's why the ranges are so broad. But look, here the US key market is somewhere between 70 to 90% of pre-COVID patient flow as best we can measure it by at the link air usage by essence 10 sort of air solutions, activations of new devices and reactivations of resupply devices. And it's not perfect data. And it's different in all the 50 states just in the country that I'm living in here, between California, Massachusetts, and Florida, very different areas of opening up of their whole economies on local and state regulation. But that range is pretty broad, but it's pretty accurate in terms of the patient flow through. And that's why I think you've seen people really participating in masks and accessory resupply programs, but a slowdown, obviously a new patient starts. And as you pointed out the kinetics of it. Yes, true from the September quarter, I think we moved up sort of somewhere between 5% and 10% in each of the key markets, I talked about US, China and Germany as examples for Americas, Europe and Asia. So that's 5%, 10% 500 basis points, plus improvement in the quarter it's not this V shape, we're back to 100%, December 2019. Again, but it's a slow, steady sort of U-shaped improvement in the flow of patients, which we think does then over time flow through with all the systems and all the restrictions and portfolio of 140 countries through to patients getting set up and started on a lifetime of therapy on sleep apnea or COPD therapy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS.
SaulHadassin: Good afternoon, Mick. Good morning, Brett. And say good afternoon Amy as well. Just a quick question on rest of the world sales, Mick, ex-US sales. So strong growth rates, both the costs for generators and masks, just wondering if you can give a bit more color, if sleep therapies are still sort of recovering back to you said 85% - 90% in some regions, just what else drove that very strong growth rate across those two product categories? And was there any tender timing for example, in Asia Pac that may be contributed to that strong growth rate?
MickFarrell: Thank you, thanks for the question. So I'll have a little bit of a go at it. And then hand to Rob Douglas, our COO beside me here to provide more detail. Look as I said, there was some modest sales of ventilators in western and northern Europe during the quarter that'll flow into the devices number at plus 10% constant currency, and then the masks at plus 12% constant currency. Again, this is Europe, Asia, and the whole entire rest of worlds, and so we're talking 135 plus countries. And so, Rob, do you want to have a go at summarizing that is for sale singly.
RobDouglas: Yes, let's just cross off the last point, Saul, I saw that there wasn't any kind of changes or issues in any of those markets, particularly. But across the board it was really interesting. We sort of had strong performance in many, many countries. Usually the countries are wary and some are strong and some aren't so on a given time, but it looked like there was pretty good strong performance. And we think the same underlying fundamentals that we've talked about, particularly in the US market. We're applying at different scales on these markets. And so in many small markets, we saw the uptake of that digital solutions being really strong. And in fact that underpinning that in our own technology base. In fact, actually a really good performance for that. Our technology team is meeting those digital requirements in each of the different countries as well. And then it was just really sort of patient demand for making sure their treatment is up to scratch. Really good, and we saw that dynamics across the board. The whole issue of the resurgence didn't seem to have quite effected that you might have thought because I think the health systems have learn that they actually didn't need to shut down everything in the health system and they knew what they can keep open. And so then the sort of the diagnosis processes and that kept going on. As Mick said before, things aren't yet back to fully open and normal. But the whole system's striving to get there. And additional things that have taken home sleep testing in some markets have been supportive as well. So it's really our whole suite of solutions is supporting a market that needs to treat these patients if it is going.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc.
MatthewMishan: Hey, great, and thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, just a quick one for me, just what is the pushback, what is the pushback from the payer community on closing the gap and reimbursement between at home sleep testing and lab-based tests?
MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. I think the payer community and it varies. Take the example of the United States where it's probably 25% government reimbursement and 75% if you like in our sleep PAP but seems like sleep apnea sales of private payers, they were very supportive of both in lab and in home with apnea testing. And if you look at this country pre-COVID was probably about 45% home sleep apnea testing versus 55% in lab. I think that's moved up very significantly during COVID. Obviously, during the peak of the lockdowns it went very high. And it will probably level out somewhere in that 50%, 55%, 60% range of the diagnoses being home sleep apnea testing. Plus often have deltas of anything you can vary from $250 for home sleep apnea test and $750 - $800 for in lab test, just relative to the cost over there. Obviously, for the payer they would want if it's clinically equivalent patient and good sensitivity, specificity of the data and good patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction as well the payers care about, they would flow towards home sleep apnea testing, where they can go. But look I'll hand over David Pendarvis to add any further color on that dynamic.
DavidPendarvis: Yes, Matt, at least in the US there actually are some pretty straightforward dollar investment and time requirements that go into reimbursement for a lot of payers. And the fact of the matter is, PHP equipments a lot more expensive to purchase, more expensive to operate, and it takes more time from both the physician and the facility. So that's what they're looking at more so than necessarily the incentives that are driven by the lower cost of home sleep testing. And the higher reimbursement rate of PSG. We certainly support good PSG when it's appropriate for the patient, and there's a lot of sleep labs that have invested a lot of capital, they invest a lot of time for their staff in that. And it's important that they be reimbursed adequately. So they both have their place in the market. But I think it's generally those sorts of things that go into their reimbursement decisions, not necessarily what outcomes are they trying to drive.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of MST Macquarie.
AndrewGoodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just looking at your margins, obviously, mask growth outpaced flow generated. So I can say it's a mixed effect. Could you sort of talk to that mix effect, but also expand on your comments on average selling price decline?
MickFarrell: Brett, let's see it.
BrettSandercock: Yes, thank you. Sure. Thanks Mick. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, I mean, we had if you look through the year-on-year 20 basis point expansion. So it was kind of a moderate expansion. So those moving parts that I talked about and those impacts are pretty much or pretty small overall. The mix, pretty much they kind of had that strong mask crisis it's going to underpin that product mix. If you look that, year-on-year little bit of benefit from some effects but pretty minor. And then on ASPs, again, it's I'd characterize a pretty benign environment from a pricing perspective, and that's probably reflected in that pretty small movements in the gross margin year-on-year.
AndrewGoodsall: So the ASPs are pretty modest but you flagged that and -
BrettSandercock: Yes, [Multiple Speakers] historic context. I think it's a pretty benign environment for us relative to historical trends.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley.
SeanLaaman: Thank you and good morning, Mick. I have a question on the exit of the PIC business. If I get this right, and I think I've got it simplistically right, but please correct me that you think you've got those mid stage COPD patients covered already through non-invasive events, and there's better reimbursement. And maybe there's a better clinical outcome. But we consider any sort of change in the thinking about how the funnel might operate to get to those patients and service and with non-invasive events with Propeller. Thanks Mick.
MickFarrell: Yes, Sean, it's a great question. And yes, you're right, look at what Propeller that acquisition is about 24 months old so that what that allowed us to do is to get to patients much earlier in the COPD development cycle. It's really stage one, COPD, where you have that shortness of breath, climbing a flight of stairs, and you go to see the primary care diagnosis and find out that you do have some lung dysfunction. And this broad category called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; you get put in that bucket. And there are many different types of therapies that the doctor can go to, but a lot of them are those pharmaceutical therapies up front. And those inhalers are not used as prescribed when they just given a prescription. The sign is when a pill is prescribed for high cholesterol or low blood pressure the adherence rates are very low in the general population 50% plus or minus. And with Propeller Health we are able to drive those adherence rates up double digits on a relative basis and drive to incredible adherence rates that the pharma industry just hasn't seen in respiratory medicine. And so Propeller technology is really exciting. It's really new. We have major global pharmaceutical companies partnering with us in major markets driving that. Early days but we think that allows us to get to stage one stage two patients in a very significant, scalable way to get them on that sort of end-to-end, digital health journey in COPD. As they progress to stage two, stage three, they sometimes get prescriptions for high-flow therapy, oxygen and ventilation, right. And so with it with non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, which is really stage three, stage four, and in that sort of crossover phase from the pharmaceuticals to the ventilator, both oxygen and high flow therapy used. High-flow therapy is newer and more scaling. And we think more related to our core business and the core devices we make. And it allows us to treat the patients and take care of the patients. And so PSC just became an additional one that wasn't as important in that end-to-end journey, and certainly didn't have the sort of margin profile or the growth profile with the changes in reimbursement to allow us to have the same growth opportunity that we have in non-invasive ventilation and life support ventilation. So that's sort of it in a nutshell.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse.
GretelJanu: Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about the future pricing environment in the US? I know you said it's the benign currently. But and of course, we did have the announcement of 2 key DMEs merging could you expect great ASP price declines going forward in this benign environment that you're currently in?
MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Gretel. I'll hand that to the President of our Global Sleep and Respiratory Care Business. Jim, over to you.
JamesHollings: Sorry, can you hear me now? It's a terrible way to enter the call. Thank you for the question. Thanks, Mick. I think that what we've seen this year is benign is maybe too softer word for price. But I'll go with benign. We've had a pretty stable pricing environment; I think in anticipation of - the market was anticipating the competitive bid rates. And then of course, competitive bid got delayed. And obviously, the Adapt Health acquisition of Arikare creates an even larger customer for us; they're very important customer for us. And we enjoy a very good relationship with them. I think both with that move. And then with ongoing trends into the year, we should see something that looks like more normal pricing environment, I think, in the second half of the fiscal year and going forward. And it'll be a little bit different by market as it always is, but I would expect it to be kind of back in a more normal trend.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan.
DavidLow: Thanks very much. Look, my question is on the software business, Mick, I think you commented that Brightree delivered most of the growth, MatrixCare et cetera, facing more of a challenge from the pandemic. Can you elaborate a little bit and how much growth did you see through Brightree? And what's driving that and I guess most importantly, can we maintain that growth in that part of the software business?
MickFarrell: Yes, thanks for the question. David, and clearly Brightree had strong growth driven by the strength of our home medical equipment, customers and their ability to pivot their businesses to mask and resupply, and the great adoption of Brightree resupply sort of our core resupply software there. But also the Snap Technologies acquisition that we closed almost exactly a year ago, we were doing due diligence a year ago and closed it sort of later on during this March quarter. And so those two technologies have been very well adopted. But look, in addition to that our Brightree team it's a significant double-digit percent of their revenues in R&D, they've delivered a whole bunch of innovation, some COVID related management opportunities for their HME customers, as well as other innovative ways to grow their business. And so that's allowed the Brightree business to support HMEs and really help them survive and thrive in the early stages, and later stages of COVID-19. And it's great help to the industry. And I'm really proud that ResMed and Brightree are able to deliver that. On the MatrixCare side, yes, it's a tougher story, because the verticals that they operate in will more severely affected skilled nursing facility, census was down high double digits the peak of the crisis and still is down year-on-year on the number of patients in skilled nursing facility operations, and that impacts MatrixCare census rights and ability to grow. In addition, hospice affected similarly, on the other hand home health has been a growth light within the MatrixCare area, and the addition of our MatrixCare branded, but it's healthcare first Brightree and MatrixCare technologies, all combined under the MatrixCare brand has been growing really well. And the Glen and his team who is the VP who's driving that has seen incredible growth in home health and hospice. And I think if you look across that portfolio, what sort of a guy that we deal with because it's you can go through all the verticals in detail is that we think that weighted average market growth rate is needed to have loading in single digits right now. You saw we grew 6% in the quarter. So we're growing a little bit ahead of market taking a little - some of those verticals. But as the weighted average market growth rate goes to mid-single digits, we're going to look to meet and do that. And then when it gets back to high single digits, as the flow of patients from hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, picks up, we will then see skilled nursing facilities, hospice and all the verticals, pick up their census rights and get us back to those sorts of growth rates and beyond the time. So, David, it's really sort of part related to the whole recovery of the economy, and that really related to the hospital what people are calling elective surgeries. And I think if you need a heart valve, or a new hip, it's hardly elective when the pain or the probability of death starts going up. And I think healthcare systems are really starting to address that and get their patients back into care. So we should start to see those recoveries over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Matson of Needham and Co.
MichaelMatson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted asked about the decision to exit the PSC market. You made some comments on that in the prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. I guess what I'm wondering is, was this really a marketing issue? Do you think that the markets just not attractive or the margins on the products too low relative to their other products? Was the product that you had to kind of start with just not competitive enough? Or were there other reasons for exiting this market? I guess what I'm getting at was this a product issue or market issue or both?
MickFarrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. Like I'll - I said, what I said in the prepared remarks and the question before, maybe I'll hand to Jim Hollings for any further detail. I mean we have the end-to-end play with all that we have in, our core capabilities of Propeller, high-flow therapy, non-invasive ventilation and lots of ventilation. But Jim any further detail you want to share from Mike.
JamesHollings: Yes. Thanks, Mick. And thanks Mike. I think Mike, and for balancing sort of market versus our portfolios the way I would frame it, I think it's a little bit of both. So if you look at the market, we've thought for a long time that POCs should be reimbursed in a better way than a differential way because they create a lot of value for patients, they allow patients to be mobile and to get out about which is actually better for the care. But especially in the US market reimbursements always been upside down sort of unfavorable to POCs versus stationary. And we enter the category knowing that and we're innovating and we actually feel really good about the product. We had been developing the product, we had a market and the next generation that we were developing, but then you see how reimbursement is not changed and in fact has become less favorable and in relative terms of categories are just not that attractive, right. It doesn't have the same growth that it had five years ago when we enter it as a category, and that sort of thing. And then when you take that line of business and compare it to our overall portfolio in the sleep and respiratory care business, in relative terms, it's not nearly as strong a profile as the other opportunities, we have to invest in innovation, right? So we have a fantastic opportunity to continue to invest in Propeller or health, a fantastic opportunity, it's early days, but a fantastic opportunity to invest in high-flow therapy, which we think has a really interesting clinical profile and could be of great benefit to patients. And then, of course, as we continue to grow our digital offerings, our R&D portfolio there is just plenty of places for us to put R&D into other digital offerings in the expansion of our digital offerings. And so there's both the question of looking at the market and where that category had evolved since we'd entered with that acquisition, but also just looking at the range of opportunities we have in hand and making a decision to invest in things that we think afford more attractive, both for ResMed shareholders and also for patients.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs.
ChrisCooper: Hi, morning and afternoon. Thank you. Most of my near 10 questions have been asked. So just given there's been lots of references to high-flow therapy, today, I guess it would be remiss of me not to just ask you guys for a bit more of a sort of comprehensive update on where you're positioned. And what your strategy is there. I mean, did you guys have what you need in terms of current portfolio or are there some areas that might make sense from sort of a tuck-in perspective? And just generally, I guess your views on market growth and how you fit within that over the quarters and years ahead. I mean the references you made today are indicative clearly of how increasingly important this therapy looks and embrace this therapy markets but that just been keen to get some sense of quantification from you that would be helpful, if that would be possible. Thank you.
MickFarrell: Thanks for your question, Chris. And look, it's a really exciting new area for us, obviously, with further down the road on Propeller Health and it's starting to move into stage one stage two area. During COVID-19, there were uses of high-flow therapy for patients with low oxygen and it's always been an area that has been looked at. We're interested in, ResMed's 90% of our revenues are in the home, we're really interested in home care, and the idea of high-flow therapy in the home we think has a lot of future. There's not a lot of reimbursement, in fact, virtually zero anywhere around the world. So it's a new development area. But we think, given some of the clinical data that are coming out, and some of the research we're doing with providers around the world, there is an opportunity to get patients out of the hospital and into the home with high-flow therapy treatment, and as a stepping stone on the pathway to our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators and in combination with our drug delivery system. So it's very early days, Chris, not at all material to our business, but it provides that sort of bridge portfolio, if you like, from Propeller through to the ventilation side, and we think was validated somewhat during COVID-19. And some clinical data that we are working with people with around the world says that as we look towards 2025, we think this will be a good part of our homecare portfolio of taking care of patients with high-flow therapy.
ChrisCooper: And just a very brief follow up, Mick. So for the homecare opportunity to really manifest in the way you expect do you need reimbursement to become more supportive? Or do you think that the current arrangements would allow that to happen?
MickFarrell: No, Chris, I think we'd want to see our reimbursement models developed because that's how change happens, right? I mean, it's both the Hippocratic Oath and Adam Smith, if you like that are required to move some areas of healthcare. We've seen that in digital health where we had amazing solutions for over a decade in the field of liberating data to the cloud and driving up adherence and so on. But it was when we started to see models in the US and France and Japan and now Germany, where digital health started to be reimbursed because it is providing care that is of value and then reflecting that for the doctors and the providers and reimbursing in that. So I think reimbursement is a very important part of developing the home care market for high-flow therapy. So obviously, our research and partnerships with payers, providers and IDNs will be along those lines.
Operator: Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer.
SurajKalia: Good afternoon. Can you hear me all right? Perfect. So Mick a couple of subpart questions related to COVID. Are you seeing any COVID related shifts in the mask replacement cycle now these transients are relatively stickier in nature, and if I could, has COVID identified any manufacturing, location re-optimization that would help you all realize incremental margin gains over the next few years? Thank you for taking my questions.
MickFarrell: Thanks, Suraj. I'll hand the first question to Jim around replacement rates around masks during COVID and stickiness of that beyond. And then the second part around global manufacturing to Rob Douglas. So Jim you first?
JamesHollings: Sure. Thanks, Mick thanks Suraj. On mask replacement, I think, what we've seen all year during the pandemic is a couple and we've talked about this, I think on this call, before we've seen a couple of dynamics. The first one is I do think patients are just more attentive to the idea that their equipment might be older, I think there's a greater sensitivity and awareness on behalf of patients to sort of have clean and disinfected reading apparatus, right? I mean, so I think that's driven a bit of incremental demand. And it's an open question as to how persistent and will be, but I would think it's going to be a bit more persistent. I think you'll see patients just more attentive to cleaning their masks and their tubes, and resupply and on a regular cadence. But that's speculation, and you certainly seen it this year. I don't know how long that will continue, or if it will increase and so on. I think the other thing that, of course, has been happening is in the markets where resupply is a benefit, which is largely the US market or other markets where it is for the provider, but the US market, I think HME customers have been, if anything more focused on driving the supply as a part of the business to patients. And so that's been a marriage of two trends where the HME wants to pay attention to the supply, as new patient starts have been slower, and the patient wants the equipment. And I think that behind that, in addition to behind that we've had increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms, including our offerings there. So I think all three of those trends have led to higher resupply overall. And I think it probably will persist, but it's very difficult to predict as all things COVID are.
RobDouglas: Yes, and Suraj to your question on the manufacturing impact, the whole issue around COVID been very challenging for supply chains, and freight trains, all over the world, for many, many companies. And I think like many companies, we are carefully looking at the resilience of our supply chain through there. There are other issues going on around politics and trade relationships that we've got to work. Some of these are going to be beneficial as you talk about margins and some of the headwinds. And I think as we continue to scale our business, we should be able to run faster than those headwinds over time.
Operator: We are now at the end of the scheduled time for the call. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Shentel. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on today's call. I'd like to once again take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, almost all of them are our shareholders for their dedication and hard work helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in over 140 countries. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines, production, distribution, tech service, customer service, talking to customers and delivering product every day. I look forward to talking with all of our stakeholders here again in 90 days. Thank you, Amy, over to you.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. And thank you all again for joining us today. I know we weren't able to get to all the questions in the queue. So please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly if you've got anything further. And as previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our website later today. Shentel, you may now go ahead and close out the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-10-29 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2021 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.
 I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin. 
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Hello, everyone, and welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us. As Cheryl said, this webcast -- this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and the quarterly results presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.
 On the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our CEO Mick Farrell and CFO Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion following our prepared remarks.
 During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.
 And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mick. 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. Since this COVID-19 pandemic began in January, ResMed has produced hundreds of thousands of ventilators, providing the gift of breath to people in need in 140 countries worldwide. We continue to support frontline respiratory medical professionals, health care providers, patients and our teammates, ResMedians, so they are all safe and healthy. We also continue to provide ventilators as local state and national health care providers are facing second and third waves of COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations. Thankfully, the magnitude of these hospitalization waves and thus, the need for emergency ventilators is decreasing over time.
 In our core markets, the patient diagnosis trends in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and beyond are steadily increasing as well as prescription therapy flow from those diagnoses. Growing numbers of people are returning to health care systems, including primary care as well as specialist care. We are seeing more health care systems come back online through telehealth and in-person visits. Overall treatment capacity as well as capacity utilization rates of those systems are both increasing. We have seen a steady sequential, what we would call U-shape recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians as well as then to specialist physicians across the 140 countries that we serve. This is just as we forecast 90 days ago on our Q4 earnings call. We expect this same patient flow growth trend to continue throughout fiscal year 2021.
 In my remarks today, I'll provide a high-level overview of our Q1 business results, and then I'll hand over to Brett to walk us through further detail. I will also review progress towards our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly as well as our annual operating priorities.
 Today, we have reported high single-digit growth in top line revenue and strong double-digit growth in both net operating profit as well as earnings per share. These results speak to our team's ability to nimbly pivot to meet short-term needs for emergency ventilators, while also investing for the long-term growth in our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital medical software.
 Our investments in research and development for digital health technology have accelerated these last 9 months as we see increasing demand from patients, physicians, providers as well as health care systems as they embrace digital health through remote patient engagement as well as population health management technology.
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we generated over $144 million of cash, allowing us to return $57 million of cash as dividends to our shareholders. At the same time, though, we have increased our research and development investments at double-digit rates, including investments in digital health clinical research as well as hardware and software innovation across both our med tech and our Software as a Service businesses. We have a very full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for customers with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs.
 Our digital health ecosystem is an important competitive advantage for ResMed that offers integrated care to drive superior clinical outcomes, to drive better patient experiences and to drive lower total health care system costs. We now have over 7 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. We've provided over 12.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices to customers, and we have over 14 million patients enrolled in our AirView software solution.
 During our last earnings call, I discussed how COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technology around the world, including a recognition of the value of remote patient monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the rapid evolution of digital reimbursement models. We have seen much greater collaboration between the med tech industry and governments globally, not just in ventilators but well beyond. An encouraging example of this was just a few days ago when the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or CMS announced that it will be maintaining current reimbursement rates in our product categories in January 2021. This is great news. And in part, it is due to industry feedback that it was inappropriate to make unnecessary changes, particularly during an ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency, and really importantly, that current rates were appropriate for the services being provided.
 We've also seen governments in Germany, France, Japan and across the U.S. adopt models to facilitate digital health and remote care that will be important, not only during this pandemic but well beyond. This is better health care at lower costs, leveraging technology. These trends support ResMed's 2025 strategy, and we believe that the accelerated adoption of digital health solutions represents a significant medium and long-term tailwind for our business.
 These 3 trends: one, the increased importance of respiratory medicine; two, the increased importance of digital health; and three, the increased importance of out-of-hospital health care, will all help ResMed meet and beat our goal of growing volume at double digits from 2020 through 2025 and improving over 250 million lives by 2025.
 Let me now highlight a few examples of innovation and execution in support of our strategic priorities. Just a recap of our strategy priorities: a, to grow and differentiate our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; b, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health solutions; and c, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered away from the hospital.
 In our core market of sleep apnea, we introduced our latest mask innovation in September. It's called the AirTouch N20. This innovation is the first nasal mask with a memory foam cushion. As a patient myself, I'm happy to say that this is ResMed's softest nasal mask ever. The memory foam technology of the AirTouch N20 adapts to the curves and contours of the person's face, creating a personalized fit that is designed to increase comfort and to make it easier for the patient to adhere to sleep apnea therapy. The adherence rates for ResMed solutions are the best in the industry. And it is innovation and technology like this new AirTouch N20 that helps get us there.
 Our mask portfolio is crafted to offer physicians market-leading options for prescribing for each patient. To enable home care providers to successfully fit the patient the first time every time and to satisfy the desires of the ultimate customer. That's the person who suffocates each night with sleep apnea. Our focus on innovation to meet customer needs will never end. We are innovating with smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent solutions every day. We have an exciting pipeline ahead.
 Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to deliver better care for COPD and asthma patients worldwide. During the June quarter, we launched in Europe an upgraded version of our AirView cloud-based remote monitoring software, specifically designed for our ventilation solutions. This solution called AirView for ventilation provides remote monitoring capability, allowing clinicians to quickly access clinical data from ResMed ventilation devices wherever they are and to allow them to more easily triage and prioritize both chronic needs and acute needs for ventilated patients. This completely reimagined platform transforms the management of ventilated patients, allowing doctors, nurses and all clinicians and care providers to ascertain powerful patient insights from huge respiratory medical data sets. Adoption of the AirView for ventilation solution has been rapid and strong.
 Our team was really thrilled to deliver for our customers during the COVID emergency with this solution, but the value that is being provided by AirView for ventilation is ongoing for physicians and health care systems. We are making digital health part of the standard of care. During the quarter, we expanded the reach of our market-leading Propeller Health technology, specifically through our partnership with pharmaceutical company, Novartis. During the quarter, Novartis announced the launch of 2 new once-daily medications to treat uncontrolled asthma in Japan. These products are called Enerzair and Atectura Breezhaler. In this market, patients using either the Enerzair or the Breezhaler manage their uncontrolled asthma will be able to acquire a Propeller technology sensor from physicians and then enroll in our Propeller digital health platform. The benefits of the platform are tremendous. The offering is a simple and convenient way to better live with sleep apnea with a fully integrated digital experience, with no incremental cost to the patient. It's great to see our Novartis partnership expanding to include now both Europe and Japan, leveraging our world-leading Propeller technology.
 Let me now briefly review our out-of-hospital Software as a Service business. During the quarter, our SaaS business grew in the mid-single digits year-on-year, driven by continued strong uptake of our HME resupply solutions. The COVID-19 market dynamics continue to impact the patient census volumes, particularly at skilled nursing facilities and new patient admissions have remained under pressure. We are maintaining our forecast that the SaaS market growth rate will be in the mid-single-digit range for the portfolio of verticals that we serve for fiscal 2021. We expect the portfolio to return to high single-digit growth as hospital and other outpatient surgery center discharge rates return to normal.
 We continue to invest in research and development for our SaaS businesses, so that we continuously improve on our market-leading solutions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice as well as private duty home care and life plan communities. As this portfolio of SaaS verticals returns to high single-digit growth, ResMed will continue to be there with our R&D resulting in leading Brightree and MatrixCare branded technology solutions, allowing us to better serve customers and therefore, to not just meet but to beat that market growth rate.
 A year ago, we announced that ResMed would begin collaborating with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions to control costs and to deliver seamless care across health care systems, from the hospital to the home. We have now integrated our MatrixCare branded home health and hospice platform with the electronic health record or EHR system from Cerner. I'm excited to let you know that we've expanded our relationship with Cerner to new offerings and have now entered into a new value-added reseller arrangement with Cerner. This establishes our Brightree technology as the preferred solution for Cerner's home medical equipment, pharmacy and home infusion customers. This development is the next step in the ResMed-Cerner relationship and will lead to better interoperability, it will lead to enhanced provider capabilities and it will lead to an improved patient experience. Overall, this partnership is performing above expectations for both ResMed and Cerner. We anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration to involve our core markets of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma disease management over time. Stay tuned.
 In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and remains an important driver of our digital transformation of health care in settings outside the hospital.
 2020 has been an unprecedented year for companies across every industry. The fundamentals of our ResMed business, however, remains strong, and we've maintained growth through this crisis through breakthrough innovation, through investments in recurring revenue businesses and effective execution in our operating excellence programs. COVID-19 has accelerated digital health adoption as well as awareness of respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of health care delivered away from a hospital. These trends are present during COVID, but they're here to stay.
 Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to once again express my sincere thanks to more than 7,500 ResMedians, who -- that's what we call ourselves around the world for their perseverance and strength, hard work and dedication during unique once-in-a-century circumstances. You have allowed hundreds of thousands of people around the world to get emergency ventilators and to have the gift of breath, while also keeping focus on making sure we have the best technology and solutions now and in the future for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and all those who need world-class care outside the hospital and preferably in their own home. Thank you all.
 With that, I'll hand the call now over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett, over to you. 
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and some remarks on our FY '21 outlook.
 As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $752 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the first quarter were favorably impacted by continued demand for ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from ventilator devices and related accessories derived from COVID-19 demand was approximately $40 million in the first quarter. Additionally, we experienced strong mask revenue growth in both our domestic and international markets. However, we did observe continuing headwinds in the sleep device market.
 Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $403 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $257 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or an increase of 10% in constant currency terms.
 By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $206 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $176 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an 11% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $81 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.
 Software as a Service revenue for the first quarter was $92 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 4%.
 During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and the fair value adjustment of equity investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.
 Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 30 basis points to 59.9% in the September quarter compared to 59.6% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased costs associated with logistics and procurement costs, together with typical declines in average selling prices. The cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 and our rapid ramp-up of ventilator production.
 We saw elevated airfreight costs relative to the prior year, but these are tracking sequentially lower, particularly as we rebalance from air freight to sea freight.
 Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $159 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses decreased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.1% compared to 24.6% we reported in the prior year quarter, benefiting from cost management and reduced travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses in Q2 to be broadly consistent with the prior year period and then in the second half of FY '21 to increase in the low single digits relative to the prior year period.
 R&D expenses for the quarter were $55 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to 7.1% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize our investments in innovation because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver a sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow year-over-year in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles.
 Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million.
 Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $237 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses.
 On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 17.4%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%.
 Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $185 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.27, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22.
 Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $144 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings, partially offset by increases in working capital.
 Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $57 million.
 We recorded equity losses of $2.3 million in our income statement in the September quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million in Q2 and approximately $5 million per quarter in the second half of FY '21 associated with the joint venture operation.
 We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $421 million. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion in gross debt and $635 million in net debt. Our debt levels remained modest. And at September 30, we had a further $1.2 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remains strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity.
 Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.
 Turning now to our FY '21 outlook. At a high level, we are now seeing a minimal COVID-19-generated demand for our ventilators and do not expect any incremental benefit in Q2 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to see a continued year-on-year headwind for sleep devices in Q2 in response to temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. However, at this time, we continue to forecast a sequential improvement in sleep devices through the course of FY '21.
 Masks and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience and growth over the past 3 months, reflecting the insulating value of the large patient installed base. We expect to see continued year-on-year growth of our mask portfolio in FY '21. Of course, like many other companies, we continue to experience significant uncertainty in the current environment. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.
 And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy. 
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Cheryl, let's go ahead and start the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs. 
Chris Cooper: Could you please -- I mean you mentioned at the start, the announcement from CMS this week. Could you just confirm your interpretation of where we stand with competitive bidding now? I mean the wording seem to suggest to us that the structure of the bid as a current standard is not working as they intended. Is your expectation at this stage that we just move on for the next 3-year cycle with competitive bidding? Or do you think they'll try and rerun it ahead of that? 
Michael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Chris. And look, the one thing we know is that January 1, 2021, the rates will remain where they are. And that -- it was great that CMS listened to feedback from the industry. And it wasn't just around COVID, it was really around the fact that reimbursement rates currently as they are fit for the need. And if you read through the detail, the CMS actually said that through the process, they found that they weren't going to have any savings as they put it, which meant from my perspective that we've reached sort of market equilibrium in terms of where things are at. Now that's my interpretation. But Dave Pendarvis studies this far more detail than I do. Dave, do you want to give some more color and thoughts around the CMS announcement these last few days? 
David Pendarvis: Sure. So Chris, yes, our view of the probable outcome here is you've got a 3-year run at least until January 1, 2024, of these current rates, plus inflation adjustments on January 1 on each of those years. Those are in the competitive bid areas. In addition to that, CMS has got a proposed rule-out, which if they finalize, would add a continuation of the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas. Those are both really good outcomes for our industry. They provide stability, they provide rates that these folks can count on, and they allow for any willing provider to be able to provide in the markets.
 Now you can always find legislative opportunities for the administration to do different things, to come in earlier, to change things up a little bit. That -- so is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? We don't think so. So we're going to be basing our plans on a continuation of these rates going forward with the caveat that governments can always do things that are unexpected and subject to their own control. 
Chris Cooper: Is there any risk that the commercial payers begin to take things into their own hands slowly and move ahead of Medicare? 
Michael Farrell: So Chris, the private payers were already ahead of CMS on this and had been sort of on a mark-to-market basis doing things at their own rates before competitive bidding started back in the mid-2000s during and after. And so I don't think it's a risk. It's a guarantee that private payers are looking for market rates. I think what's great about this one because it's so public versus those sort of private negotiations that happen is that we've seen a public statement of an equilibrium reached between the bids that came in and the fair price that is appropriate for the provision of these services in the statement. So that's something that's new as part of it. But look, it's a complex web. We sell in 140 countries worldwide, not just one. We watch CMS, but we also watch the rest of the world, and we want to make sure that reimbursement rates are there for our channel, but really importantly, that we get to the 936 million people worldwide who suffer from sleep apnea. 
Operator: Your next question is from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. 
Sean Laaman: I'd like to just ask about the sustainability and that suppression in SG&A growth. It seems like a very good outcome. If you could talk us through that? I know we've got guidance for fiscal '21, but if you could talk us through that, that would be really useful, Mick. 
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Sean. I'll start, and I'll hand over to Brett for some more detail. Yes, look, excellent control. Obviously, travel costs are incredibly down. We have 75%, 80% of all the ResMedians worldwide selling in 140 countries working from home. And we've had a really smooth transition to 4,000, 5,000 people working from home and feeling comfortable doing so. And we are opening up our offices as appropriate in Europe, Asia and the Americas as cities, states and so on allow us to.
 Look, when we get to the other side of this pandemic, and that's a long time potentially with a vaccine and treatments that are efficacious, I do see some of those costs starting to go back up again, but they will be also concomitant with opening of health care systems that will be associated with the opening up of those economies. And so I think we've done a really good job in bringing expenses down on SG&A, 7% reduction year-on-year for the quarter to $159 million for the September quarter.
 But if you look closely, we also increased our R&D spend. We increased by 12%, constant currency, our R&D spend. And that's $54.5 million for the quarter. You annualize that, that's a really good $200-plus million that we're going to put into digital health technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, improvements in smaller, quiet and more comfortable, more connected and more intelligent systems that can keep people breathing out of hospital and well taken care of. And so we are going to continue the investments in R&D and drive those through this crisis, and we are going to take the savings on SG&A now and be ready to reinvest in marketing and sales and growth in that SG&A as appropriate when the revenues start to come back. I hope that all makes sense, Sean. It's not just a one portfolio play, it's all part of a larger piece. 
Sean Laaman: No. That makes a lot of sense. Great results. 
Operator: Your next question... 
Brett Sandercock: Sean, it's Brett. The only thing I'd add to add to that, it's a good summary from Mick, there's not too much more to add there. But I mean, clearly, we're not going to have negative SG&A every quarter. And we have -- I've got in the back half to kind of low double digits. And for that low double digits, mid-single digits is probably what we've consistently done. Really, our aim is we want to leverage SG&A relative to revenue growth. So that hasn't gone away, but we want to continue to do that in the medium to long term as well. 
Operator: Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. 
Gretel Janu: So just at the last results, I think you mentioned that in July, you saw low single-digit revenue growth. This does then imply quite a sharp acceleration growth in August and September. So can you give us some more color on the incremental performance on a month-to-month basis as well as to how you performed into October? 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Gretel. It's a great question as we sort of model the kinetics of the recovery across our 140 countries. And as we look at it, and we -- obviously, I look at daily numbers, not just month-to-month and beyond, but there's a lot of sort of noise when you go down to a lower level of distraction. 
 You pull back and you look at sort of that quarter-on-quarter trend, what we're seeing is sequential growth across the group. And let's look at some -- look at 3 big countries. And I think I talked about this 90 days ago, Gretel, but Germany is sort of, I would say, our leading country in terms of how they're opening up their economy. 
 We are seeing at 85%, 90-plus percent of the pre-COVID patient flow and in some parts, 90% to 95% of the pre-COVID patient flow. It's through telehealth, it's through digital medicine, it's also through some in-person visits and in-lab tests. And so we're really at a very high point of recovery. 
 And even with Angela Merkel closing restaurants and bars here in November, we do expect health systems to remain fully open during not just November, but on an ongoing basis because people need to get their primary care, people need to get their respiratory care. If they're suffocating, they need treatment for their sleep apnea. If they have trouble breathing, they need help for their COPD. And so we're seeing that in a really good case in Germany.
 If you take China, another big market we talked about last quarter, sort of at the 50% of pre-COVID levels. This quarter, China is now already at 70% of pre-COVID patient flow across a very large country, but that portfolio of different cities and states is now at 70% of pre-COVID, so a significant improvement from last quarter. And here in the United States, it's really a story of 50 different states and their approaches, but they vary from 60% to 80% if you think about it of the pre-COVID patient flow. And so on average of around 70% here in our biggest market in the United States. So you take that all and you see, yes, there is pretty strong sequential improvement. It's not a dramatic sort of V shape we're back to January 1 or December 31, 2019. But the -- every week, it does get better. Every month, it does get better across the portfolio of countries. Even with the second and third waves of Northern Hemisphere, with the coming flu period, we expect to see sequential improvement in the flow of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients into our system. 
Operator: Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. 
Margaret Kaczor: I just wanted to follow-up a little bit about the drivers like you said of new patient adds and mostly improvements that you're seeing. I understand the 90%, 70%, 70% are pre-COVID levels. But how much of that is being driven by clinics, sleep clinics reopening relative to home sleep testing? Meaning is home sleep testing accelerating? And would that be a more sustainable trend as we go forward 2, 3 years from now that PCPs are adopting this and you can get a steady trend of new patient adds from there? 
Michael Farrell: Yes, Margaret, it's a really good question. I'm going to hand to Jim for some further detail on this way. Across the world, we're seeing home sleep test -- home sleep apnea testing picked up over time. COVID-19 has been an accelerator for that because it was the only choice during the severe lockdowns. And as we get to the other side, it is lower cost and has equivalent sensitivity and specificity from the technology that's out there. But Jim, what further color do you have on that? 
James Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Mick, and thanks, Margaret. It's a great question and it's a very insightful question. We don't have perfect data on this. But the data we do have and both the concrete data we have from sort of looking at our own devices that are used and also anecdotal data from the market very strongly suggests that home sleep testing across most of our markets has become a much higher percentage of testing. And to your point, I do think that that is sustainable. I think what we're seeing is a shift in practice. Patients certainly prefer it. And I think a number of clinicians are seeing that it's an easier way for them to diagnose, and they're certainly using home sleep testing and remote testing to serve their short-term patient needs. But as it gets adopted, I think we will see that practice remain very sustainable. And so in a market like France, we are already at something like 90% home sleep testing. We don't have perfect insight, as I said, but we do think home sleep test in the U.S. market has hit a very high percentage of tests, and we think that that will stick in the future. 
Michael Farrell: The one bit of color I'll add on there, just to tag onto what Jim said, Margaret, is Germany, where there was actually quite a strong resistance from some sleep physicians to adopt home sleep apnea testing. They were skeptical of the efficacy, the practicality and could they really make it work. And because of the shutdowns were very strong in Germany during the peak of the crisis in March, April, it was the only way they could diagnose. The doctors then got used to it. And to Jim's point, I think on the other side of this, France will move up a little bit, but Germany will move up significantly in the percentage of patients with home sleep apnea testing as those doctors found that it was not only -- had high sensitivity and specificity on the clinical level, but it also had good outcomes at lower costs. 
Operator: Your next question is from David Low of JPMorgan. 
Michael Farrell: David, you may be on mute. 
David Low: Yes. No, no. I was just getting the mute off. If I could just go back to the ventilators, I mean what I understood from was said that there was a $40 billion boost coming through there, and that we really should expect that that's pretty much done now. So that normalizes. And if we adjust for that, it would imply that the device sales growth was significantly lower. Just wondering how you think we should think about the recovery from here? I mean are we at the point now where device sales ex-ventilators can start to grow given how strong the recovery seems to have been through the quarter? 
Michael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question. I'll hand to Brett for some further detail on it after my remarks. But look, we've seen -- we saw incredible sort of $30 million in the March quarter, triple-digit millions of dollars in the June quarter, and as you noted, $40 million in the September quarter of what I would call emergency ventilator sales as part of the crisis. It may not go to precisely 0 this quarter, but it won't be as high in the December quarter as it was in the September quarter. And hopefully, as we're seeing the second and third waves, the magnitude, as I said in the prepared remarks, is lower of the second and third waves in terms of the impact on hospitalizations and reaching that sort of peak, ICU peak ventilator capacity. And so on a humanitarian basis, I hope we're right in that prediction that it goes very quickly down.
 We are seeing sequentially, from the June quarter to the September quarter, improvements in the number of patients coming through, the prescriptions coming through, and therefore, the devices that we are selling on the sleep side. We expect that improvement to continue through the December quarter. And so as you look through the fiscal year and you think about sort of modeling how that's going to happen, I think you can model a steady increase in the sleep apnea devices. And the sort of, what I will call a secular uptick in masks and accessories sales that was driven by, I think, respiratory hygiene and the importance of getting a clean mask, was not a onetime thing for the March or June quarter. You saw it was sustainable. As we predicted, it was sustainable here through the September quarter. And I think it's sustainable through the December quarter.
 I'm a patient and I know how important it is and how exciting it is, frankly, to get that new mask, to get that new cushion and to establish it up. It's like a brand-new cast mill and you get addicted to saying, "Wow, respiratory health is important," and that is one thing through the suffering of COVID-19. It's almost a blessing that we've seen people realize that sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, respiratory health is incredibly important and keeping your device clean and keeping your mask clean is incredibly important as well as accessing data digitally has been incredibly important. So we think all of that will be there, and that's why we talk about this strong sequential increase, steady sequential increase throughout fiscal 2021. Brett, any further color? 
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean that's good now. I mean, Dave, you're right. I mean, obviously, year-on-year, we saw declines in sleep devices. But we saw a pretty strong sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And then going forward, as Mick said, we will -- we still think we'll see that sequential improvement. Now where does that end up in Q2, Q3, increase or decrease, we won't -- time will tell. But certainly, we're seeing that nice sequential increase week-to-week, month-to-month, which gives us, I think, a lot of confidence of sleep devices improving throughout FY '21. I think that's the main thing we're looking at. It's that nice strong financial increase, I think, that will give us a lot of confidence. 
David Low: Just on topic, I know I don't want to ask the second question. But I mean, I take $40 million of devices, actually, negative 1.6% growth for the quarter. So it looks pretty close to flat there. And I presume that's indicative of where CPAPs at relative to the same time last year. 
Michael Farrell: Yes, there will be some -- yes, I mean, there's constant currency adjustments, things like that, but certainly decreased, single-digit decreases. 
Operator: Your next question is with Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. 
Lyanne Harrison: Just following on from Margaret Kaczor's question. Thinking about the initiatives that have been put in place as a result of coronavirus, including telehealth, home sleep testing, can you give us some indication of how the reimbursement works for that? With home sleep testing, for example, are patients more likely to be out of pocket? And do you think that the reimbursement with the likes of telehealth will remain post coronavirus? 
Michael Farrell: Lyanne, it's a great question, and it talks to how sustainable is what we're talking about earlier, Jim and I around home sleep apnea testing being adopted. In general, the costs for home sleep apnea testing are significantly below for the payer, the employer and the ultimate payer is the person who works for that company or pays the taxes in that country. So the numbers of the costs are significantly lower, often in order of magnitude lower. And so therefore, the copayments, if you're part of, say, U.S. plan like I'm, we have copayments, the copayment is proportional to the cost. And so therefore, an order of magnitude lower. So it is lower cost.
 And the question that physicians always had is, is it better care or at least as good care at lower cost. And I think what we saw through COVID-19, where people who hadn't adopted home sleep apnea testing as well, were forced to adopt it because it was the only way they could diagnose patients. They found well, the sensitivity and specificity from that clinical peer-reviewed article does happen in my practice, in my state, in my city. And so lower cost, as good outcomes, we saw great adoption. And I think that drives ongoing growth of it on a sustainable basis. As Jim was talking to earlier, I think countries that were x move to y, where y is above x, and we can't predict exactly what that permanent change is going to be. We just know it's going to move up because the momentum of economics and good clinical care just drive it that way. So I don't know, Jim, if you have any further color to provide on that from your last response on home sleep apnea testing. 
James Hollingshead: I just would completely reiterate what you said. And as a reminder, if you're on a, let's say, U.S. market, if you're a consumer and you have a health plan, you have a 20% copay. If a typical lab test is $1,500 or $1,800, that you're out of pocket on that at 20%. If the typical home sleep test is reimbursed at, say, $250, $200, you're much lower out of pocket. And so for consumers, the barrier is much lower to do a home sleep test here. Most consumers would prefer a home sleep test. And so that's why I think we'll see it remain sticky.
 Now to telehealth, which I think was the second part of your question, some of those reimbursements have been done on sort of an emergency basis. The question is how? Will they persist after the emergency situations are declared nonemergency? There are a number of reasons to think that they will. I think that they've been very successful. And of course, the industry is lobbying very hard to put some of the things in place, both with government payers and with commercial payers. And so I think that most payers have seen telehealth to be pretty successful in terms of driving coverage and also driving down cost of care. So we can be optimistic about that. And I think the whole industry is working on it. 
Michael Farrell: Yes. And this has actually been a sort of public-private partnership during COVID-19 as we all made the ventilators and partnered with the governments to do so that we have partnered on digital health, bringing -- as Jim said, bringing the emergency user authorization capability for that. 
 There were actually codes that CMS had for digital health that were being underutilized in 2019. They brought them out early, I believe, in 2019. And even in 2018, we're doing some trials with them, and they were actually upset at CMS that the digital health codes weren't being utilized enough. 
 COVID-19 drove an acceleration of that. And I think it will allow, again, the same thing as home sleep apnea testing applies to telehealth and all remote patient care, it's better during COVID times that you not go to that clinic because you won't get as exposed, not to that hospital, you won't get as exposed. 
 It's also better during normal times, if you can do stuff at lower cost with better outcomes and not having to go to that hospital, not having to go to that clinic, if you can do it from the comfort of your own home. And as Jim said, the consumer prefers lower cost and at their own home, and that's all of ResMed's strategies to give that health care way you want it. 
Operator: Next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. 
Matt Mishan: Mick, I'll keep this one simple. Can you just give us a sense of when Propeller Health can become more meaningful to the P&L? 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Matthew. Good question. Propeller Health is early phase in terms of the technology. It's certainly having a huge impact in getting a major multi-hundred billion-dollar pharma companies to adopt it with their brand-new prescribable drugs, particularly in the asthma space in Europe and Japan. As to when it becomes a material part of ResMed's P&L and I'm breaking it out on a quarterly basis, it's going to be a while for that. And so it won't be in here in fiscal 2021. But as we look to our 2025 strategy over these next 5 years, I do expect that that type of digital health solution is going to be a double-digit part of ResMed's delivery, and I will be talking about it on a quarterly basis, not just through milestones of pharmaceutical company releases with lead products and brand-new not generics, but high-end prescribable products. I think that we will see this go well beyond where it started just here in asthma. It will go across COPD. And there are literally billions -- tens of billions of dollars that could be saved in keeping COPD patients out of hospital with better adherence to their drugs.
 Our work has shown that we can improve adherence rates by up to 58% and lower total cost of emergency visits and emergency costs by 25%. But look, it's a great question, Matthew. I'm not going to predict the exact quarter and timing, but I can tell you that over the next 20 quarters, it will become a significant part. We will be calling it out because it works. And pharmaceutical companies know how to do things at scale. And when they start to see that it improves the outcomes for their patients, that their doctors are happier and most importantly, that the patients are happier and out of hospital, lower cost, better outcomes, it's going to take off very quickly, exponentially. 
Operator: Your next question is from Saul Hadassin of UBS. 
Saul Hadassin: Mick, can I just ask you, I don't think it was in your prepared remarks, but you did preview the Lumis HFT device at the ERS Conference this quarter. Can you talk to, I guess, a bit more detail as to where you see that device sitting in within the portfolio of the ResMed offering and when we might expect to see that device commercialized? 
Michael Farrell: Yes. I'll provide just a little overview, and then I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to provide further. Look, what we've seen during COVID-19 is a variety of different products and solutions that have been used for patients from oxygen to high-flow therapy, to full noninvasive ventilation and then full invasive intubated ventilation. So I think there was some good exposure to what high-flow therapy can do with COVID because it can provide some of the particles to move around hospitals and so on. HFT did not get as frontline on its therapy as fully intubated ventilators. But we think it gave some good exposure and has accelerated a little bit. Yes, this is very early days with high-flow therapy, but it's a technology that we've put together on some of our existing platforms with great intellectual property and great opportunities for growth over time. But Rob, do you want to provide some further detail on what we're doing with Lumis HFT? 
Robert Douglas: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick. So yes, we think HFT is clearly a valid treatment and got some very interesting use cases. We -- again, you know our strategy is out of hospital, and it hasn't been strongly studied in those types of environments. So really, it's more part of a long-term play to see how HFT might fit in with our long-term strategy. It's a trial that will take its time to enroll patients. These respiratory device trials in the home setting are generally pretty tough to do and so -- and take a time. So we won't be reporting out of that super quickly, but it's certainly a very interesting area for us, and we think we've got some good solutions. 
Operator: Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. 
Suraj Kalia: Mick, one question from my side. The SaaS unit is now growing at single digits. Can you help us understand the structural dynamics that could possibly push the segment back to double-digit growth? Is there price elasticity of demand? Are you looking at OUS adoption? Are acquisitions the key? Just help us frame this segment, in particular, for the next 12, 24 months. 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. So Software as a Service, our SaaS division, is 12% of our revenues. It's a really important part of our long-term growth to apply our digital health technology capability outside the hospital and in the 7 verticals we're in where we're a market leader in the top 1 or 2 of each of those categories. Yes, as I noted in the prep remarks, Suraj, we've seen a slowdown of the flow of patients into hospitals and therefore, out of hospitals to skilled nursing facilities, in particular, as well as nursing homes and others. And we do expect that that, sort of, if you like, recovery will take some time. And that's why I sort of said that the markets that we serve as a weighted average portfolio growth will grow in those sort of mid-single digits throughout this fiscal year. We expect to meet that and beat that where we can.
 And then as we get to beyond the sort of 12-month time frame, I do think there's opportunities for those markets to get to the high single-digit growth. And with inorganic plays, there are opportunities to get to low double-digit growth across that portfolio. Look, we never accept market growth. 
 We want to meet it and beat it. One thing we are doing in that division as well as in our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma groups is we're investing in innovation. We have great -- in the beauty of Software as a Service innovation is you're talking weeks between sprints and then getting an MVP out there to provide a solution to customers. 
 And so we have seen some really good innovation come into play to help people deal with COVID-19 that have helped them sort of through this crisis. And we think that when we get back to the sort of normal flow through hospitals and ASCs of patients getting discharged into the out-of-hospital post-acute network, we will start to see the centers pick up and therefore, the revenues pick up as the number of patients in that setting picks up over time. 
 And so yes, look, we have a leading position. We're going to do well in the mid-single digits. We'll do well in the high single digits. And over time, as we add inorganically, we can push even beyond that. 
Operator: Your next question is from David Bailey of Macquarie. 
David Bailey: Mick, you sort of touched on the resupply coming through, expecting that to continue into the second quarter. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you're seeing that opportunity over the medium to longer term? Do you think there's further opportunities on the resupply? And then within that mask and accessories as well, just whether you think some of the new product launches are driving increased share for ResMed? That would be great. 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, David. Yes, that's a 2-part question. So I'll have a go. Actually, you know, I'm going to hand the whole question to Jim Hollingshead rather than do half of it. Over to you, Jim. 
James Hollingshead: Thank you for the question, David. I mean we think -- we've been obviously quite pleased with the dynamics of resupply through Q1. We expect it to continue in Q2. And actually, I do think what's going on, especially, probably, globally, but the dynamics of resupply are really a specific to U.S. market where reimbursed. And we think what's going on is that, a, patients want new clean equipment, they're more synthesized to that because of the pandemic; and b, our HME provider customers have realized that that's an avenue that's both better for the patients and better for patient care, but also better for their own business. So we think that dynamic should stay.
 One thing -- we had a question earlier about competitive bidding. One of the good results at a competitive bidding being delayed for some period of time is that it won't change mask reimbursement. And so we think that with the competitive bidding reannouncement, it maintains the economics of resupply that exist in the U.S. market, which is our biggest resupply market. And that's one of the reasons we think that the dynamics for that part of the market will persist through, I think, at least in the fiscal year. I think that it will remain robust. So we've got a change in customer behavior, change in patient behavior, both of which tend to resupply and then stability and reimbursement. And I think those are really key points.
 On market share, we have the broadest and most effective portfolio of masks and accessories on the market. We can -- with our range of products now and with our latest launch of the AirTouch N20, our line is complete across our range of masks, and we can provide a certain fit for every patient with the right mask every time. None of our competitors come even close to what we offer in the market, and we feel really good about our share and position and our ongoing innovation. 
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. 
Andrew Goodsall: Just thinking about the quarter, just wondering if you saw any DME restocking effect in the quarter. And also if I could just ask you to talk to oxygen, whether that's still getting us some tailwind with COVID? 
Michael Farrell: So the first question about restocking, second one about POCs. Look, Brett, do you want to take something with regard to the restocking and talk about inventory levels from Q-on-Q? And then, Rob, do you want to have a go at the oxygen question. Over to you, Brett, first? 
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure, Mick. I mean typically on the whole DME, they don't hold too much inventory. So I guess they've got -- they typically buy pretty regularly. I'm not sure. I mean, as volumes have come up and patient flows come back. Obviously, there's orders coming in the system to support the patient flow coming back, and we're seeing that sequentially, but I'm not sure they're really restocking like huge orders. They'll restock as the patient flow comes back in a pretty orderly fashion. And obviously, we're seeing that throughout our revenues and sequentially what's happening there. But I wouldn't say it is characterized by significant restocking orders. I think that's a bit more steady flow that we're seeing coming through it. 
Andrew Goodsall: Okay. So I got a reasonable match up with the sort of return of patients to return of orders? 
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I think so because they don't like holding a lot of inventory. So they all typically do -- they can get inventory quite quickly from the manufacturers, and they'll typically operate -- obviously, they need enough inventory. And -- but I think the patient flow will drive their order patterns. 
Andrew Goodsall: That's great. And then just on POC. 
Robert Douglas: Andrew, yes, our POC program sort of just continues as we have -- we continue to learn. We've still got our products in their sort of product launch, process and post that. And we continue to learn, and we're sort of still making adjustments and experiments of how to get the right patients to the right providers for the right treatment there. So it's pretty much a sort of a long-term thing for us on that. 
Andrew Goodsall: No particular call out on COVID around that? 
Robert Douglas: No. Not that material to our overall business. 
Operator: Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. 
Anthony Petrone: Maybe just a couple on math questions on vents and NIVs and just comments in relation to COVID cases and NIVs going forward. And so when we back out the $40 million from devices and you sort of bake in patient flows in core sleep, I'm just wondering, again, the math doesn't quite get there to low single digits. So I'm wondering if pricing, in particular, firmed up in the quarter that can kind of get you there or other respiratory was better.
 And then again, the comment on NIVs going forward, potentially not being a driver. Just wondering why that would be considering where the case counts are going? 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Anthony. Yes, look, it's a complex equation, and there are so many moving pieces with second and third waves as regards to the global pandemic. So all we know about every prediction that's been made in the last 9 months is they're wrong. So we don't know precisely what the needs are going to be through the second and third waves. And last quarter, we were a bit muted about what we thought would happen this quarter and then we had $40 million worth of sales in the September quarter. But look, our best projections of the sort of epidemiology and sort of humanitarian model that we put together at the flow of COVID-19 around 140 countries that we treat in within the big countries, specifically in some cities and states that we're looking at, we don't think we're going to reach a state where there's going to be hospitalizations like we had early January, February in Wuhan, and then March -- February, March in Milan and then March, April in New York, where you reached 100% capacity and literally ran out of ventilators and ran out of ICU beds for those ventilators.
 Our best models show that the magnitude of the second and third waves are actually reduced in cities in China, that we've seen second and third waves, across Singapore, where we've seen them in in some parts of Europe, where we're already seeing them. And so we're just being realistic that we don't expect sort of those emergency use ventilators to be at the sort of magnitude. And you can actually see that it went from a triple-digit millions in the June quarter, down to $40 million in the September quarter. It will be significantly reduced here in the December quarter. I'm not saying it will necessarily be de minimis, but it might be. And look, our job is to focus on our core market and the coming back of that. And what we're seeing is our investments in digital health, we've made these last 5 years and how we're the market leader there, have incredibly well set us up for the growth in that.
 And so I think as you start to look at modeling ResMed looking at a year-on-year is going to be a very difficult and complex equation, which I'm not sure you'll ever get to the right answer until, even us until the numbers are in on it. What we can look at is Q-on-Q, quarter-on-quarter sequential sleep apnea, COPD, across those devices portfolio, across those masks portfolio, from Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. We're going to see sequential increase in the sleep devices. We're going to see increase in the sleep and COPD masks and accessories as we go through that quarter.
 So complex equation, yes, down sort of in the single digits year-on-year in devices, but hugely complex equation with tailwinds and headwinds. Look at Q-on-Q, when you start to see the positive trend of what's happening as we're opening up and as economies are working out how to run digital health and home sleep apnea testing and remote COPD diagnosis and prescriptions for asthma and getting patients on to the platforms like Propeller, like AirView for ventilation, like AirSense 10 and its Air Solutions platform. And that's where we're investing, and that's where, frankly, our technology will win. 
Operator: Your last question will come from David Low of JPMorgan. 
David Low: Thought I'd cancel that one. But just one last question. We've got some reports that some of ResMed's masks were in back orders through the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk to that, what might have caused it? How significant it was? And I guess I'm trying to understand whether it was demand driven or whether there was any supply issues there, please? 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, David. Yes, yes, I believe it was demand driven, as you saw, we had really good numbers in the quarter. But Jim, do you know any details of -- across the sleep business? 
James Hollingshead: Yes, without trying to go math by math... 
Michael Farrell: Right. 
James Hollingshead: Most of the back orders that we faced were demand driven. There were some logistical issues as well in the supply chain. We've had also some domestic shipping issues. Little things here and there that have been an issue, but it's almost all demand driven. 
Operator: We are now at the 75 minute mark, so I will turn the call over to Mick Farrell. 
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd like to take the opportunity here at the end to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom, almost all of whom are shareholders as well for their dedication, hard work, helping people sleep better, breathe better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes who are going to our plants and production plants, our distribution plants, our tech services centers, and actually, because you have to touch physical product not being able to work from home. Thank you for following all safety procedures and doing that really well through this crisis. I look forward to talking to all of our shareholders here in around 90 days. Amy, I hand over to you to close out. 
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all of the documents, along with the transcript and a replay of our call today will be available on our website later. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close our call. 
Operator: This concludes ResMed's first quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-08-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2020 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Thanks for joining us. The call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release and earnings presentation. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today. During this global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, and COVID-19, the disease state that leads to, I hope that you, your family, and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times. Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei Province, China, put on a hazmat suit and help set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan. Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus. Not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America, and now we're just starting to prepare and to -- actually we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that what we call the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs. So, I noted in our call, 90 days ago, our Q3 call that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve. During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and non-invasive ventilators, including bi-level positive pressure ventilators. That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020. So, we've delivered on our promise to triple our production, and in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30 for 2020, that is a 3.5x increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5x. For our flagship ventilator, which is the Astral life-support ventilator, we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rates during the period, and we're still running at full capacity for the Astral to ensure that ResMed is there for what we call preservation of life as the coronavirus continues to move around the globe. I'm particularly proud of the role that our supply chain, our manufacturing, our distribution, and our tech services teams have played during this coronavirus crisis, making sure that ResMed device and a complete ventilation system was there at the bedside when someone needed help breathing as their immune system fights against COVID-19. So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country, and by ResMed business line. Through that analysis, I'm happy to say that we're confident in our ResMed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses. The tailwinds for ventilation in the March quarter and the June quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede, and while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals, as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators, the volumes will be significantly lower in the September quarter for these ventilators. At the same time, the headwinds we experienced especially in the June quarter for our sleep apnea and COPD patient flow and patient diagnosis are also receding. So, people are starting to return for their primary care physician visits, they're starting to return for their specialist physician visits, and we see the system today growing from its nadir during the last period as we now see city-by-city and country-by-country the markets are coming back online. So, over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual sequential quarter-to-quarter U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physician, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021. We expect the expansion of home sleep apnea testing to continue as it did during the crisis, we think it will continue post the crisis, and we also expect a steady sort of sequential increase in sleep lab activity and visits to the pulmonary specialists both in person and through Telehealth, which has been expanding rapidly under COVID. Additionally, some very early research into the post-COVID clinical world shows that select patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may have lung damage, and some of them may require long-term ventilator support. This is an additional area of focus for us, but I have to say, it's very early days in that area. In my prepared remarks today, I will provide some insights into our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2020 business performance. I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy. Finally, I'll discuss how we're advancing and learning in a post-COVID peak world, including how this pandemic has accelerated three important trends; one, the importance of respiratory medicine; two, the importance of digital health; and three, the importance of outside hospital healthcare. These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategies that were in play well before the global pandemic, but these are three trends that have accelerated during this pandemic, and we think the momentum will continue in a post-COVID world. So, for our business performance, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2020. We had year-on-year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed. Our results reflect strong growth and positive momentum across our innovative MedTech portfolio and our market-leading digital health software solutions. We have grown our global market footprint finding new patients in the midst of a global pandemic, and we have driven growth with recurring revenue from our installed base of sleep apnea patients. While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma remains strong and well-positioned for long-term growth. During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in-person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and our software-as-a-service businesses. We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term growth opportunities with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs. Importantly, we have also seen significant growth in our digital health ecosystem. We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the Air Solutions platform. We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million, 100% Cloud connectable medical devices in the market, and we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution. Our digital health ecosystem is a competitive advantage for ResMed that offers innovative solutions, as well as integrated care to drive superior outcomes, better patient experiences, and lower healthcare system costs. Our acquisition and continued investment and development of the Propeller platform, has been a digital health accelerant for ResMed. Our recently-announced commercial partnership with Novartis, which I will describe in more detail later during the call, is a great example of this progress with Propeller. During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe. Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem. These data form a significant competitive advantage as they enable us to perform sophisticated analytics, and drive actionable insights to benefit all their customer groups, including the patients, most importantly, but also in improving workflows for physicians, for providers, for payers, and for full healthcare systems. Fundamentally, we believe the future of healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where we win today. Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea. There are over 380 million people, who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma, they all need our help. And they all want that help at home, definitely not in a hospital. Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care le2veraging the global trend for seniors to age in place, we think this trend will accelerate in a post-COVID world. ResMed can provide seamless care for our portfolio of out of hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technologies, the recognition of the value of remote monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the evolution of global reimbursement models in the field of digital health. This acceleration of digital health adoption represents a significant medium to long-term tailwind for our business. These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health, and the increased importance of out of hospital health care, will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025. So, on to our operating priorities, we have three operating priorities that guide our daily focus here at ResMed, number one is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these under penetrated markets is actually a number one priority; and number two priority is to design, develop and deliver world leading medical devices as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers as well as patients, so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience; and number three priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital. We think ResMed is uniquely positioned to deliver on these three priorities. So, I'll quickly walk through some examples of innovation in each of these priorities, and then will hand over to Brett and go to Q&A. In our core market of sleep apnea, we launched what we call the ResMed MaskSelector into our U.S. geography. The ResMed MaskSelector is a digital health technology to make remote patient mask selection and sizing both easier and more effective, helping the patient themselves receive the care they need from home. We think that this is the digital solution to help our HME medical equipment or HME customers in their challenge to find the right mask for each patient when they can't physically touch them due to physical distancing during COVID-19. We are providing this solution at no charge during the coronavirus public health emergency. However, we think this technology's efficiency and benefits for both providers and patients will last well beyond the pandemic. Digital tools like this as well as capabilities including video support for doctors and their patients, as well as remote mask patient fittings have seen good application during COVID-19 combined without mask resupply solutions, including SnapWorx, [Oracle], [ph] and Brightree ReSupply. We have delivered solid mass growth. In terms of new patient flow, the COVID lockdowns have had a significant impact on our business. We saw double-digit declines in new sleep apnea patient flow across all markets that experienced lockdowns, individual cities, regions and countries had unique approaches to any lockdown and reopening processes. For instance, today in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running, whereas in China, the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography; most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes. In big countries like the U.S., it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again as a spectrum between these boundary conditions. The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability, but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range. As I stated earlier, we expect a steady sequential quarter-by-quarter sort of U-shaped recovery of the sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma patient flow throughout fiscal 2021. Clearly, a highly effective vaccine or a highly efficacious treatment for COVID-19 could of course turn that U-shaped into a dramatic V-shaped recovery. However, we're not counting on that and an event like that remains upside from what we call our expected or likely case scenario. In terms of execution in our second key disease, state of COPD and our ventilation solutions for COPD, and other lung conditions, we launched our cloud-based remote monitoring software called AirView for our ventilator solution in Europe, including the Astral product, the Stellar ventilator, and the Lumis ventilator. Through AirView, clinicians and care providers can now remotely monitor their patient's respiratory rate, as well as their blood oxygen saturation. These are two critical indicators for a respiratory patient's condition. We accelerate the delivery of this technology for clear and urgent needs during the pandemic. However, this enhanced AirView capability providing insights across European ventilation patient populations will provide differentiation for ResMed through the clinical value for positions and better outcome for patients in perpetuity. In terms of execution in our third key disease state of asthma ResMed has partnered with Novartis to co-package the Propeller solution and digital platform with the new triple action asthma medication in a brand called Enerzair Breezhaler. This novel combination has been cleared by the European Commission for launch. The Propeller sensor attaches to the new inhaler from Novartis, and its new medication, where it can collect medication usage data. The app works both as an adherence measure that gives the patient reminders to take the medication, but also as a means of collecting information about the patient's medical condition to help their physician provide even better care to the patient. This is a breakthrough innovation as it is the first time a respiratory medicine has been co-packaged with a digital health platform and co-prescribed. The benefits of this combination are tremendous for the patient. It's a simple and convenient way to have a fully integrated experience to allow them to better live with their chronic disease to better live with asthma, with no incremental cost to the patient. This brand-new approval is a new to the world technology that will accelerate the adoption of digital health in the respiratory medicine space, and will help us identify other innovative opportunities to combine our Propeller tech with medicine delivery. This new Novartis partnership follows our announcement in May that the Propeller sensor and an apps gained 510(k) U.S. 510(k) clearance for use with the Symbicort inhaler for both asthma and COPD patients from AstraZeneca. This sensor is built to fit various inhalers and the generic equivalents. Propeller's cloud-based system tracks medication usage of the Symbicort from these inhalers through a smartphone app, which patients can use to paint a clearer picture of their disease control for their clinicians. These new partnerships with both Novartis and AstraZeneca, and previously-announced collaborations with Ryan, as well as Boehringer Ingelheim expand the potential reach of Propeller's technology to around 90% of inhaled medicines for both asthma and COPD in the United States. We believe that this represents a significant upside opportunity for the expansion of the Propeller platform in the U.S. market, but also around the world as the benefits of digital health grow and move around the world. So, before I transition to details of our software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why the SAAS business is integral to ResMed's long-term strategy to provide seamless transitions between hospital care and post acute care, or as we call it here at ResMed out-of-hospital care, because we don't think you have to go to hospital to get good care outside the hospital. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient's health data moves with him as they transition care settings, giving providers the information they need to deliver personalized care and saving the person and the caregiver both time and money. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only long-term strategic player with solutions that span across these seven important out-of-hospital, healthcare verticals. Home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew 7% compared to the year ago period. We are integrating and optimizing the out-of-hospital SAAS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of these SAAS verticals that we're in is in the high single digits. The COVID-19 market impact has particularly affected the skilled nursing facility census levels and that vertical that we serve. We believe this impact will continue over the next several quarters, moving the weighted average market growth of these verticals to the mid single digit range for our SAAS businesses for that period with return to high single digits as we start to see other analogous things such as elective surgeries and hospital discharges return to their normal rates at which time we believe that that market's weighted average market growth rate will return to the high single digits. Our goal here at ResMed is always to not just meet, but to beat that market growth through delivery of superior market leading solutions. Turning to more details of our SAAS business performance during the quarter, we've been pleased with the early impact of SnapWorx Technology, which we acquired in February. As we discussed on our last earnings call, SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The timing of this acquisition couldn't have been better with COVID-19. Our HME customers have been increasingly focused on resupply and better tech to interact with patients in a no touch non-contact world. The combination of SnapWorx as well as Oracle, and Brightree ReSupply, and all of these three technologies are under our Brightree brand, they provide the strongest suite of resupply solutions available in the market period. This technology is important to our customers to their patients as well as to our internal SAAS business and our core sleep apnea business, driving both patient engagement and better outcomes as well as revenue growth. In October 2019, we announced that ResMed entered into an agreement with Cerner Corporation to help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions, control costs, and deliver seamless care across healthcare systems. We have now integrated our Brightree branded home health and hospice platform with the Cerner Electronic Health Record, or EHR. This partnership is performing above our expectations for both Cerner and for ResMed and we anticipate opportunities to deepen and expand this collaboration as we continue to work together. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is performing well and reminds an important driver of our digital transformation of healthcare in settings outside the hospital. The COVID headwinds in the near-term will recede, and we will continue to invest now and in the future in research and development, to make sure ResMed has the best solutions for long-term growth and market leadership. The future healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. COVID-19 has accelerated that, and we here at ResMed are well positioned to capitalize on. Our diversified solution portfolio and capabilities are related against the compelling and expanding market opportunity in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma, and out-of-hospital SaaS. Through the first seven months of this COVID-19 crisis and this calendar year, we've maintained strong growth through our effective execution, our right to innovation, our recurring revenue businesses, as well as margin expansion driven by our global operating excellence programs. While we look forward to moving COVID-19 into the rearview mirror, there are beneficial trends, it has accelerated, which are now passing more over their actually persistent and we believe impactful. The importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of digital health and the importance of healthcare delivered outside the hospital. Those three trends just go accelerated and they're here to stay. While these macro trends have increased Telehealth and increased remote patient monitoring represent short, medium, and long-term benefits the ResMed's business. More importantly, they represent tailwinds for significant improvement on the most critical patient metrics, improving clinical outcomes for the patient's chronic disease and enhancing levels of patient satisfaction for that ultimate customer. The person who just wants to sleep better, breath better, and live with a better quality of life. So before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to express my personal gratitude to the 7,500, ResMedians around the world. In an unprecedented fiscal year, you have remained focused on creating value in our core markets and honoring commitments to patients through COVID-19, you helped us pivot and produce 150,000 lifesaving ventilators to help people breathe in 140 countries worldwide. Without our team, our current and future success would not be possible. So thank you to you to all of you. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, we will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and some remarks on our Q1 FY '21, outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $770 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%, compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the fourth quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilated devices and accessories, partially offset by declines in our sleep business. We estimated the incremental net revenue benefit from COVID-19 related impacts within the order of $20 million. Reflecting estimated incremental ventilator and related accessory revenue of $125 million partially offset by an estimated $105 million impact on our sleep revenue, relative to our pre-COVID forecasts. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software as a Service business. Our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $401 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets, total $278 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and an increase of 22% in constant currency terms. Byproduct segment U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $206 million, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter. Mask and other sales were $195 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales total $206 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 35% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $73 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, a 6% decrease. Globally in currency terms device sale increased by 16% while mask and other sales increased by 3% over prior year quarter. Software as a Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $91 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis SaaS revenue increased by 6%. During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impacted amortization of acquired intangibles the purchase accounting, fair value adjustments and matrixcare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings, press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points to 59.9% in the June quarter, compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year, the increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix partially offset by increased costs in logistics, component parts and manufacturing. These cost increases largely reflect the impact of COVID-19 in our rapid ramp up and ventilator production. In particular, we incurred significantly higher inbound and outbound air freight costs during the quarter, reflecting both higher volumes and significantly higher rates. We are rebalancing air freight and sea freight volumes, but in the meantime, we expect to see elevated freight costs continue into Q1 FY '21. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $165 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. We're in constant currency terms SG&A expenses were consistent with the prior year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 21.5%, compared to the 24.3%, we reported in the prior quarter benefiting from cost management and reduce travel as we work through the uncertain COVID-19 environment. Looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits relative to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $53 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue with 6.8%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year. We continue to prioritize investments in innovation, because we believe our long-term commitment to technology and product development will deliver sustained competitive advantage. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single-digits to low double-digits, reflecting, our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles is $20 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% over the prior quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $16 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $243 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin, and well managed operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 16.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 17% to 19%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $193 million, an increase of 40% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.33, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.22. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $330 million reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $39 million. During the quarter, WE also paid dividends of $56 million. We recorded equity losses of $6 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with a fairly joint venture. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $15 million for the full fiscal year 2021 associated with the joint venture operations. We ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $463 million, having generated $330 million in operating cash flow during the fourth quarter and $802 million during our fiscal year 2020. At June 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $717 million in net debt. Our debt levels remain modest in the June 30, we had just under $1.1 billion available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility. In summary, our liquidity position remained strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are currently managing expenses cash flow, and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, reflecting the board's confidence and our strong liquidity position and operating performance. Finally, to recap on Q4 results, our earnings this quarter were very strong reflecting significant demand for ventilators, underpinning revenue growth and expansion in our gross margin and lower operating expenses. Turning now to our first quarter of FY 2021 outlook, at a high level, we expect to see continued demand for ventilators but at a significantly lower level compared to Q4 FY 2020. Additionally, we expect to see continued headwinds for sleep device sales in Q1 in response to the temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Mask and accessories have continued to demonstrate resilience over the past three months which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Consistent with these remarks for the first month of Q1 FY 2021, we recorded group revenue growth in the low single digits. However, like many other companies, we're experiencing pervasive uncertainty in the current environment. As a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you have follow-ups or additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Cheryl, we're now ready to start the Q&A portion.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Saul Hadassin: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just a question for me; Mick, just some color around the rest of the world growth rate, the disparity between device sales at a very strong 35% benchmark at negative 6%, can you just talk to ventilation and how that impacted there and whether there was anything else to read into that mask growth rate, please?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So, thanks for the question, and yes, clearly now Europe -- you know, that is Europe, Asia, and rest of world, so it's the whole world apart from the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, clearly incredibly strong year-on-year growth in the devices side primarily driven on the upside by the ventilator sales, and so, these were, you know, we've had talked about contracts with national governments in the U.K., France, Germany for ventilator sales that were delivered during that June quarter and others around Asia and rest of world. So, that's been the sort of this tailwind if you like from COVID-19, and the headwinds, there were pretty dramatic shutdowns that we saw certainly in Western Europe and most parts of Southeast Asia, including China, which is still at 50% of its fleet capacity today, and that severely slowed down first time set up of patients, but in those geographies, the sort of resupply technology that I talked about in the prepared remarks like SnapWorx, [Oracle] [ph], and Brightree ReSupply, those are all U.S. based technologies, and we really haven't put those technology into play in those European markets. There's an opportunity to do that in the future, but they are not there and they don't have the same resiliency around those mask sales. So, that sort of it's almost like a tale of two markets, if you like, on the devices versus masks during that Q4 for Europe, Asia, and rest of world.
Saul Hadassin: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just trying to understand the sequencing, I guess across the next few quarters, just as you sort of see the decline in vents and your regular CPAP business returning. I know you've talked to us, but just any sort of metrics, I know where you -- anything around production or anything like that, that might give us a bit of a sense of sort of how that's going to sequence over the next few quarters?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Andrew, this is a question that macroeconomics around the world are working on in every industry, when are we going to see as these lockdowns turn to openings and every city, every country, that we're operating in has different metrics on how fast they're opening and where they're opening. Some never closed, like Sweden. Some are opening really well like Germany, and some are going to second size shutdowns like China. And so, the best we can see as we model it, and we've got a lot of scenarios for the next fiscal year, but the best we can see is across that portfolio of 140 countries we see a sequential sort of U-shaped recovery where we start with Q1, and then we build up to Q2, Q3, Q4 through the fiscal year, as we start to see these reopening happen. We're going to expect second waves and third waves and fourth waves and the sort of W's within a particular city or particular state, but across the country level and certainly at the 140 country portfolio level, we expect that to be a U-shaped recovery, in our likely case throughout the fiscal year, and so, it all sort of turn to a world where we look at sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, and then from Q2 to Q3, and Q3 to Q4, and that's how we're sort of modeling the recovery of our sleep apnea, our COPD, and our asthma patient flow, and therefore that part of our business. There will be resiliency in the mask resupply, particularly in the U.S. geography and some other buffers that we have around our SaaS business, but that's sort of how we're looking at it on a macro basis.
Andrew Goodsall: Would you expect to return to normal by FY'22 or close to normal?
Mick Farrell: Again, Andrew, I would be a great macro economist working for a large multinational bank to make a prediction like this, and they're often wrong when they make those predictions. I think it's very difficult to say when exactly we will be back to the pre-COVID times. I did see a presentation from a global bank economist, who talked about 12 months, 24 months return to normal type period; very difficult to know. Health care, we're more resilient, people as opposed to going to retail to get a new automobile, or a new sound system, or a new home repair, they are going to their primary care physicians and their elective surgeries much quicker, and you can look on those two metrics which are pretty well-published in the major geographies, so PCP visits, GP visits, and for elective surgeries and hospital visits, and we're starting to see those metrics tick-up on a week-to-week basis. And so, the other types of analogs that we're watching and looking at, and then all the other parts come into play. Obviously, there's the upside as I talked about in the prep remarks, if there's an effective vaccine or an effective treatments to COVID-19, all bets are off, this goes to the V-shaped recovery in the markets as they get vaccinal treatment, but we've got a likely expected case of a U throughout the fiscal year, and then get back to that normal in that sort of 12 to 24-month time period.
Andrew Goodsall: Fantastic. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Malgorzata Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Brandon on for Margaret. I just wanted to go back to the vents really quick. You'd mentioned that you manufactured another 100,000 vents that can be used within the hospital. Have you sold most of these, or any of these, and is this kind of a similar situation with the prior 50,000 that they are maybe lined up for contracts already that could be recognized in the next quarter? And I'm just -- part of that is just trying to understand where vent demand is going to end-up especially since you had mentioned that Astral is still being made at full capacity, but you're expecting a steep drop-off in the next quarter. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes, Brandon, thanks for the question. Yes, certainly we're very proud of the 150,000 ventilators that we made during the first-half of the calendar year; the second-half of our fiscal year. As you know that's a very small percentage of compared to the sleep apnea devices, which are more in the sort of 2, 2.5 million on an annualized basis devices that we make across the CPAPs, IPAPs and the sleep apnea bi-levels, but look, we did obviously sell as we talked about, and Brett talked about in his remarks, we had an extra $35 million of sales in the March quarter at Q3 from ventilator, ventilator masks, and we had an extra $125 million in ventilator and ventilator mask sales in the fourth quarter, and we're not going to predict exactly what that will be here in the September quarter. We're working on hospitals, state and national bidding processes but I can tell you that the volume of bidding and the volume of processes in the sort of expected likely case of that is significantly lower here in the September quarter for that, so that that demand has gone down a lot. I mean, it's ironic in some ways, because the populations of the regions that are now impacted Brazil, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, you add up these countries and you start to get to the billions of people, I would like to see demand significantly higher, because I think humanitarian wise, we're going to need more ventilators. We have the production ready, and we are working on contracts where they're there, but we can't sell to someone who won't buy, and so as best we can see, there's going to be a pretty significant drop-off here in the September quarter on the ventilators, but at the same time, that means that the economies are opening up on the other side for our fleet business and we start to get that sequential growth back along those lines. Brett, maybe you want to add some more color on that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, the only thing I would add, Mick is there would be consistent with last quarter, there is a portion of that production that remains in inventory at June 30. So that's certainly the case. Well, as Mick said, Astral is still producing still fairly tight, and I think we will continue to do that next little while.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just trying to understand again, just the shape of recovery perhaps look at Europe and the macro wise it looks like some of the European countries have started to recover a little earlier than the U.S. Have you seen anything that could guide you to have the U.S. come out of this in Germany or France or any other countries you have been doing business?
Mick Farrell: Yes, John, it's a great question, and actually, we are looking at Germany as sort of a model of not only how to have dealt with the crisis, that country did a really good job of preparing early, they got their ventilator orders in early and they had, they never reached peak capacity in any of the major regions, cities or hospitals, and now as I recover, as I said in the prepared remarks, they north of 85% of the sleep lab capacity, they were behind the COVID Germany on home sleep apnea testing, but it really, they sort of had a leap forward on that, and I think that will move from, it was maybe 5% or 10% of diagnoses in Germany pre-COVID. I think that'll move to a solid double-digit number post-COVID, but Germany is a great model for the recovery, and it's a country right next door there in France had excellent home sleep apnea testing pre-COVID and so I think the recovery will be quite swift in France as well. You can almost look, you're asking for the analogy to the United States. Take those two countries as different regions within the U.S., Germany could be analogous to some of the states in the U.S. like mostly in the Midwest, where there's a lot of sleep apnea tests done in a sleep apnea lab and I think that will take a longer time to get to capacity just because of all the restrictions around COVID the deep cleaning and just people's psychology about turning up to a sleep lab and staying overnight versus some states, maybe like California or Massachusetts or Florida where home sleep apnea testing was more prevalent. Those not only had less of a dip during the crisis because they're able to move their patient flow to home sleep apnea test, we think they may recover faster in the patient volumes in those areas, and so, we certainly are looking at those analogs, and certainly we're sharing a learning internally here at ResMed from our Germany team, the CEO of Germany, Katrin Pucknat, she's a member of my Global CEO Operations team. So her best practices of what they're doing there brought to the global team and Jim Hollingshead and the team on the sleep and respiratory care side, and then driving that through our U.S. market with our great commercial team we have here in the U.S. and beyond, and so I'm quite confident that we're going to see a sequential quarter-to-quarter recovery throughout the fiscal year. I think we've reached the idea here in Q4 of a flow of patients globally and within our major geographies. And we're going to pick those up every quarter as we go through, I do think there's going to be second, or first waves impacting Latin America and Africa and so on. And I do hope that we're able to secure some good ventilator sales into there for now, because that will need them on a humanitarian basis, but then they will recover a little later in those geographies, but I'm pretty comfortable of our plan, likely case scenario of a steady sequential recovery, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 throughout the fiscal year, assuming no vaccine, no treatment, if those happen, it could be a significant one where you start talking about year-on-year numbers again, versus quarter-on-quarter numbers.
John Deakin-Bell: Great color. Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Bailey: Great, thanks very much. Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Brett. Just had a question in relation to the U.S. in particular on that commentary around sleep lab capacity, sort of talking to about 70% at the moment, I'm just interested in where you think that might have got to on an average basis over the year, over the June quarter, and then, perhaps any commentary might be I'll provide over that the staging over the quarter in that, you know, it was April the trough, and then improving towards June, just any commentary you can provide there would be would be appreciated?
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question, and we actually have some good information around that because we have both, you know the sort of digital end-to-end play on the sleep apnea market where we have apnea link air, which is cloud connected, honestly, that we are testing, all the way through to the obviously the air solutions platform with the air sense devices that are 100% cloud connectable as well, so we see activation rights on that weekly basis, and you picked it, we have seen during the quarter sort of that idea in that sort of late April, early May timeframe, and that we've started to see weekly increases from that idea. You see to the public data around primary care physician visits, and elective surgeries are picking up, and we also see, and without quantifying because that's sort of pretty proprietary data for ResMed, I can certainly say qualitatively to question that offer that idea in, you know, late April, early May, we have seen week-to-week increases on enhanced sleep apnea tests, but also in the activation really importantly as the market leader in market share for sleep apnea devices we're seeing activations increased from that idea point on a weekly basis and so, and we have our geography and you can see all these effects like did this or that city did that, you can see, little W shapes in some of those that have the aggregate, we're seeing that sort of steady U-shaped recovery, even in down to that granular level during the quarter and that's what gives us the confidence as we project forward into a lot of uncertainty in COVID times, 52 weeks seems like a lot of uncertainty that we think there will be that steady across the portfolio steady U-shaped recovery, but I think that's the most color I can provide you there, David.
David Bailey: Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Your next question is from David Low of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much, Mick, if I could keep on the same topic. I mean, you're talking about a U-shaped recovery, just to be really clear and simple here. We're at the bottom of that U, so effectively the first couple of quarters you'd expect, pretty low growth, not so dissimilar to what Brett talked about in terms of the low single-digit growth you're saying in July. Is that what you're saying?
Mick Farrell: Yes, exactly, David, that's exactly how I interpret the sort of classic U. So, thank you for clarifying that.
David Low: Great, thanks.
Mick Farrell: You can have a question as well if you like.
David Low: Thanks, Mick. I never want to ask you. I get in so much trouble, but I will pick you up on that. The decline that you saw in CPAP or in devices you talked about a double-digit decline. I think we had that yesterday talk about a 30% drop in new patient setup, so just wondering if I could get you or draw you little bit on sort of what level of decline you think.
Mick Farrell: Yes. So, look at that company you mentioned is particularly a U.S. focused company and so that's a pretty good analog for the double-digit decline that happened in stocks for the U.S. geography that sort of 30%, so 70% before and then picking up from that nadir as an average across the country, it would have been lower in some states that have tighter lockdowns and more sleep lab focused and less than that in some of the more liberally in terms of opening states and, but then when you look across 140 countries, you really got to say, okay, well every country treated this differently, but Germany already being up to 85% of pre-COVID, that dip wasn't that low. I don't think they got below 75%, because they were able to pivot to sleep apnea testing pretty quickly and as you know we've got a grind in that market and have great visibility. China had a very steep drop, the government there was very strict in their lockdown and that went down, very high double-digits, and has now got back up to 50% all pre-COVID towards the end of June. And so, it's almost like and we have, you could model every over 140 countries by region, by city, and then, look at a sort of computational basis of this, but it gives us confidence with that detail the last 180 days of how this has gone to project for the next 360. But yes, look for the U.S., that sort of an idea in the high 60s and maybe an average around the 70% for the quarter, but leaving at rates higher than that is sort of where we're at for that geography.
David Low: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Hashan De Silva of CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Hashan De Silva: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get some color on ventilator pricing over 4Q. How much of a benefit with ventilator pricing over 4Q, and what do you expect the price to do coming into the first quarter?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Hashan, great question. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO.
Rob Douglas: Yes, Hashan. We previously told, we actually had a policy of not trying to lift prices around this, mainly because of the whole ethics around it and making sure we were getting the ventilators in the right people's hands at the right prices. And so, we actually kept our pricing very steady through it and did slow some increased logistics cost and things like that that Brett was talking about, and we also make sure we were selling ventilators to people, who needed them immediately and were going to be using them. So we weren't selling it to stockpiles. So you can see we've had a pretty moderate approach to it, and we think it's absolutely the right approach. Obviously, the ventilators are higher price item compared to our fleet devices, and so, there was some sort of mix shift effect in our overall results, but we were very steady and our team was totally committed to making sure that we were looking after patients as a priority.
Hashan De Silva: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. Just on the gross margin, just -- I was wondering if you could give a bit more color on the outlook for that going forward. You'll have a lower proportion of ventilators, the negative mix shift, and then with the increased kind of [technical difficulty] actually expect to wake gross margin into the first quarter of '21, just any color you can give on that? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Brett, do you want to take that?
Brett Sandercock: Sure, Mick. Hi, Gretel. Yes, I mean, you've covered a few of those moving parts in the gross margin and it's probably heightened on certainly at the moment with COVID-19 and where those impacts will end. We are seeing some elevated costs rolling through, and then some of those, I think, on freight will continue for a little while. We are actively trying to mitigate that, but I think -- I mean we would get drawn in specific guidance, but I think you'd have to say -- you'd have to say there's probably not likely that we had, we'd say gross margin expansion in the short-term.
Gretel Janu: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon, Mick, Brett. Can you hear me all right?
Mick Farrell: Yes, I've got you loud and clear, Suraj.
Suraj Kalia: Perfect. So, Mick, I heard the $125 million contribution from ventilator sales in the quarter, forgive me, I was just hopping in between the calls. Can you give us the growth between North America and rest of the world in devices when you split out ventilators? Thank you for taking my question.
Mick Farrell: Suraj, that's a great question, but it gets into a level of detail that we don't want to share for competitive reasons, but look, I can give some color around it, the $125 million in ventilator sales were to the countries that during that last 90 days you [technical difficulty] have seen through the media and other contexts had the biggest impacts from COVID-19. So I think publicly, we've talked about a contract with the U.S. government and FEMA, a $32 million public contract for 2,500 or so Astral devices, and then we had some public contracts with other countries, the U.K. the National Health Service, Germany, France, Japan and Australia. I thought some that I think we've talked about in various media areas, but just given the nature of sort of the competitive dynamics, but then also some of the hospital systems and nations like to choose to publicize to their own populations, those numbers at their own rate. I don't want to go into any further detail on that, but appreciate the question Suraj, and just know that -- one thing that really made us proud is that $125 million of ventilator sales save lives, and there are tens of thousands of people, who wouldn't have been breathing with COVID-19 that were, and if their immune system was able to beat this little protein virus, when it gets in the body, they lived, and we think that was a great benefit for those countries and for those individual people and their families.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Hi, good morning. I just had one clarification, and then my question. The clarification was just with regards to the one month sales figure that Brett mentioned, being in the low single digits. Can you just give us an indication as to how much -- whether that's just pure sleep or whether it includes ventilators? And then my question really -- I wanted to add to this was with regards to competitive bidding, there's been a regard reaction I guess to try and delay the implementation, I just wonder if you had any thoughts or likelihood of that actually happening. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Great questions, Steve. Brett, if you address the first part on the clarification and then we'll have Dave to talk to competitive bidding.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, to clarify that that July group -- that's group revenue, Steve, on that. So that -- that's -- that's everything. That's the entire company.
Steve Wheen: Okay.
Mick Farrell: And with regard to your question on competitive bidding, Steve, I mean, we certainly support a delay. We were very pleased to see that just earlier this week. I believe a letter went over from over 100 members of the House and Senate urging the administration and CMS to delay competitive bidding. We've been working with other industry participants to try to advance that perspective. Obviously, there's a lot going on, and we don't get feedback from them as to whether it's likely or not, so we just have to wait and see with everyone else, but we certainly would support that. Having said that, we'll do what we can to support our customers, whenever competitive bidding does come out, so fingers crossed on that.
Operator: Your next question is from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Great. Thanks. Maybe just one question as it relates to core sleep between resupply and vents. I'm assuming, the comments are mostly on new patient starts, but maybe just a quick update on resupply. And as we move into an extended first wave, do you expect that there is sort of benefit as we saw early on in the pandemic? And then a quick follow-up on comping would just be the world rule. I know there's a push to delay that as well H.R.2771. So, just an update on where the role in of world rates for comp that exists. Thanks again.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Anthony. I'll have a go at the first part of your question, and then Dave can have a go at the second part. In terms of the numbers I was talking about -- so the double digit declines and then coming up from those nadirs during April, May, June, and then what we expect during the year that was about patient flow, sleep apnea diagnosis, COPD patient diagnosis, and coming through the channel. So directly proportional to if you like, first time setup of a sleep device and first time setup of a mask system. As you know, Anthony, you followed us for a number of years, we've got a very resilient group of patients, who loves their great sleep and loves their great breathing and they are on resupply programs either directly through retail in Australia, Singapore, U.K., or through home care programs in Europe or direct HME programs in the U.S. We saw a very good resupply rates in the March quarter, and as we just talked about, saw a very good resupply rates in the June quarter. We expect those strong resupply rates to continue through September, December and onwards. This is a -- an ongoing resupply rate that that really will be there. Obviously, first time our setups are impacted by those numbers I was talking about in the modeling, but resupply numbers have been not only equal to the year before, but sometimes a little better, and we think the some secular change, they're around the importance of respiratory medicine, the importance of respiratory health, and people just wanting clean masks, clean tubing and clean humidifiers that they -- their insurance will pay for and then they could pay the copay for or out of pocket for themselves people are paying for those. And so, we think that sort of secular change they will be there giving us a pretty resilient resupply throughout fiscal 2021 and beyond. Dave, do you want to have a go at the second part of the question about sleeping?
David Pendarvis: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Thanks for the question, Anthony. So with regard to the bill itself 2771, it remains introduced in the House. It hasn't seen a companion legislation get introduced to the Senate. Obviously, the U.S. government is preoccupied with a lot of other things that are -- they're working on now particularly trying to extend the aid. There probably will be some Medicare relief packages down the road, but we think it's an important shell of the will of Congress and sort of the sense of Congress that there ought to be relief in the rural areas. We were pleased to see that CMS has put a rule forward to advance telemedicine and telehealth reimbursement beyond the pandemic, and so, they're certainly listening to patients and providers and to Congress. We'd hope that they would listen to this and that CMS would be able to enact some relief, and it's always hazardous to predict the U.S. legislation. So, we certainly continue to support it. Many of the same congressional offices that supported 2771 were writing letters that I mentioned earlier about delaying competitive bidding. So, we think that's a strong vote, and we'd certainly continue to support it. We can't really predict what form, if any, relief will ultimately be granted. Thanks.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks, again.
Operator: Your next question is from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matthew Mishan: Hey, thank you for taking the questions. Hey, Mick, congratulations on moving to the next stages for Propeller Health. Can you give us a sense of the commercial model that you settled on, and how should we think about the revenue ramp from here?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Matt, it's a great question, and look, what I'll give is the generic revenue model of how we at Propeller -- through David Van Sickle, who's the CEO of Propeller and his commercial team globally, sort of the revenue models that they follow without giving any obviously details of any particular customer or partner. So, the general revenue models for Propeller are: number one, a development fee, there's often a development fee that we charge partners for the software engineers, who create the codes for the app that works specifically for that customer, that's a relatively monopod of the life cycle revenue, but it's there; and then secondly, we charge for the sense of the hardware that's provided each time that's sort of Propeller Sensor that has the cloud connectivity and then collects the data locally on usage adherence and other parameters; and then thirdly, which is the major part is the per activated user per month part of the revenue that is associated with that account. So then, that's really an alignment of Propeller ResMed's revenue with the pharmaceutical company, but also really importantly with the patient and their actual usage of it, and most importantly for their outcomes that they stay out of hospital longer it reduces total system costs, and so on. So, there's sort of three parts to that revenue, and all of them are in play for all of those customers that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and look, it's early days, this isn't yet material revenue for ResMed in this quarter or next quarter, but as we look over FY '21, FY '22, and certainly as we look to our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy, I think this digital health component and this recurring revenue component of medical adherence to COPD and asthma medications is going to be not only material part of our business, but a really exciting one for transforming care across the industry.
Matthew Mishan: Great. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your last question is from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Lyanne Harrison: Hi, Mick and team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get a better understanding of resupply through the June quarter. Can you share what you saw through April, May and June? I guess I'm trying to understand if there was any sort of residual panic buying at the start of the quarter, and what are you experiencing as unemployment rates increase in the United States?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Lyanne, thanks. It's a good question. Resupply was actually pretty steady through the April, May, June rates. We didn't -- year-on-year based on the cycles of where they are in the copay cycle and so on, obviously, there are double-digit unemployment numbers in the U.S. between 10% or 15% depending on the state, but in general, we have seen pretty steady resupply all of masks and accessories for customers, but Rob, do you want to provide any further color for Lyanne around the kinetics there?
Rob Douglas: Yes, sure, Mick. Lyanne, we never really saw a big panic buy issue, or we couldn't triangulate into panic buying very much at all, but there were some other things going on with the resupply programs, the people operating them, and as we saw this as well, the callouts were more likely to find people at home because they're at home, and the response to the existing programs was better, and so, we did see some solid improvement, and that sort of continued, but there's no major sort of up and down dynamic. We think it's just steady, solid progress with patients on long-term treatment need good masks, and we've got the best masks, and the best systems to keep them in treatment, and we expect that to continue through notwithstanding what else happens, given the uncertainties of COVID.
Lyanne Harrison: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Cheryl, and thanks to all of our shareholders for joining us on the call. I'd also like to once again take the opportunity to thank all 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work, not just this quarter and this year, but over the years, helping people sleep better, breathe better, and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the frontline, production, distribution, tech service, and those who help in the set-up of our ventilators and ventilation masks during this global crisis. You helped over 150,000 people potentially through those products, and I look forward to thinking you in person when this is all possible post-COVID, and we'll talk to everyone on this call in about 90 days. Thanks a lot.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly or to our general Investor Relations line. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with a transcript and a replay of today's call will be available on our Web site later today. Cheryl, you may now go ahead and close the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-04-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2020 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Diego, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Diego. Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to ResMed's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining us, and I hope you all remain healthy and safe during these times.  This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.  Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results from various remote locations across San Diego and Sydney are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock; as well as other members of management who will be available during the Q&A portion of our call. During today's call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release.  And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ, particularly in light of the highly uncertain global environment we are currently operating in and the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus on our business. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.  With that, I'd like to go ahead and now turn the call over to Mick.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you all for joining us today. These are unprecedented times, as Amy just noted. We are in the midst of a global pandemic, which is having profound effects on public health, particularly the most vulnerable among us. During this time, our top 3 goals here at ResMed are simple. Goal one is the preservation of life, helping people breathe with world-class ResMed ventilators and ventilation masks, while their own immune system fights against this novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19.  Goal two is the safety and health of our amazing team of 7,500 ResMedians, providing solutions in 140 countries worldwide, because without our people, we can't help anyone breathe better. And goal three is the ongoing delivery of world-leading products and services to treat sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as the ongoing production of market-leading software to take care of over 110 million people with care delivered by home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, hospice, and importantly, in the place where people prefer to be, their home.  I've never been more proud to call myself a ResMedian than I am today. Every one of our global team is fully engaged in the COVID-19 crisis. They are demonstrating impressive feats of ingenuity, compassion and drive to support patients, clinicians, providers, health systems and beyond. My e-mail inbox is overflowing daily with stories of ResMed heroes, including frontline workers, such as our own respiratory therapists and clinicians as well as ResMedians, who are showing up every day, using all of our updated safety procedures to source ventilator components from around the world, to produce ventilators and masks and tubing and software and deliver these life-changing solutions worldwide.  To share just one example from many is the story of a ResMed hero from our China team, actually in Wuhan, in Hubei province, who donned a full hazmat suit every day for the first 10 weeks of the corona outbreak in that region. He was setting up thousands of people on ResMed ventilators and ResMed masks, including a ventilator that we call the guardian angel or GA ventilator produced right there in China. We don't know how many lives this gentleman saved there in Hubei province, but I have the good fortune of calling him, my ResMed teammate. So to all those ResMed heroes, I say thank you and that I'm inspired by you and how you stepped up to help patients at the start of this crisis there in January and for the duration now through April and beyond. As a global company providing solutions in over 140 countries, we have mobilized our efforts and resources to address COVID-19 as this deadly disease moves from region to region. We have accelerated production and distribution of invasive ventilators, noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices as well as ventilation masks for the patients who need them most, no matter where they live.  We produced over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, including bilevels and invasive ventilators during the quarter. This is a threefold increase on our production from the same quarter in 2019, living up to the expectations that we set publicly. We have also driven a tenfold increase in our ventilation mask production, actually more than tenfold. We are aligning distribution of these ventilation products worldwide using a global ethical epidemiology-based model of ventilation needs based on our models of the surge of COVID-19 patients around the world. And our key guiding principle is the preservation of life.  We can and will do more over the coming days, weeks, months and quarters to support health care systems as COVID-19 continues to impact countries across Asia, Europe and North America and with future patient surges just starting to begin in South America, Africa, Middle East and beyond.  We have been able to achieve these outcomes while ensuring that we always place the health, safety and wellbeing of our ResMed team at the top of our priority list. Without our people, as I said earlier, we can do nothing. Our actions have included work-from-home policies for all whose job function allows for that. We have instituted noncontact temperature screening, mask wearing policies and physical distancing protocols for all of our supply chain, production, distribution and technical service teams worldwide. While we have around 65% of our global team now working from home, these important jobs such as production, distribution and tech service just can't be done from home. We have established world-class safety and quality procedures in all of our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and offices, and we're ready to get back to work as cities and countries plan to do that. Safety and quality are part of our DNA at all times. And today, more than ever, these capabilities enable us here at ResMed to support our customers with a sustainable supply of products, services and solutions throughout this COVID-19 crisis and beyond. I also want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of people beyond the boundary of ResMed, especially the frontline health care workers in hospitals worldwide. Respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, critical care doctors and many others have demonstrated extraordinary leadership and personal sacrifice at this time. These clinicians are triaging people with symptoms into various therapeutic pathways depending on the changing acuity of each individual with this novel coronavirus from CPAP therapy to bilevel therapy, to more advanced noninvasive ventilation as well as to full endotracheal intubation with invasive ventilation for the patients who need that.  These clinicians are using ResMed ventilators and ResMed ventilation masks with direct person-to-person engagement, which even with full personal protective equipment still includes significant risk for that clinician. We are working with customers worldwide to drive digital pathways to try to minimize unneeded person-to-person interaction. Examples of this include remote monitoring of ventilation devices, telehealth solutions and virtual patient population management. We have over 11 million devices with available connectivity to our cloud-based solutions, including myAir and AirView. We have over 13 million patients as well as over 6 billion nights, 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud.  We had a running start in the field of digital health well before this COVID-19 crisis. One of the few positive benefits out of this awful crisis is that it has brought to the forefront the importance of digital health for the health and safety of respiratory therapists, respiratory nurses and critical care physicians. Digital health also brings benefits of more scalability, more cost efficiency and better outcomes for patients. Throughout the quarter, despite all the changes brought by this coronavirus, we have continued to execute on our long-term ResMed 2025 strategy, including digital health, expanding end-to-end pathways for sleep apnea, for COPD and for asthma as well as building the world's best out-of-hospital health care software network. Fundamentally, we believe and continue to believe, through this crisis even more so, that the future of health care is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where ResMed wins today.  The COVID-19 pandemic has proved an interesting point. The more we can establish noncontact digital health pathways at scale, the better the health of therapists, nurses and physicians and the better the efficacy, the efficiency, the scale and the quality of care for patients. We have accelerated our ability to improve over 250 million lives in outside-the-hospital health care by 2025. The fundamentals of our ResMed business is strong, even as we see uncertainty in the changing kinetics and dynamics of the COVID-19 disease as it continues to move across geographies, from Asia to Europe, to now North America and on to South America, Africa and regions worldwide. We are seeing tailwinds in our business from increased demand of our ventilators such as Astral, Stellar, Lumis as well as our noninvasive ventilators, AirCurve, Flexo and the GA. We are also seeing increased demand for ventilation mask solutions.  We do not know exactly how long the surge of demand will last for each hospital, for each city, for each country and for each region as this COVID-19 virus moves. But as patient flow surges, peaks and then flattens, we are there. And we are getting pretty good at modeling these demand curves using our global COVID-19 epidemiology model of patient flow and the learning from each city that we serve. Currently, a lot of short-term impact also depends on our ability to keep ventilator production at its maximum capacity. And as I mentioned earlier, we are already at 3x last year's production capacity. And we are doing our best to meet the surge and peak flow in multiple geographies worldwide. A key element is -- in our ability to deliver is our ability to source critical components and ship product in response to the incredible demand as this COVID-19 virus moves around the world.  I want to be clear on this point, though. Even as we face increased demand for our products, we are doing everything that we can to keep efficiency high and to keep our costs down. Our primary humanitarian goal is 100% locked. At ResMed, we are committed to enabling access to ventilators for COVID-19 patients in order to preserve life. We are keeping pricing steady, and we will not opportunistically increase prices or per unit profit in our response to COVID-19.  We believe that there will be lessons learned during the crisis that will enhance our ability here at ResMed to drive innovation in the coming quarters, coming years through our research and development pipeline, particularly in the fields of digital health technology as well as our product and software innovation. We are very competitively positioned in these fields today, but we think we will be even more so tomorrow.  While balancing our response to the global public health crisis, we have also been executing well in our core business. We have delivered strong growth in our sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across geographies, with solid contributions from our software-as-a-service business during the quarter. In a few minutes, our CFO, Brett Sandercock, will provide the details of our third quarter financial performance, along with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2020. But first, I'll provide just a few financial highlights and briefly discuss execution towards our ResMed 2025 strategy along with some milestones for the quarter. So for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we delivered just around $770 million in quarterly revenue, which is up 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth and positive momentum across our product portfolio, software solutions and global markets. As part of our global COVID-19 response, we have seen tailwinds for the increased demand for invasive ventilators and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel devices, masks and accessories, as I mentioned earlier. We estimate the incremental impact to be approximately $35 million of COVID-19-related revenue during the quarter. So from this $770 million in quarterly revenue, we generated a strong $240 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, enabling us to return cash dividends to shareholders, as declared by our Board today.  We continue to invest in the future growth of our enterprise with double-digit increases in our research and development investments during the quarter. This R&D investment includes shifting resources to ventilators and ventilation masks and clinical research and technical help people to help clinicians, physicians, inventors and people worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis as well as keeping the ongoing innovation work going for our core sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service businesses.  We have set a clear path for ResMed to maintain our position as the global leader in digital health technology, transforming the way health care is delivered for those suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma as well as enabling people to live healthier lives in a portfolio of settings away from the hospital. The execution of our long-term strategy drives progress against our triple aim of: first, slowing chronic disease progression; second, reducing overall health care system costs; and third, improving the quality of life for our ultimate customer, the person who uses our products, to help them sleep better, breathe better and deliver higher quality of life away from the hospital.  We believe that when we help a person sleep better, breathe better and live a better quality of life away from acute care, this positions ResMed to help those people achieve their best health outcome in other chronic disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. We are forming multiple partnerships to drive these long-term health benefits, including our joint venture with Verily and many other private partnerships beyond. Watch this space. We have three priorities that guide our daily focus. Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. That's just our clear #1 priority. Number two, to deliver world-leading medical devices and digital health technology to engage physicians, providers and patients so that together, we can improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs and enhance patient experiences. That's our triple aim. And our third priority is to build the world's best software solutions network for health care that is delivered outside the hospital, and we're well on track to do that.  We have advanced on all 3 of these priorities during the quarter, and I'll briefly touch on a few recent highlights to demonstrate areas where we have momentum and are driving innovation. We had an exceptionally strong growth this quarter on a geographic and product basis, including 17% growth globally. Our team delivered strong and distributed geographic growth, including a 12% increase in the combined United States, Canada and Latin America regions as well as an incredibly strong constant currency increase of 27% across the combined Europe, Asia and other regions. As discussed earlier, there was an impact from the COVID-19 surge in demand of ventilation in the quarter of around $35 million in revenue, so that's around 4.5% of the $770 million in revenues for the quarter. In short, our core underlying business remained robust, over and above that of the ongoing surge of demand. On a product basis, during the last 12 months, we improved over 16 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a ResMed complete mask system to help them breathe better and live a better life. Including our digital health solutions for out-of-hospital software in this number, we impacted together over 110 million lives during these last 12 months. The ability to improve these lives is supported by over 6 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud. These data allow us to perform sophisticated data analytics and to drive actionable insights for the benefit of customers, including patients, physicians, providers and health care systems. This makes ResMed the global leader in digital health for our field and the partner of choice for our customers, helping them increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve outcomes. So shifting to a discussion of our core sleep apnea business. We are seeing significant impact from the COVID-19-related lockdowns on new patient diagnoses in sleep. We have seen double-digit declines in diagnosis rates in affected markets. Many sleep clinics, especially hospital clinics are temporarily closed. And many pulmonary and critical care physicians that often work in sleep clinics are shifting their focus to treat COVID-19 patients as the surge comes to their city, their region, their state, their hospital. It is important to note that we have seen the mask and accessories resupply dimension of our business not only maintained, but actually increased during the quarter.  As we look forward, there is uncertainty and it's not clear to what extent the upsurge in ventilation device and ventilation mask revenue will offset the decline in sleep device revenue and whether sleep mask revenue will maintain its growth or decelerate somewhat. But we know these facts, number one, the sleep apnea prevalence remains incredibly high, over 936 million people worldwide. And we know, fact two, that there is a backlog of diagnostic activity for sleep apnea and COPD that many clinics and physicians are preparing to ramp up their home sleep apnea testing, both now during the crisis and in the future as lockdowns are lifted around the world.  For the on-premise or in-laboratory tests for sleep apnea, we are modeling how those will scale back up again customer-by-customer, city-by-city and country-by-country as the economy opens up and primary care physician visits and elective medical procedures come back online through telehealth and beyond. Physicians and therapists will then have to work through the backlog of undiagnosed patients that has been built through the COVID-19 lockdown in their region, with a portfolio of both home sleep apnea testing and in-lab tests.  The velocity of the diagnostic pathway return rate will depend on local regulations and behaviors and what we're calling a new normal for patient care. We have real-time experience of the opening back up in some cities in Asia and throughout Europe, and we're starting to see them open up in the U.S. And we have modeled these open-ups carefully to ensure that we can best support customers as they start their home sleep apnea test scale and their in-lab test scale over time to meet the backlog of demand. Even today, around the world, we're working closely with our customers to accelerate these home sleep apnea testing models and remote patient setup on sleep apnea therapy where customers are pursuing those pathways as well as our ongoing remote sleep apnea patient monitoring. And I mentioned earlier, we have over 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices out there in the field and more that are distributed every day.  It's important to note that these types of partnerships aren't new due to COVID-19. These are things we've been working on for years and decades in some states. And we believe these types of digital health and telehealth and remote monitoring models will only increase due to COVID-19 and as we move into a post-COVID-19 world.  In terms of digital health innovation, we have recently rolled out a new pilot telehealth over video chat so that the physician can not only access information on Air Solutions and AirView, but it can also interact directly with the patient. And we think that will reduce the need for a recovered COVID-19 patient to return to the emergency room or a physician outpatient setting. We view this as a trend that will be accelerated by a combination of changes in reimbursement methodologies and overall focus on safety and the preventative and health benefits for both the patient and the health care worker.  Solutions like this can provide incredible scale when leveraged across a digital health network, including over 110 million patient lives. As I noted earlier, our investments in research and development grew by double digits in the quarter, and we put these R&D monies to work to expedite the tripling of ventilator production in the quarter and tenfold capacity increase in our ventilation mask production. We have also formed partnerships with clinicians around the world to help with the COVID-19 crisis, to help create and share clinical white paper, best practice solutions in clinical practice to help with COVID-19 ventilation management, including triage between CPAP, oxygen, bilevel therapy, noninvasive ventilation therapy and invasive ventilation therapy. At the same time, though, we have continued to invest in our core businesses for future growth in sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and software-as-a-service.  As an example of this innovation in our core sleep apnea business, we introduced during the quarter the AirFit F30i. This is the first CPAP mask with a tube-up design in the full face category. This product now gives ResMed the most complete full face mask portfolio versus all our competition on the planet. So what does this tube-up design of the AirFit F30i do for customers? In essence, it gives the freedom of movement back to that ultimate customer, the patient, so they can sleep naturally in any position. The best lumber architecture follows during the night. The F30i also has an innovative cushion that prevents irritation on the nasal bridge, and it has a quick release elbow that allows users to quickly disconnect and reattach the mask from its tubing, making it very simple to start therapy at the start of the night and to stop therapy in the morning.  All this technology built into the AirFit F30i supports the third tenet of our triple aim, to improve the quality of life for the patient. If they have freedom of movement and don't wake up, that improves their sleep, it improves their day, it improves their life. Clearly, it is very early in the product life cycle for the F30i, and this product was launched amid a pretty unique global environment. However, despite some of the noise in the signal, we've been able to see good early acceptance as physicians, respiratory therapists and that ultimate customer, the patient, recognize the benefit and functionality of the innovation in the F30i.  Additionally, during the quarter, we invested $100,000 in partnership with the not-for-profit American Thoracic Society Foundation through a research grant. The goal of the research and the study is to look at how remote monitoring can help improve the management of patients with COPD. The study aims to detect early changes in lung function from daily recordings and to notify patients and/or physicians when to commence more intensive treatment or to seek high-level medical attention.  Nearly 400 million people suffer from COPD worldwide, and we do not believe these people are well served currently by global health care systems. Our vision of better management for COPD patients through the use of digital health technologies will be accelerated from the findings of this study. It's great to partner with the nonprofit ATS Foundation to help this move forward.  As we discussed earlier, COVID-19 has accelerated the movement to fully remote care in our core sleep apnea and ventilation businesses. Looking at our growing digital health solutions for COPD and asthma, the Propeller platform continues to play an important role in keeping patients outside the hospital, out of acute care locations, leveraging the Propeller's world-leading pharmaceutical adherence technology for these diseases.  Active use of Propeller technology has actually increased during the COVID-19 crisis. We think this is due to the rising awareness of the importance of respiratory health and the fact that people just don't want to go to acute care settings, and so they're using preventative medicines more to do so. While it's not yet material to ResMed's overall revenue, we are seeing increased interest in Propeller's technology to support health systems with population health. We'll keep you updated on any significant milestones with our pharmaceutical partners as well as our work with global health care system partners throughout calendar year 2020 and 2021 as they adopt the Propeller platform for COPD, asthma and beyond.  Before I transition to a discussion of our out-of-hospital software-as-a-service business, I'd like to recap briefly why we believe that the SaaS business is critical to ResMed's long-term success and how it fits into our broader portfolio. Our consistent view of the evolution of the health care system is that care will be delivered outside the hospital. The contamination of hospitals with COVID-19 is just one of the latest examples of the types of contagions that are present in many hospital locations worldwide. Our vision is to enable a system where a patient can seamlessly transfer across a portfolio of outside hospital care settings, from home care providers to skilled nursing facilities, to home health, to independent living, assisted senior living and beyond. These settings have reduced costs versus the hospital as well as increased efficiency and better health outcomes than the hospital. People are simply happier and healthier in the residential setting of their choice, and the ultimate residence of choice is their home.  The SaaS business clearly leverages the global trend for seniors to want to age in place and supports ResMed's continued execution against the triple aim. Our SaaS businesses enable us to participate more deeply in broader chronic disease across a patient's life cycle, creating additional strategic growth options. During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew at 12% from the period a year ago. We are integrating and optimizing this out-of-hospital SaaS portfolio to support long-term growth. We continue to believe that the long-term weighted average growth of the SaaS markets that we serve is in the high single digits. We clearly beat that growth this quarter, and we plan to exceed that rate in the long run as we execute to our SaaS strategy. During the COVID-19 crisis, many out-of-hospital health care settings have switched their use to support overflow from hospitals. And there has also been a reduction in patient flow to these out-of-hospital facilities due to a reduction in elective surgeries at hospitals. Skilled nursing facilities and nursing home volumes have been extremely hard hit by COVID-19, and this will impact our MatrixCare business growth in the coming quarters. We expect market growth in our current portfolio of SaaS businesses that we serve to be in the mid single-digit range for the next few quarters, before its recovery to high single-digit growth in the medium to long term as the COVID-19 surge passes and people return to their primary care physicians and return to their elective surgeries and patient volume returns. In support of the increased growth of the SaaS portfolio, during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply for our HME customers. The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx tech creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation for HME customers. Resupply is an area of the HME business that has been a strong ballast in the boat during the COVID-19 lockdowns. And these types of programs, including Brightree and SnapWorx together, set up our customers for ongoing success and better patient engagement through the crisis and beyond. In summary, the SaaS portfolio is an important driver of our long-term success and a critical enabler of our ability to impact our triple aim. We are investing for long-term growth in SaaS and leadership in this space.  Our performance across the entire ResMed portfolio during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our business during, what I would call, extremely challenging global times. And it highlights the dedications of ResMedians all over the world and the dedication of our customers, the clinicians, providers and health systems to deliver for the people who need our help. Looking forward, we are modeling impacts of headwinds and tailwinds from the COVID-19 crisis, with detailed scenarios of impacts by customer, by city, by region and by business line. While we face temporary headwinds in sleep apnea diagnosis and SaaS patient business flows I just talked about, we are also seeing tailwinds from increased demand for our ventilation devices, our ventilation masks around the world. The fundamentals of our overall business is strong, but these are uncertain times and the crisis continues to unfold across geographies, and we don't know exactly how long the related headwinds and the related tailwinds will last. We don't know specifically by each city, country and region how fast they will open up, but we know they will open up. And as we have seen in Asia and Europe, as these economies open up over the coming days, weeks and months, ResMed will be there to serve them. And we know one thing that as they start to open up, there has been and will be a backlog of patients who need the channel's help for sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and out-of-hospital health care needs. We're investing now to be ready for those realities of the open-up so that we can be there to support our customers with the best digital health solutions and the most scalable solutions to help them grow now. We are leading from the front.  The nature of the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of our digital health strategies I mentioned earlier. Our ability to improve over 250 million lives by 2025 in out-of-hospital health care is not only on track, we think it's accelerated these last 3 months. This is the one welcome benefit in what has been incredibly challenging 90 days for every company, not just ResMed in every nation, every government dealing with this crisis. We're glad that we have made extensive investments in remote monitoring, remote patient setup, digital health, population health management over the last 5, 10-plus years that we can now offer and bring to the market to help them when they need it.  The combination of accelerated digital health technology and the recognition of the value of remote monitoring and the projected changes that are already happening in global reimbursement models for digital health, combined with the growing acceptance of virtual diagnosis and virtual setup, represents a new and significant medium to long-term tailwind for the ResMed business. This combined with our strong pipeline of new products and digital health solutions, including sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and the out-of-hospital SaaS gives us strong confidence in our future. We think this is a unique positioning that solidifies our leadership role in global digital health in med tech, but will also support ResMed's growth over the medium to long term. Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I'd like to commit that while we have already played a significant role providing tens of thousands of ventilators, many, many more ventilation masks and clinical support to clinicians worldwide to fight the COVID-19 crisis, we are not done. We will do even more in the coming quarter and the coming quarters to deliver more ventilators, more ventilation masks for countries as they go through the patient surge. And we will be there to support health care systems around the world in respiratory medicine and digital health not only during this COVID-19 crisis, but in what we call the new normal post-COVID-19 world that will be more digitally enabled and more digitally connected than ever before.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and some remarks for our Q4 outlook. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $769 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues for the third quarter were favorably impacted by significant sales of ventilator devices and accessories. We estimate that the incremental revenue benefit from COVID-19-related sales was in the order of $35 million. Excluding this incremental impact, our group revenue increased by 12% in constant currency terms. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin America countries were $394 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $286 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 27% increase.  By product segment, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $196 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $197 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales totaled $195 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 29% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets were $91 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, a 22% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, both device sales and masks and other sales increased by 18% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-service revenue for the third quarter was $90 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, SaaS revenue increased by 9%.  During my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue and an impairment of minority interest investments. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.  Our non-GAAP gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 60% in the March quarter compared to 59.3% in the same quarter last year. The increase is predominantly attributable to favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $172 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7% compared to the prior year period. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 22.4% compared to 24.8% reported in the prior year quarter. Given the volatility in potential future revenue outcomes, I will not provide our normal guidance with respect to SG&A as a percentage of revenue. However, looking forward, we expect SG&A expenses to increase in the low single digits compared to the year ago period. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.7% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. We continue to invest in our business, particularly targeted at innovation. This is evidenced by the double-digit growth in R&D expenses in Q3. We believe our long-term commitment to innovation will deliver a sustained competitive advantage.  Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses to continue to grow in the high single digits to low double digits, reflecting our commitment to innovation through the economic cycles. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was $20 million of the quarter, a decrease of 10% over the prior year quarter, reflecting historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $238 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong top line growth, expansion of gross margin and well-managed operating expenses. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we still continue to experience solid operating leverage. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million, an increase of 47% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 14.9%, while on a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%.  Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 will be in the range of 18% to 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 impacts, we estimate our diluted earnings per share were $1.16, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.12. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized write-downs of $9 million associated with minority equity investments. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $240 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $30 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $46 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $56 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of our previously announced tuck-in acquisition of SnapWorx. The acquisition will be non-GAAP EPS neutral in year 1 and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in year 2. However, overall, the impact will not be material to group earnings. We recorded equity losses of $5 million in our income statement in the March quarter associated with the Verily joint venture. We expect to record an underlying run rate of approximately $5 million of equity losses each quarter through fiscal year 2021, associated with the joint venture operations.  Given the unprecedented nature of current events, I would like to make some comments on our financial health. Strong balance sheet has always been a hallmark of ResMed and is most valued by investors in times of economic uncertainty. We ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $353 million, having generated $240 million in operating cash flow during the third quarter and $472 million in the first 9 months of our fiscal year 2020. As of March 31, we have $1.4 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. We had total assets of $4.5 billion. Our debt levels remain modest. And at March 31, we had a further $895 million available for drawdown under our existing revolver facility.  In summary, our liquidity position is strong. However, I also want to highlight that in these times of uncertainty, we are maintaining a disciplined approach, and we are tightly managing expenses, cash flow and liquidity. Today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. Dividends are important to many of our shareholders, and the declaration of our dividend reflects the Board's confidence in our strong liquidity position and operating performance.  Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. At a high level, we expect to see continued strong growth in our respiratory care business and expect incremental respiratory care revenue to significantly exceed in Q3. However, we expect to see a headwind in sleep device sales in Q4 in response to a temporary reduction in the diagnosis of new patients. Masks and accessories have shown resiliency over the past 3 months, which reflects the insulating value of the large patient installed base. Like many other companies, we are experiencing high uncertainty in the current environment with circumstances and information changing almost on a daily basis. And as a result, our forecast and possible future revenue outcomes remain dynamic.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. [Operator Instructions]. Diego, we're now ready for the Q&A portion.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. 
Lyanne Harrison: Congratulations on a great result. I'm very interested in, I guess, the uplift that you did on ventilators, and you maybe mentioned you got $35 million tailwind for this quarter due to the threefold increase in the devices production [indiscernible] in ventilators by far. Can you tell me whether or not you are able to increase your volume of production of ventilators as you go through quarter 4 and to meet any increased demand in other countries.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Lyanne. Thanks for the question. And yes, you're right. We had 2 separate metrics that we sort of laid out there. One that we sold an extra $35 million worth of ventilator in the quarter. Those were from our inventory and stuff that we produced in Q2 and some in Q3 and so that was a $35 million tailwind for our business, and we expect some of that certainly to continue as the surge continues worldwide into Q4. And then in addition to that, we tripled our production from a year ago, and we made over 52,000 noninvasive ventilators, bilevel devices and invasive ventilators.  So your question of, can we continue and/or increase the production capacity? And the answer is absolutely yes. We are constrained on some key components for the invasive ventilators. So the Astral and Stellar have some significant constraints in the components that go into those invasive ventilators of the Astral and Stellar type products. Well, Astral is an invasive ventilator and Stellar is actually noninvasive ventilator. But we really don't have significant constraints to the Lumis STA other than some components around the alarms module and the extra components and the AirCurve ST. So those noninvasive ventilators can scale to 5x or 10x, and we can really scale to whatever the demand is. And so then it comes down to our ability to predict hospital-by-hospital, customer-by-customer, what those surges in demand are going to be as the virus moves around the world and to make sure that ResMed is there, getting an order and making sure we can deliver those invasive ventilators, but really importantly, those noninvasive ventilators and alternative therapies that are also used in the different levels of acuity for a patient with COVID-19. So the answer in short is, absolutely. We did all we could, and we tripled production in the quarter, and we are looking to do that and more in Q4 to deliver for the needs that continue worldwide.
Lyanne Harrison: Okay. So just to clarify, [indiscernible]. How much can you increase production on the ventilators [indiscernible].
Michael Farrell: I am going to say, Lyanne, the audio wasn't fantastic during that, but I think I heard you say that how would we or how fast would we move from the sort of 3x increases to a 5x or 10x on AirCurve ST, that's going to be dependent upon our modeling of the different surges that happen city-by-city and country-by-country. And clearly, the masks are used far more rapidly because they are changed over pretty regularly certainly patient-to-patient, but often day-to-day with these non-vented ventilation masks. And so we expect the surge to continue and us to continue to be able to produce throughout Q4 and beyond for the needs as this goes -- as this virus goes around the world and continues to expand.
Lyanne Harrison: So my question was, how much can we increase the ventilator masks [indiscernible]
Michael Farrell: Yes, I've got to say, I can't -- I think I heard you say, can we increase the ventilation mask production? We've increased it tenfold, and we'll continue to do so. I think we should go to the next question. Sorry, Lyanne.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities.
Suraj Kalia: I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Mick, just one from my side. And forgive me if you all mentioned this. Can you help characterize your investment in Nyxoah. You all are thinking about the neuromod market specifically for sleep apnea? What is the construct of ResMed's investment? That will be greatly appreciated.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. It's a great question. And as you know, you followed our stock for a long time. We look at a portfolio of investments to treat sleep apnea. And around 10 years ago, we actually invested in the 3D printing of a sleep apnea dental device called Narval, and that's now a great part of our portfolio and treats a great number of patients in France and across Northern Europe. The neurostimulation market is an interesting one and Nyxoah, we think, is a leader in that space, and we decided to make a minority equity investment in them. I'll actually hand over to Jim Hollingshead, who's the President of our Global Sleep business, to talk about how neurostim, dental, CPAP and how it all fits together.
James Hollingshead: Thanks, Mick. Just very briefly, since I know we're probably short on time now. The gold standard therapy for sleep apnea continues to be CPAP therapy. And that -- we think that will continue for the foreseeable future. We get a chance to see a wide range of technologies as they emerge. And we always look very carefully at anything we think is an alternative. And as Mick mentioned, we obviously have a fantastic oral device, which we sell in Europe very successfully. The Narval device, high-tech, 3D printed, very low volume of the mouth, very comfortable. We've looked at the neurostim space for quite a long time. There have been a number of companies that have tried to succeed in the neurostim space. We think Nyxoah has a novel offer and is potentially disruptive, but it's very early days. It's a minority investment in what's effectively a start-up company. So we like the technology. We like to play, but we'll have to see how it plays out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Cooper: Mick, can you just remind us of the approximate payer mix in the sleep apnea business, please? And I appreciate this is a highly dynamic situation, but can you just share your thoughts on how you expect the higher rates of unemployment we're seeing in the U.S. to impact that business, please?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, certainly, every country around the world is different. I presume you're asking about the U.S. payer mix, Chris? Maybe you're on mute, but I'll start with the U.S.
Chris Cooper: Okay, primarily, year-on-year.
Michael Farrell: Okay. So obviously, we sell in 140 countries outside the U.S. and on the reimbursed part of our business, the non-SaaS part, it's close to that 60-40 range, 60% being within the U.S. and 40% being beyond that. And if you include SaaS businesses, it's more like 65% of our global business in the U.S. So I'll start with that. So we don't have contracts directly with payers, but our portfolio of home medical equipment customers do. And there's around 5,000 customers in the U.S home medical equipment providers, and their payer mix for the field of sleep apnea and COPD that we serve is around 20%, maybe 25% for some regions, Medicare; and around 75%, 80%, private pay.  And as we've seen through the COVID-19 crisis, we have seen ongoing payments from the -- both the government and private payers through to ResMed. We are carefully watching our accounts receivable. And as Brett said, we're carefully watching our cash flow to make sure that payers pay on time and with time, but we haven't seen any issues as yet. Clearly, unemployment has increased in the country from single digits to double digits through this crisis, and it's something that all companies are looking at very carefully. But we haven't seen any issues as yet, but we are watching the cash flow very carefully to make sure that we have continuing flow of capital and cash through our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham and Company.
Michael Matson: So I guess first, I just wanted to ask about the resupply business. Wondering why you think that, that's been so strong? Is there any kind of demand pull forward happening there? Do you think that can be sustained as long as the pandemic continues?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And certainly, there's -- it's quite interesting. As you know, you've followed us for a long time, too, Mike. Our installed base of CPAP patients, sleep apnea patients is a very strong part of our mask business. We're talking north of 80-plus percent of our masks sales across the U.S. are to that installed base, the diagnosed patient who loves their therapies, changed their life and they're going to go and reorder every time. I think the focus of COVID-19, and that it's a respiratory medical issue and that has raised the importance of making sure that your lungs are well taken care of and that you breathe well and your overall health is well, has increased people to make sure they get their prescriptions for everything, including heart attack. Post heart attack patients are getting more prescription pills. As I noted earlier, the Propeller side, COPD medicines and asthma medicines, we're seeing increased use of those in respiratory medical health.  And we've seen a similar thing, I think, in the CPAP mask side, where when you are capable of getting a mask, you are more likely to click, yes, I would like that. And we haven't seen any reduction in people saying, "Oh the co-pay is too high or I don't want to go there." We've seen actually the reverse where people are saying, "wow, it's been 90 days, I'm due for a therapy, for a CPAP mask, tubing, et cetera." And they're clicking yes, and they're getting those devices delivered to them. So very strong ballast in the boat for our HME customers. And the HME customers themselves are really focusing on this part of their business because it's a good opportunity for them. We think -- look, there will be some deceleration if there is some sort of that surge of the sort of the toilet paper model where I'm going to over inventory, you all going to make sure I've got enough masks. That might decelerate somewhat, but we don't think -- we think there's a lot of ballast in that. And people who are on CPAP therapy and loving the CPAP therapy are going to want to get new masks. And through COVID and beyond, the importance of respiratory medicine will only be increased because of this. So we think that part of that business is very steady through the crisis and even stronger beyond. I think it will change behaviors that will last well beyond COVID-19 surge.
Michael Matson: Okay. And then just with regard to sleep diagnostic testing. Can you provide any more detail around the declines that you're seeing kind of late in the March quarter? And then to what degree could increased use of home testing kind of some sort of remote telemedicine model offset that? And are you doing anything to try to enable the CPAPs to implement -- to ramp up, I guess, their home sleep testing?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Great follow-up question, Mike. And we're doing a lot in that space. I'm focused a lot with Rob Douglas on our global task force on COVID-19 and ventilators. Jim Hollingshead, at the same time, has been running our sleep business strongly. Jim, do you want to follow up on the -- follow-up there on home sleep apnea testing and scale?
James Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks, Mick. I think it's very difficult to quantify the effects and the balances of decline in in-lab testing and increase of home sleep testing in general. And it's very different country by country, both because of the timing of the pandemic and then how different health care systems are structured and so on. So trying to get a quantification, I think, is quite difficult. What we do know is we have seen some decline in in-lab testing. That's not a surprise. Health care systems around the world have shifted their focus to COVID-19. Many countries have gone in lockdown. Much of the U.S. has gone in lockdown. So we know that in-lab testing has declined and dipped.  We have some evidence to suggest it stabilized at a lower level. It's hard to know exactly what that level is, but we think it's potentially stabilized at this point. But in parallel, we also know there's been an increase in home sleep testing and remote testing. A number of the labs around the U.S. have increased their use of home sleep testing devices and routines. And where that's done in Europe and can be down in Europe, it continues to be done, and we think it will turn on faster in Europe. And then the final point of your question is what are we doing? We're actually working very hard to enable home sleep testing to figure out how to help our lab customers and our physician customers virtualize their model, not just to our device offerings, but through workflows, through webinars and trainings, and we're working hard to see if we can virtualize some of that with software, which will take a little bit more time. And we do think that a shift to home sleep testing is, which has been going on worldwide for years, will be accelerated by this.  And just as Mick said in his prepared comments, one of the things that we think will come out of the crisis generally for the sleep business is increased adoption of our already very broad offerings, virtualized care offerings. And so we think that will accelerate through the crisis and then have a new normal coming out of the crisis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.
Malgorzata Kaczor: Just wanted to follow up on the comment you guys have on production of NIVs and LSVs. I think I heard you guys say you've produced 52,000 of those devices in the quarter, which I know you guys don't give ASPs, but it seems like it could be $200 million or $300 million worth of products in the device side versus the $35 million benefit you saw in the quarter. So I guess, long and short, but the question is, were those made-to-order or in advance of demand? And how should we think about that product entering the field?
Michael Farrell: Margaret, that's a great question. And yes, certainly, we did -- you heard correctly. We made 52,000 noninvasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. So that includes everything across the Astral, Stellar, Lumis, Flexo, GA and AirCurve, all those devices. So we included across all that group, 52,000, and they have very different pricing. But clearly, it's a lot more than just the $35 million of sales in that quarter. So we are prepared for demand ahead. The only thing I'm really willing to say on a public call like this is that we have a public capability with the U.S. government through HHS and FEMA of over $30 million contract. And so that's a fixed contract that we will fulfill, mostly in Astrals.  And -- but we have many other contracts with hospitals, states, governments, nations around the world. I'm not going to go in and quantify any of those. They're usually one to one directly to those countries and directly to those hospitals. But what I can tell you is all the demand that they have and all the supply that we have, our supplies just cannot keep up with the demand as it moves around the world. And so what we're doing is maximizing production in advance and then making sure we get through the peak and through the surge, but not have an over amount of inventory at the other side. And so we're carefully managing the peak, the surge, the flattening and then making sure we get back to normal COPD, neuromuscular disease, ALS and other sales with those ventilators because those patients will be there beyond. And that's how we're looking at it, Margaret. But yes, clearly, we are preparing for more sales in the future of those ventilators and ventilation masks. That -- those tailwinds will last through Q4 and likely beyond.
James Hollingshead: Yes. I'll just add quickly, Mick. Margaret, yes, there's a lot -- there's a meaningful amount that's in transit mode so to speak, as we're trying to get those into our DCs and then ultimately to customers. So there's that -- that impacts it as well. So -- but we'll continue to produce. And as Mick said, the demand is there. It's just a matter of getting it through the logistics.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners.
Steven Wheen: I just had a question on the FDA in terms of its response to COVID-19. It was alluding to the use of CPAP as being something that could be utilized. Just wondered what the experience was there? And then the other item that the FDA had done was to remove ventilators from the competitive bidding process. I just -- and there has -- appears to be some pressure to delay competitive bidding in the latest round. Just any comments on any of those 3 things would be very useful.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Steve, those are great questions. And I've had actually quite a lot of conference calls with the FDA commissioner, Hahn; and HHS secretary, Azar, during this crisis. ResMed was part of a Defense Production Act that was put in place by the White House to secure component supply for our ventilator so that we could supply HHS, FEMA and beyond. And so I had a lot of interaction there. Look, the FDA have really been a great partner through this process. They helped us get Emergency Use Authorization, EUA, for a number of our products to be used in different context. So for instance, our noninvasive ventilators, which were very scalable. And as we talked about, we made tens of thousands this quarter. We had doctors wanting to use them in various ways, invasive ways and others. And so the doctors needed an EUA to be able to do that, and they have got that. And the FDA were very quick to us and other manufacturers in providing those Emergency Use Authorizations.  Simultaneously, Secretary, Azar, over at Health and Human Services and CMS, they did take noninvasive ventilators out of competitive bidding around 2021, and that was a very good change for our HME customers. It really took a load off for them knowing that these NIV and ventilation businesses will be good ongoing concerns for them. So we saw a good partnership from both the FDA and HHS as part of this crisis. And HHS also worked with FEMA to make sure that we got the demand, and that was the $30-plus million contract I talked about to us, and there were 5 other manufacturers who got contracts as well. I think the government, not just in the U.S., but in all 100-plus countries that we're working with through this crisis, have done a great job in contacting us, working with us, helping us with supply chains and helping us with delivery of ventilators to people in the need for this crisis.
Steven Wheen: And sorry, the final part was just the pressure that's being or the attempt to delay competitive bidding, the likelihood of that?
Michael Farrell: Yes. I'll hand that over to Dave. He's got more insight on that, David Pendarvis?
David Pendarvis: Yes. So thanks, Steve. We, along with the rest of the industry, have been suggesting to CMS that they either delay for a year the introduction of the 2021 round entirely or at least the respiratory offerings, respiratory product codes within that offering of the 2021 round of competitive bidding. We have had a dialogue with CMS on that topic, so they are listening. But I can't really handicap the likelihood that it will happen or not. I would echo what Mick said earlier, that CMS has been very responsive, and I think it has highlighted the importance of DME and home-based care in ensuring that as few people are in the hospital is not. And that's a real positive. And we hope that, that cooperative working relationship will continue.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan.
David Low: Mick, can I just follow-up on the use of bilevel device to treat COVID-19 patients. I mean there's clearly the aerosol issue and the safety issue there. I have seen some efforts to overcome that. Do you think that's going to be on -- I mean -- and I heard your comments, excuse me, about the amount of manufacturing capacity you have. Is your expectation that there will be continued strong demand for that utilization model?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Look, it's a great question, David. And certainly, through this crisis, one of the leading countries early on this was the U.K. and the National Institute -- the National Health Service there, the NHS. And they created a protocol, which looked at the various acuity levels of COVID-19 patient because the disease -- the coronavirus gets into the lungs and then causes the COVID-19 disease, which is where mucus builds up as the alveoli react and try to fight off the virus, and it creates mucus in the lungs and builds it up. And so at different levels of buildup, different levels of acuity, different therapies are needed. And so the NHS created a very strong protocol of using both CPAP with some supplemental oxygen from the wall as well as bilevel therapy and then upgrading to more aggressive noninvasive ventilation therapy because bilevel is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation therapy. But then upgrading to higher levels of noninvasive ventilation therapy and even upgrading all the way to the full intubation through the trachea of invasive mechanical ventilation. And all those different modes can be moved up and down by the doctor as they move through the process.  Your question about -- and it was a big question and concern early on that, oh, gosh, what if we have some contagion that some of the COVID-19 will come out? Well, before you put on an invasive mechanical ventilator, if a patient coughs or sneezes, the room is already contaminated. So even with invasive inhalation, there are some contamination protocols. And so what you need is a COVID-19 ward, you need PPE for everybody and you need to establish this floor of the hospital is for COVID-19 with negative pressure and take care of it that way. And that's what they've done in the U.K.. And actually, that moved to different parts of New York, New Jersey. And as we see this go around the world, people are learning to do that. What you have is a non-vented mask, so a ventilation mask with an inlet and outlet and then a filter on the outlet of the device. And so our Chief Medical Officer, Carlos -- Dr. Carlos Nunez, has been working with key opinion leaders worldwide, and we have a clinical white paper with best practice from Wuhan, from Milan, from London, from Munich, but they're doing it really well in Germany and from New York and around the world. And that protocol does include CPAP, it does include bilevel, it does include noninvasive ventilation with positive pressure, all with specific masks and specific circuit set up all the way up to invasive mechanical ventilation.  Now the second part of your question, after the crisis will people continue to use more noninvasive ventilation? I think the answer is yes. I think it's going to be similar to digital health, where we've had to use home sleep apnea testing, you've had to use remote patient monitoring during this crisis. And you don't want to go to a patient's home. You don't want them to have to come to a hospital. And so that's driven digital health. I think people, doctors in critical care units have seen how noninvasive ventilation, including bilevel has very well treated patients with COVID-19, why can't it very well treat COPD patients? Well, guess what? It can. So I think the adoption of NIV will increase post COVID-19 because of the learnings during COVID-19. I can't quantify that exactly. It's more a medium, long-term thing. But anyway, I hope that answers your question, David. It's a very good one. It deserves a longer answer. And I know we're 10 minutes over, we might just take two more questions and let everyone get back to their work day, 3 more questions. Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.
Matthew Mishan: And also it's really remarkable, the efforts of you and the employees of your company to support this crisis. So thank you for that as well. I'll just leave it to 1 because most of my questions have been asked. I've heard that there's potentially long-term respiratory implications from COVID-19 exposure. How do you see that patient transition to post-acute?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a great question, Matthew. I'll hand that to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rob, to talk about post COVID-19 discharge. What are the next steps, Rob?
Robert Douglas: Yes. Thanks, Matthew. That's a good question. It's still an uncertain world in terms of what these post protocols are going to be across the board. We're seeing different trials and tests being carried out. In some areas, we are seeing patients get discharged with oxygen, and we are noticing an uptick in demand for oxygen around the place. And in other areas, we are seeing some discharges with more CPAP. But I think it's still way too early to say, probably the earliest data we've got is in China where things are normalizing a little bit. The sleep labs aren't yet open, but we're seeing continued ongoing demand for longer-term ventilation. So it's probably leading off the dynamic, that Mick mentioned earlier, that ventilation is noninvasive ventilation and chronic ventilation is recognized as a more relevant treatment than what it had been before.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley.
Sean Laaman: Well done, Mick, clearly doing a great job navigating. Sorry if I've missed it, but my question is, the $35 million of COVID revenue, was there any geographic sort of breakup of that? And just to clarify, what's that all vent revenue?
Michael Farrell: Sean, that's a great question. Not comfortable going into details of where the $35 million came from. That's sort of our global number. And it's truly an estimate. It's -- the vast majority of it is ventilation. And so it's Astrals, Stellars, Lumis, AirCurve ST types of products. I'll hand over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to see if he wants to provide any further detail on that $35 million.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. I mean the only -- there is some -- there will be some mask and accessories things in that as well. You'd estimate making -- maybe that accounts for kind of 10% of that number and the rest would be devices.
Operator: Your last question comes from Gretel Janu with Crédit Suisse.
Gretel Janu: So you mentioned the double-digit declines in the diagnosis rates in the quarter due to lockdowns. I'm just wondering whether you saw any slowdown in the actual fleet new patient setups in the third quarter? Or will most of that impact from the slower sleep diagnosis impact the fourth quarter?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Gretel, thanks a lot. Look, as you can understand, there's a lot of moving pieces going on right at the moment, and we're watching it through the quarter. And in different countries, and even in some countries in the world, we've seen that decline. Like in China, we saw that decline in January, February, and we're actually starting to pick up on the rates as we started to exit the quarter, and some regions of China starting to open up and then diagnosis is starting to open up again. But -- and similarly in South Korea and some other areas that have COVID-19 under control now. But I'll hand over to Jim Hollingshead to see if he wants to provide any further details the sort of kinetics of the double-digit reduction in diagnostics and any impact on sort of that headwind, I guess, of sleep device sales, while we have the neutral element of sleep masks continuing through. Jim?
James Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Gretel. With a little bit of a lag, you can also see bit of a drop-off in new patient starts, which we have the ability through our connected solutions to see -- as I said before, I think we're seeing diagnosis stabilize a bit, and I expect some countries to start to turn back on in the near term. And we're seeing new patient starts also stabilize a bit. So hopefully, we'll -- hopefully, we get a bounce off of the floor here. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. It will be different country-by-country and even metro area by metro area.
Michael Farrell: Great. Well, thanks for all the questions, and thanks to everyone for continuing the 15 minutes over here. I think we'll all agree this was a very unique quarter for not just ResMed, but for all companies worldwide. Look, I'll go with the close now, I think, here and close on up. I'd like to thank again to all our shareholders who've joined us for this call. I'd also like to shout out again to the 7,500 Resmedians helping people in 140 countries. You guys are also shareholders in the most part, and I want to thank you for your dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital. Thanks for all that you do all day, every day. Thanks, especially to those frontline heroes, the people making the products, distributing the products and getting those vents to those 140 countries to somebody who's suffocating and needs our help. I look forward to talking to all of our stakeholders again here in 90 days. And with that, we'll close it up. Thank you, Diego.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Mick. Thank you all again for joining us today. And just a reminder, if you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or to Investor Relations. And as previously mentioned, all the documents, along with the transcript and a replay will be available on our website later today. Thanks, Diego. You can now close the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed's third quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-01-30 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Fiscal Year 2020 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great, thank you, Christine. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Great, thanks Amy, and I'll go a little fast on my prepared remarks so we still have time for Q&A, despite the phone difficulties. Thanks, Amy. And thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financials in further detail. Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category, particularly in the US market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. As the world's leading software driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market, and Air Solutions our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 90 million more people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. AirView, myAir, Propeller, and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers, and complete healthcare systems. We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. We will grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our healthcare products and solutions as we ended 2019 to our ambitious forward looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025. We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers, and healthcare systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money, and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. We're up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic US, as well as our global product sales, as well as from our software-as-a-service business. We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21. I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the device’s category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies as well as by improving Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category. We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea. Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid-teens. Our flagship masks the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continued their growth across global markets. The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We have launched a steady rhythm of mass innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i, and the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments.  With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each person's needs. Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement without therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems. Our Digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud based software combined with world leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have commenced pilots in a handful of US cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business over the longer term and on a deeper level. This partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions. Technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in the medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. We believe that technology combined with world leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. We will be there with Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. We will be there with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. We will also be there with Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy. We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patient, helping their caregivers and loved ones, as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems. The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. In December Propeller was included the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was access directly from the Propeller app via my pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020. Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SAAS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. Our SAAS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we left during November. We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits, excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SAAS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree tree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Difficulty] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. We just passed the one year anniversary without MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. We're doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio. And we have all the elements in place to do that. It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well. We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed and customers as well as their patients and residents. I would like to take a moment to announce and exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in the process of completing. Just this week Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and logical services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation. For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021. In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improved software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and increased efficiency resulting in better system outcomes as well as a high quality of life for the person in out of hospital care. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. We are focused on our triple aim; first, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and third, to improve quality of life to the ultimate customer, the patient. With that all hands go over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was 736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were 408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled 242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; US, Canada and Latin America device sales were 204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales was 204 million, an increase of 19% of the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales of 162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was 79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 11%. Globally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was 87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustments to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition related expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sale, rather than being allocated to operating expenses. We've made this change along with SEC disclosure guidance. This mainly [ph] will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP profit ratios going forward. We have included reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press release. Going forward I will reference this non-GAAP metric because I believe it is the best measure of our underline gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter last year. Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points, this was predominantly attributable to viable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were 171 million, an increase a 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were 50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% contains a 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Total amortization of acquired intangibles was 20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 14.1 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 219.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the quarter with 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share based compensation in particular the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance documents in November, Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective the tax rate would have been 21.6%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will bring the range of 19% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10. Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the text benefit that I've just discussed. Excluding the impact of this guidance our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by the timing of tax payments with 111 million in tax paid in our second quarter. Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the US Department of Justice of 40.6 million this quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 45.5 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of 56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of 6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with a Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately 6 million in equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had 1.3 billion in gross debt and 1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were 4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross Margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SAAS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great, thank you Brett. We'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Christine. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, guys and Good morning to Brett out in Australia.
Mick Farrell: Thank you.
Margaret Kaczor: And you may be the first one for me is on mask growth. Obviously, you guys continue to do very, very well from that perspective. So as we look at the last maybe 12 to 18 months, can you give us a sense of the relative impact of new product launches, especially in the white spaces maybe that you weren't in before, the resupply agreements that you kind of referenced, a little bit at JP Morgan, market growth and general share taking and the idea is as we look forward how're the moving dynamics between those categories, and how do you kind of adjust your strategy to keep performance high? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis, and even taking out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them. There's an increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions when we're achieving 87% adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patient is using myAir, and all the digital techs in play that drives up our mask growth. Secondly, when there's resupply and patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used, and we are partnering with Brightree, Connect, and with ResMed ReSupply to provide that and the acquisition of SnapWorx will help. And then thirdly and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of four really exciting new mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call the minimalist category and the freedom category where people move through different positions during sleep; prone, left, right, sleepers want a Freedom mask and people who had some claustrophobia or want small, larger masks go to the minimalist category, and the F30 that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all the above contributing to this really strong growth. We still think that the market growth right is in the high-single digits for masks. And we took really good share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things: resupply, adherence, mask innovation and we plan to do just that.
Margaret Kaczor: Thanks guys.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Margaret.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matthew Mishan: Great and thank you for taking the questions, hi, just a follow up on the market share gains in masks. Are you winning new patients at a higher market share clip or are you able to convert existing sleep apnea patients from competitors and getting them to switch?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep Division to walk through that.
Jim Hollingshead: Good morning, Matthew. I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well.
Matthew Mishan: I can hear you just fine.
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with mask that we’ve had so many masks launched, and and as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15 months. All of them have been successful launches. We now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest portfolio offering of mask on the market. So, we continue to take new patient share across all three mask categories. I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching, and there's less market data available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully.
Matthew Mishan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman: Good morning, Mick. Hope you're well. My question relates to something you announced last quarter, and I wonder if you can give a bit of an update on how this Novartis deal with Propeller, is there any update there and how that might be tracking? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled pharmaceutical medicines. Look, the beauty of it – as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And so, Stage 1 and 2, with Propeller, we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicines that their doctor prescribed for them but also engage with that person because they're going to – it's a progressive disease, they're going to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD. And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease progression and it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that therapy is the pharmaceutical inhaler or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrated or that therapy as they move forward is a non-invasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these partnerships. As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma side and as we hit milestones on the healthcare system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we're still enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we will give updates on the clinical data, but also importantly commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020. Thanks for your question, Sean.
Sean Laaman: Yeah, thank you Mick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is open.
John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. My question just relates to the increase in the SG&A, obviously, you've got fantastic leverage from that and I think we've talked about it previously, but the 2% underlying seems a – I think that's a record low numbers for you. And just give us a sense perhaps, of how that might look over the next six months and maybe going forward or should it return back to the kind of mid-single digit levels?
Mick Farrell: So I'll hand that to Brett who's down in Sydney.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, thanks. Hi, John. Yeah, it was a low this quarter. And we did benefit, certainly from much lower litigation related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate. In my guidance, I said, I think will revert back to the range of 23 to 25 for the second half, which would suggest that it will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year was probably the single biggest driver. And that certainly motivated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range above given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think.
John Deakin-Bell: That's helpful. Thanks Brett.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin from UBS. Your line is open.
Mick Farrell: Saul, you may be on mute.
Saul Hadassin: No, I'm not. Can you hear me?
Mick Farrell: We can hear you now. Yes.
Saul Hadassin: Great, thanks. Yeah, just a question for Brett, Brett just on gross margin, I'm just wondering if you can give some color on the underlying sleep and respiratory care business to what the gross margin has done ex acquisition contribution and usually provide an outlook for the rest of the fiscal year for gross margin as well. Can you just give us that some color there too? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I mean, I think going forward the second half, I think we'll be consistent with where we are, would be an estimate on the gross margin, as you know, a lot of moving parts on that. That would be our expectation. If you look at the acquisitions, we did – [indiscernible] halfway through the quarter, but fairly – it's kind of fairly minimal impact this quarter, the big drivers of that year-on-year growth or expansion of that gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out performance you're seeing in mask growth and that's typically high margins, what you would see on devices so that that's the biggest impact. And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they continue to come through on gross margin, so they're the two big drivers this quarter.
Saul Hadassin: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Shane Storey from Wilson HTM Limited. Your line is open.
Shane Storey: Yeah, hi, thanks. Just looking again, back at the US mask business kind of just from another angle, you spoke about the adherence in resupply. But have you measured the step up in the number of mask per patient per year say, over the last 12 to 18 months and the last reference point that I've got is may be a tick under two per patient per year? So any observations around that might be very useful. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Shane thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a government mandated requirement that you provide to masks, two masks per patient per year. And it's different in all the 140 countries. Yeah, you focused on the US growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we didn't talk about that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look out of the 5000 customers in the US there's a broad spectrum of adoption of Brightree. Resupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed resupply, and technologies like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range. But Jim, do you want to – Jim Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask supply metrics?
Jim Hollingshead: Yes. Thanks Mick and thanks Shane. I would just add to add to a mix that just a couple things. The first one is the trend is we don't we don't talk about the number of publicly obviously, but the trend in the US has been steadily slowly, but steadily up over the last several years. And we attribute that both to the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call. So better adherence tools that we're providing our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence initially and therefore better long term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial parallel levels and so it's a good trend and there's still a lot of opportunity.
Shane Storey: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Hey, good afternoon guys. My question is just on specs [ph] businesses and growth rate there. I was wondering if you could help us reconstruct that growth rate, particularly between MatrixCare and Brightree and perhaps as part of that, to give us an update as to your understanding of how those businesses are performing since you've been acquired. I guess, with reference to the EPS outlook that you provided at the time of the acquisitions.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SAAS and again SAAS this quarter was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out and you'll see that in our financials. It's a very hyper competitive sector, when you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility software and you look at home health and hospice software, so I'm going to be really hesitant to give detailed market share and/or growth rates within each of those sectors. What I said on the prepared remarks is true that cost – if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice, as well as the others private duty home care and client communities. The weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digit. And during the December quarter over that portfolio we held share, we grew at the – taking out the acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth. We grew in that high single digit on our weighted average portfolio. One thing I'll say is we've – when we hit April here in 2020, we will have and Brightree four years. And as you guys remember, because you followed the stock for a long time, the first two years with Brightree we were investing. Yeah, we put some new management team leaders in there we brought in new CEO, new CTO and some skill sets in R&D. We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in detail, but qualitatively I'll say that the investments that we put in those first two years into Brightree are really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share, the growth is picking up. And at MatrixCare we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management skills and capabilities and looking obviously back in synergies across our portfolio. So I think we can meet or beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting out of that in our MatrixCare investment.
Steve Wheen: Thanks Mick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much. Just a quick one from me, you mentioned that the mask sales included some software revenues, just wondering if you could explain what that is and how much contribution that will make going forward?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that.
Brett Sandercock: Sure. The probably the bigger one there is the – just through the software related to the – or the platform related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of – that's probably the biggest single delta, but there are a few other things there, but that's probably the biggest one.
David Low: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much, just obviously looking at the current of coronavirus issue and I think if we go back to size, you might sales of about $5 million of sleep [indiscernible] levels into China. Just wondering if there's any follow through affect to yourself from the current coronavirus.
Rob Douglas: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. There's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment in China. And so tracking, it's difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we think obviously the hospital's going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to size or not, we don't know yet. We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team in China building good ventilators in China for China. And so, in fact, some of that team has been working in some of these hospitals and Jason Sun, Head of China they're local heroes who are really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale, there will be an offset as well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there may be some in asleep in China, but it's unlikely all of that to be material. Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times our supply chain isn't configured around China. Most of its not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in their way work closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but we'll have to keep a close eye on them.
Andrew Goodsall: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just to continue the discussion on the SaaS business and probably most specifically previously we talked about resupply expansion and that given over about six months in, can you share how the resupply program outside of sleep apnea is tracking and what your expectations are for the remainder of financial year '20?
Mick Farrell: Thanks Lyanne. Yeah, so you're talking about our expansion of – our resupply capabilities, we went into some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products and so those – they're not a material part of ResMed's overall business. But they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look off to the HME sector beyond just sleep apnea and sleep app supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work through and so it's not material to our overall business. I'm not going to break out the specifics and other than to say they're going well and customers are adopting them and I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to break out like that. But it's early days and it's a good strategic ply of Brightree to sort of expand their capability with workflow optimization and both the combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and sleep apnea supplies. It's the same technology used on those diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there and requiring for authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. So would you be able to give us an update on the outlook for competitive bidding? So what are your expectations in terms of reimbursement changes in 2021? And if there is potentially a decline in mask reimbursements, how is ResMed thinking about responding? Thanks
Mick Farrell: So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave?
David Pendarvis: Yeah. Thanks Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were last quarter. And that is we're waiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We expect them at the end of the North American summer. So sometime around August or September and we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry made to educate bidders, so they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that that we conduct business with our customers now on a portfolio basis. And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space. We expect to there'll continue to be strong demand for mask resupply that will continue to be important part of our customers business and it'll be an important part for patients' long term adherence success. So we don't see any significant changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be.
Gretel Janu: Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.
David Bailey: Yeah, good morning, guys. Just for me Brett, cash flow looked a bit awake this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk through some of the moving parts there? You've called out the Department of Justice litigation settlement. Just talk us through what normalized tax cash payment would look like? And then also net interest on a cash basis for the quarter will be great.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, so yeah, was impacted by plenty of tax payments as well, if you look at it underlying, excluding those I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalize is probably –you're probably more like around the kind of 40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be more like that. So that's impacted for this quarter. Expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of cash flow performance. And in the next one was that on the interest, interest expense?
David Bailey: Managed expenses, it is broadly monitor [ph] the income statement you're talking about.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, pretty close. You wouldn't – that's a good proxy. It's not that far different to that.
David Bailey: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chris Cooper: Thanks for taking the question. I was going to follow up to one of the previous questions. So the competitive bidding, I know it's a bit early to speculate on the particular outcome. I just guess I'm more interested in how you expect to manage the discussion with the DNA partners yourselves. Would you expect positive and negative changes to be passed on to you one to one? Or is there an outcome here where, I guess you bet more downside than the upside given there's a possible agreement here were some categories going to increase and some decrease just any thoughts around how you think that would be helpful.
Mick Farrell: So I'll hand that for David and if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer perspective, as well, but Dave you first and then Jim?
David Pendarvis: Sure, I mean, we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners with us and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can and we want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them and the environment for the last year and a half and for the balance of calendar year '20 is that there's been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time. But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding, obviously, they made their own decisions, we're confident that the bidding process will be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it'll end up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that.
Jim Hollingshead: Thank you, Dave. I'll just add to that, I mean, I think that's very well, but we do have very good relationships with all of our customers with our key customers and we'll work through it together. The other thing I would just remind everybody is a Medicare fee for service is the minority part of the market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Mike Matson from Needham. Your line is open.
Mike Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just have, I guess one more competitive bidding question. So with – specifically with non-invasive ventilation, that's the first time it's been included, I think could see a fairly steep decline. So can you maybe comment on what you expect there? And then also, I don't know if you could quantify how much of your sales are coming from non-invasive ventilation in the US, but just to help us understand what the exposure is.
Mick Farrell: Dave and Jim, you again,
David Pendarvis: Up again, so thanks, Mike. Non-invasive ventilation obviously is in two different categories. One what we would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that it's now going to be a competitive bidding, our air curve ranges the buy levels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not changing. It's more on the life support side. And that is newly there, but they're also had been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you saw in the round two kind of range previously for the sleep products. Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit particularly COPD patients can benefit from these devices, they ought to get into the hands and that's of those patients and it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the in the home are making sure the device is working appropriately, so you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of customers who actually do this kind of business, and they're probably likely to be focused on what their real cost of serving are. So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers, they'll bid appropriately, so that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service that's really, particularly in this area very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes. But we don't break out specifically our sales of life support anywhere in the US or otherwise, but thanks.
Mike Matson: Okay, thanks and then just would SnapWorx, maybe just comment on what that brings to the table they didn't already have with Brightree? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, so SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree end-to-end capabilities that SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They have provided to a number of customers and ability to further reach out to customers. And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology talking and the Brightree team looked at the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs that created it. And we're really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which has better adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly, with the end user customer. And what I bring it back which is the patient, what I bring it back to this is some data, some clinical data that we presented from the 5.5 billion knots of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as you engage with the patient and resupply the two add to each other. And some data we just released last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep, we reduce the total healthcare costs for inpatient by 8%. So this is all tied together, right. So Brightree, resupply – ResMed resupply and SnapWorx will increase adherence, drive increased mask resupply and that will also through that increased adherence lower the costs of the total healthcare system by 8% for every hour of sleep after those seven hours and so I think that combination is really powerful of now Brightree plus SnapWorx. Now, it's early days, we're just literally going through the finals of this acquisition, but watch us over the next 12, 24 months and we'll give you updates obviously every quarter as to how well that integration on that technology's going.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. This is Mike on for Suraj. We read recently that Fitbit is adding an oxygen variation graph for select users with an FDA submission for sleep apnea diagnosis somewhere in the near term here. I'm just curious if you see that as longer term helping to increase the number of OSA patients treated.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Mike thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting involved in the field of, I call it health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we have our partnership with Verily and I have the Google watch as part of their baseline study and they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call the diagnosis; I call it identification of potentially at risk people for poor sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what they try to do, and that Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio. I believe there's an acquisition in line there. It'll probably add on to that capability of, if you see de-saturations in the oxygen, there's a higher likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those de-sat, but there's a high likelihood of sleep apnea, so I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them they need to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification, engagement enrollment capability we're trying to perform. But look, Jim you run the global fleet business, is there any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to identify more patients?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure yet, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good that companies like Fitbit are putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might have a sleep disorder. And we know that there's 936 million people globally, who suffer from sleep apnea, the vast majority of them don't know it. And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand easier and so when companies like Fitbit – there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they when they decide to put that out in consumers hands. It's fantastic for us and for those patients more importantly.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks Mick and Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: So maybe just two quick ones, one just on local manufacturing just given bushfires, obviously in Australia, so any update just on that manufacturing plant. And then just one on legislation in the US, H.R.2771 just to maintain the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas, is there any update on actually where that sits and the likelihood that it gets to Congress this year? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions Anthony. I'll ask Rob to answer the first one around manufacturing and then Dave to answer the second one around the H.R.
Rob Douglas: Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. As we said the ResMed supply chain is configured around multiple sources. At this stage most of our manufactured products come from our Singapore plant, but we have full capability in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products. But we have full process capability in both plants. The fire season in Australia has been devastating. However, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of Sydney, which would actually make the whole thing a lot worse if it did. And today, we haven't seen any interference with that at all. But if there was interference that wouldn't overly affect us because of our ability to reconfigure.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
David Pendarvis: And as to the bill and we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas. It's difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771. I think it's – you may have noticed there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year, when I think some of the Medicare extenders come up for renewal, that there could be a push to get this along with some of the other items the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see. But we certainly support that. And at a minimum, Congress indicating their support the industry is positive.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.
David Bailey: You know like I'm just following up on Saul's question actually, just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution of those acquisitions to US or America's masks and accessories revenues for the quarter that would be helpful.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, I said in the prepared – thanks for the question David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the – so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16%, and you take out Propeller software, you're going to be in the mid-teens, so maybe 100 basis points or something on global. And if you take the US growth, we're all pretty – I mean most of the Propeller software is the US growth on masks was 19% on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points there, you're probably around 17% growth in the US territory, so 16 becomes around 15 and 19 would become around 17 David. I think that answers both your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra eight minutes since we were eight minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Hey, great. Thanks, Christine. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people sleep better, you help people breathe better, you help people live better lives outside the hospital in a 140 countries, which is pretty amazing. Thanks for all that you do today and every day and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy?
Amy Wakeham: Great, thank you all again, for joining us today and to echo Mick, thanks for bearing with us through the audio difficulties. If you do have any questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and hopefully a clean replay of today's call will be available on our website. Christine, you can now close the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's second quarter of fiscal year 2020 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-10-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2020 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results for ResMed’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail. We have started fiscal year 2020 right where we left off with 2019. Our team achieved another quarter of balanced growth across the portfolio, driven by continued strong performance in the mask category. We are taking share with recent new product introductions and our solutions are enabling increased therapy adherence as well as expansion of resupply programs to those who need it. Our dedicated team of more than 7,500 ResMedians around the world, have again delivered strong results. As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we continue to use technology to advance our leadership position. We have sold more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And our AirView, cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 11 million patient accounts. In the last 12 months, we changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a complete mask system, to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare branded out of hospital software systems are helping to manage 93 million more people. So during the last 12 months we improved more than 108 million lives with ResMed products, services and software solutions. We are well on our way to the ambitious goal to improve 250 million lives in 2025. Our connected solutions are providing us with valuable access to de-identified therapy data that we are using to derive actionable insights to benefit patients, physicians and providers, as well as to inform future innovation in products and software. These datasets are growing exponentially and we now have 5 billion knots of medical sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. We remained laser focused on growth in our core market of sleep apnea, as well as in our adjacent respiratory medical markets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as asthma. Our expanded focus to now grow outside the hospital software solutions allows us to help customers create efficiencies to take costs out of the healthcare system and to improve the quality of care across home medical equipment, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and beyond. We believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today. That's where we are winning today and that's where we will continue to win in the future as we provide market-leading value to customers. Let's now briefly review our top level financial results for the quarter. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 17% in constant currency across the portfolio. This growth was well balanced across domestic U.S. and global products sales, as well as balanced across our Software-as-a-Service businesses. We continued to deliver operating leverage in the quarter leading to a non-GAAP operating profit growth of 22% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93. Turning to a brief discussion of our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter. We achieved year-over-year constant currency device growth of 6% globally, supported by very strong 8% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies. We achieved 4% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and rest of world. We achieved excellent device growth in the UK, Switzerland and across our Nordics countries. As discussed over the last few quarters, we experienced a continued headwind during the quarter for device growth in France as a result of digital health-related fleet upgrades. We expect that headwind to ease by the end of this fiscal year and then return to market device growth in France. It is great to see a steady flow of our digital health solutions into different European countries and to see positive constant currency device growth across the continent this quarter. The growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 19% in constant currency globally. This is well ahead of market growth rates, indicating we gained significant market share during the quarter. The reason that we continued to take share around the world is that we make the smallest, the quietest and the most comfortable masks available in the market. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. The success of these flagship masks was augmented during the quarter by good uptake of our recent mask launches. To recap those launches, we have now launched four new masks during the last 12 months; the F30, the N30i and the P30i. And just this week, actually on Monday, our newest innovation was launched, the N30. We have the right mask for every patient, every time, and the N30 adds innovative dimensions to these portfolios. The N30 is a world first tube-down nasal cradle CPAP mask in a new product subcategory that we are calling the minimalist category. The N30 is our smallest, our lightest mask ever and our quietest nasal mask ever. I personally think this new N30 is another winner from our amazing research and development engineers. Watch this space as it gets into the hands of our market-leading marketing and sales teams. Now mask portfolio overall is positioned to offer world-leading options for physicians to prescribe for home care providers to fit in a first-time set-up, and most especially for the needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet all underserved customer needs. The bottom line is that our new masks have a lot of runway ahead. Unfortunately, they don't let me talk about ResMed’s future product pipeline, so I won’t. Our success comes as healthcare providers, physicians and patients around the world continue to vote with their wallets and choose ResMed products, not just for the innovative design and high quality of our devices and masks, but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions that we offer. Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and apps like Propeller, are all leading to significant improvements in lowering cost, and improving health outcomes and improving quality of life for patients around the world. Through digital health technology, we are driving patient engagement so that people can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, healthcare providers, payers and governments. There's still a long way to go. Our research that was just published by the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal in July shows that there are over 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, while only around 20 million or so are being treated today. We keep forging ahead, investing in our own research and development to drive further innovation and advancement, as well as by working with partners. On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is working on software solutions to help identify and engage and better manage more people with sleep apnea. It is very early days on – in this JV, but our philosophy is that the more person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal healthcare outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. Over time, we know this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader chronic disease management ecosystem, covering not just sleep apnea, but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and beyond. These chronic disease management platforms will include clinical care as well as wellness improvements in nutrition, in cardiovascular exercise and in mental health. Let's now turn to our second vector of growth here at ResMed, our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. We don't believe they are well served by healthcare systems today. We see the opportunity to better manage COPD through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions that can help patients as they progress with this chronic disease, including how patients are communicated to, how patients are encouraged in their medical care and how patients are looked after as individual persons. We're advancing our respiratory care strategy in multiple ways. Earlier this summer we introduced a number of enhancements to AirView, our cloud-based patient management platform. We are making management of ventilation patients much simpler and much more useful for home medical equipment providers. Physicians and HMEs can now look deep into therapy data to see key performance indicators such as pulse rate, inspiratory time, maximum airflow, and even a patient’s rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI. All these data are now available within our digital healthcare ecosystem, with the easy to use AirView platform. Our goal is to help create a frictionless experience when managing COPD patients with ResMed's solutions. Our team at Propeller also continues to grow their business as we move from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with leading respiratory pharmaceutical companies. The team was recently at the European Respiratory Society Annual Congress in Madrid. It was great to see Propeller represented at multiple pharma booths, including live demonstrations of Propeller solutions for physicians. Propeller was also featured in several scientific presentations during ERS, including the public announcement of a new large COPD outcomes trial that's sponsored by Novartis. The trial will compare Propeller plus COPD standard of care to COPD standard of care alone. The trial has already begun enrolling patients during this quarter. As we outlined, when we acquired Propeller in January, the digital health opportunity with respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build into critical mass. This quarter, we passed a significant milestone with more than 100,000 people enrolled into the Propeller ecosystem. Let's be clear, we are still in the early days of market development here. The analogy is that we are now just lacing our shoes for the digital health ultra marathon in both COPD and in asthma. So there's lots of terrain ahead. The evolution that we have made in our respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD. From Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD with Propeller's pharmaceutical adherence solutions to Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD with portable oxygen concentrators as well as our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilation solutions. Let's now turn to our third vector of growth, our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. Our competitive advantage derives from our leadership position in SaaS solutions for home medical equipment, for skilled nursing facilities, for home, health, hospice, life plan communities and home care services. ResMed is the best strategic player competing in these verticals. And we have the expertise running global digital health systems at scale to be able to succeed in the future. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory this quarter with revenue up 83% year-on-year during the quarter. Clearly, growth in this first quarter was accelerated leveraging our MatrixCare acquisition in November of 2018. We will lap that acquisition during this current second quarter. We estimate that the underlying market growth of the blended portfolio of seven out-of-hospital SaaS verticals that we serve is in the high single digits. Leaving out the MatrixCare acquisition, we grew right in line with the market in Q1. We have set up an execution plan to continue to innovate and to continue to launch market-leading upgrades combined with new capabilities that will allow us to gain market share in our SaaS verticals and participate in the fastest growing ones so that we can beat market growth. We plan to exit fiscal 2020 with solid double digit growth in our SaaS business segment. One example of the progress that we're making in our SaaS portfolio is the recent announcement of our collaboration with Cerner as a new preferred provider for home health and hospice software. This agreement validates ResMed as an industry-leading provider of digital health solutions for out-of-hospital healthcare. Our Matrixcare managed offering for home health and hospice customers includes the best-of-breed capabilities from both the MatrixCare technology and from the Brightree technology. This agreement ensures our home health and hospice solution is available to all of Cerner's large customer base. The net result is growth opportunities for both Cerner and MatrixCare sales teams. In fact at the recent Cerner Health Care Conference, a major healthcare system with a very large home health business was introduced to the ResMed solution and they are quickly moving toward a contract with our MatrixCare team. It is clearly early days as the ink dries on the Cerner contract, but the bottom line is, we are excited to drive growth from this partnership and to leverage interoperability to provide value for all of our customers. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. We are helping people stay out of the hospital and in the care setting of their choice with lower costs and a higher quality of life for the person. The best place that people often choose is almost always their own home. Ageing in place is a trend that is growing not just in the U.S. but globally and we plan to enable and leverage that positive change. We think that's an important part of the future of healthcare. Before I turn the call over to Brett, Let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow throughout fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving both top-line and bottom-line growth as well as executing on our strategy to improve 250 million lives in healthcare that's delivered outside the hospital in 2025. We are focused on our triple aim to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the person who simply to sleep well, to breathe well and to live a better life well away from that hospital. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you in Sydney.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $691 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $317 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $224 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $193 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $152 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, a 4% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $72 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 19% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 19% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $87 million, an increase of 83% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 59.5% compared to 58.3% in the same quarter last year and 59.3% in Q4 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points. This was predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, the MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $167 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 16%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.6% compared to 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2020. R&D expenses for the quarter were $48 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 27%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $18.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.3 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $191 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $135 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.83. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $162 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $38 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million. We recorded equity losses of $6.8 million in our income statement in the September quarter as I said via Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity loss of each quarter in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $49 million of our outstanding debt. At September 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. Finally, to recap, our top-line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q1 non-GAAP operating profit up 22% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks. Brett. We will now going to turn the call over to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please do feel free to return to the call queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. So just on the U.S. device growth continues to be very strong, just wondering what would be the growth in kind of new patient setups in the quarter, give us some detail on that?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel. So we don't actually have full visibility even to the number. We sell to in the U.S. to home medical equipment companies that then sell to patients that are renewing in their five-year renewal or to new patient. So we don't have full visibility into that. But it is interesting with a reasonably sized patient pool in the United States it would be a good double-digit percentage or so of those that will be replenishment devices. But the 8% growth I think is really ahead of market. We think the market growth is in the sort of mid-single digits. And so to be at 8% growth in the U.S. shows that we were taking some share due to the value of Air Solutions, AirView and myAir and all the sort of digital health solutions that are there.
Gretel Janu: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Gretel.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Yes. Hi guys. Just a question also on the devices, there seems to be certainly amongst the DME land a bit of a rush on COPD codes and the setting up of patients with ventilators. Just wondering if you're seeing any benefit from that, particularly around amongst your Astral – your ventilator range in particular, the Astral?
Mick Farrell: Steve, thanks for the question. We actually saw really solid growth in the core fleet business, as a sizeable chunk of that 8% growth in the U.S. Astral tends to be more of a player, ventilation in general tends to be more of a player in Europe and so some of that sort of 4% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and rest of world will have been driven by the Astral in some sort of much smaller element of the 8% U.S. growth. But one thing that we've been really strong with our DME customers is to make sure that the right device goes on the right patient at the right time. And when you look at COPD, there were lots of solutions from our [indiscernible] as well as – so non-invasive ventilation, as well as even Stellar product in non-invasive ventilation all the way through to our Astral product, which is really a life support ventilator and should be used in very severe COPD and in life support needs. And so, yes, it really wasn't a huge contributor in the U.S. this quarter, probably slightly more significant in Europe. But it's really good solid balanced growth, if you like, from our sleep apnea side with some additions from respiratory care is how I'd position it.
Steve Wheen: Great. Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon. And good afternoon to most people, good morning for others. But thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture, I know some people are going to focus on the device sleep apnea growth, but I know you guys ended up delivering 11% top line growth, excluding acquisitions and that's above market in almost every category and even as you're seeing a headwind in France. So I guess looking out whether it's this year or the next couple of years, what prohibits you guys from continuing that double-digit top line growth rate and what could drive it higher or lower from today's levels? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. Certainly, we did have a very good quarter here in Q1. And as you said, we grew like sort of 11% constant currency globally in our sleep and respiratory care combined businesses. If you think about the global growth and we have enough data now to know that the growth really is in that mid- to high-single digits, so the devices growing in the mid-single digits and masks growing in the high-single digits. Clearly, we did take share in Q1 and a lot of that is driven by the digital health technology on the flow generator side to have some of the share taking on the device side, and then the new product introductions that I detailed in the prepared remarks, four new masks in addition to two strong flagship marks there, so NPI has been an incredible contributor to us. Just if you think through the year ahead, even during this quarter that we're currently in the second quarter, we're going to lap one of those four product launches on the mask side and we'll continue to lap those during the quarter. So look, I'm always very excited about our innovations; the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and I think that innovation drives. But you can't outgrow market forever, right? You've got to then focus on getting more patients into the funnel, which is our whole identify, engage and enroll people in. So I think a fantastic Q1, but as we look through the fiscal year, we think we can meet or beat market growth, but you're not going to beat it every single time.
Margaret Kaczor: Great. Thank you, guys.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Your next question is from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much. During the period, we heard – we saw from your competitor Philips that they had issues with their connected care business. They talked about tariffs, et cetera. Just wondering sort of market landscape in the U.S., whether you saw any disruption from that? Do you think some of the – that ResMed may have been a beneficiary of the issues that they were working through?
Mick Farrell: Yes, I'll hand that – good questions, David. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO.
Rob Douglas: Sure, David. Just generally on the tariffs issue just to reiterate, as we've said before, the way our whole supply chain is configured, we're not really affected by the specific tariffs. We export very little into China from the U.S. and very little from China to the U.S. Our supply chain is more Southeast Asian focused. And we've got a great team in China doing local products for China. So that's pretty solid. Our AirView solutions on the other hand, mostly by the way developed by teams all around the world, but really a strong product offering, continues to deliver superior value to our customers. And we think – with day-in and day-out we'll fight competitions with those products and belief that we've got a better proposition to offer. So we – from our perspective, we didn't see any particular competitive issues that were sort of changing the normal competitive dynamics. We do have to sell and execute well. And our teams have been doing that.
David Low: Great. All right. Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much, guys. Perhaps just thinking forward into competitive bidding and I guess the bids are in, so I guess by the next time we’ve got a sense where the clearing price land. I'm just wondering whether there’s any preliminary comments you've got and your thoughts there or any preliminary actions you're taking I guess to prepare for competitive bidding, and whether that involves new product launches or anything? Just say preliminary is your sort of doing or preparatory actions?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll hand that to David Pendarvis.
David Pendarvis: Thanks, Andrew. The – obviously we spent a lot of time along with others in the industry trying to educate the market participants so they would be able to bid effectively and bid smartly given the new rules. We remained encouraged with the changes that were put in place principally that clearing price is what's going to drive reimbursement as opposed to the median price under the old regime, and some of the other changes that were made, including requiring bonds to bid in particular areas. We hoping that together with the education that the industry did will lead to smart bids and that'll lead to a fair, more realistic reimbursement. We obviously didn't participate in the bidding process and haven't had direct conversations with customers about what they bid. So it's all conjecture at this point as to where the ultimate reimbursement will land. But no matter where it is, whether it's a private pay, reimbursement change or a Medicare U.S. change or something elsewhere in the world, we're continually working with our customers to help them be more efficient, help them take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves and to enable them to better serve patients under whatever the reimbursement schemes are. So we'll definitely continue to do that, and watch where the U.S. Medicare landscape evolves. But at the moment, that's still a year and a bit away. So we'll just keep doing what we're doing and obviously focus on it when the time comes.
Andrew Goodsall: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Solid mask growth outside of outside of America, and I just wanted to understand you've had one of your competitors launch a new full face mask outside of America. Have you seen any difference in your full face mask sales outside of the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And how are you positioning yourself now that they've got FDA approval to launch within the U.S.?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. And look, we have multiple competitors in the 120 countries we sell into and we expect new product introduction from our competitors on a regular basis. Yes, as you noted, during the quarter, we had 19% constant currency growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. We also had 19% constant currency growth of masks in Europe, Asia and rest of world, where some of those masks and new launches have already been in play during the quarter. So I think we've – I know we've got the most robust sleep apnea mask portfolio on the planet versus our competitors in all the 120 countries that we participate in. But there's no arrogance or hubris heated out. Our team of R&D engineers furiously working, not only on technology to address underserved needs, but to think differently about how to really achieve that ultimate goal, which is sort of the silent CPAP and the invisible mask. And if you look at the N30 that we just launched, this minimalist category mask, it's about as close to an invisible mask as you can get. It is small, it is quiet, it is comfortable. So, look, I love innovation coming to the market from our competitors and from us because it keeps us all honest. But during the quarter, we performed very well versus all the NPI from our competitors with our own NPI. And I expect us to be able to do that into the future. And competition is just a healthy part of making sure that tens of millions of people get the breathing night.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citi. Your line is open.
John Deakin-Bell: Well, good morning. I have a question for Brett. Just to deconstruct that gross margin expansion a little bit. I think previously you've given us the fee of what was from the MatrixCare. But can you just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of strong mask growth, higher margin that would have impacted, and also whether there's a more benign processing environment in the U.S. which is helping as well?
Brett Sandercock: Hi, John, it’s Brett. I think it's all of those things, probably the pricing environment is relatively been on at the moment, so the impacts there were pretty modest. In terms of acquisitions that contributed around 50 basis points. So if you think about that, still really a strong, let's call it organic expansion of the margin, which is really good. That's really around the manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. And then clearly some product mix benefit there as you saw the outperformance in the mask growth. So a combination of all of those factors I think led to that expansion.
John Deakin-Bell: Okay. Thanks, Brett.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open.
David Bailey: Good morning, guys. Just in relation to U.S. mask and accessories, you've talked to adherence to resuppliers as key drivers of growth. Just wondering if you can comment on your views as to those factors being drivers of growth over the next two to three years?
Mick Farrell: Yes, it's a good question, David. I'll hand that to Rob.
Rob Douglas: Yes, thanks, David. Yes. The resupply program has definitely supported the mask portfolio. We've talked many times. You've got to understand the sort of the feedback of this. If we can get patients onto a good mask, they're more likely to stay on treatment, they'll do better and then they'll need a mask. And so we continue to see that dynamic happening. Our software solutions that support the resupply programs and enable our HME customers to manage resupply programs more efficiently and ensure that the patients have the treatment that they need when they need it. We’re also supporting it. These are long-term programs. We've been running resupply programs for many years now and our teams will continue to refine and focus it. And as Mick said earlier though, these markets are competitive. We do have competitors playing it. We have competition in resupply programs as well as in mask. And it really gets down to, we've got a really strong team executing broadly across all parts of the portfolio on this that will continue to make sure that we're providing the best solutions for patients and providers delivering the best outcomes. So I think it's really a steady as she goes progress. We love – we really like these resupply programs and they're providing us a very solid steady business.
David Bailey: Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, David.
Operator: Next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman: Good morning, everybody. Mick, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the Novartis study you mentioned in your preliminary comments and perhaps some timelines that would be really useful.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. I wasn't at ERS, but I'll hand over to David Pendarvis, who can give us some more detail on the Novartis clinical trial.
David Pendarvis: Terrific. Sean, we mentioned in the opening remarks, it goes by the name of magnify, and of course with trials these days you have to have a good acronym, and that stands for maximizing adherence and gaining new information for your COPD. And the trial is going to be obviously sponsored by Novartis. And what it's doing is taking patients within clinics and then within those clinics, randomizing the patients to either standard clinical practice or using Propeller. And then there'll be a comparison. And the endpoint is the time to failure of treatment. And then failure of treatment is defined in various ways such as needing an additional medication, having some particularly acute exacerbations, winding up in hospital, those kinds of things. And it'll look and see, whether or not adding the adherence benefits of Propeller linked since the time that patients stay in that good controlled state. It's beginning recruiting now and I believe it's supposed to run through the end of 2021. So it will take quite a while before it meets it’s – the end of that time period. But the important thing is a lot of the data that's been out now has been done in the asthma setting. Obviously, that's an important area and we want to take care of those patients. But the COPD strategy is very important to us because of the way it connects with our overall respiratory care strategy. So having someone like Novartis sponsor a study, looking at Propeller benefits to a COPD patient population, we think is a real important milestone and we'll look for good benefits to come out of that study in the future, but it will be a few years.
Sean Laaman: Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you. Great. I'm just going to have a follow-up to the Novartis question and somewhat Mick, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago indications of interest from AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Novartis on Propeller health. I'm just wondering if you have an update there and anything you can share potentially on how that would be priced on a per user per month basis. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes Thanks for the question, Anthony. Pharma companies – there are many respiratory pharmaceutical, pharma players in the field and the names you mentioned all have drugs in the market. One thing about pharma companies is they’re very competitive with each other and they don’t want information shared too much publicly. Certainly on our Investor deck we put the names of those where we have published clinical data and we are working with. And the reason we’re bringing Novartis in our prep remarks here is that’s a public clinical trial. One of the interesting things that’s happening here is there’s a lot of trials that aren’t public that are happening out there that obviously we cannot talk about. As we look forward, the important thing if you think about milestones, Anthony, to sort of to look at on this, sort of digital health option play if you like that we have in our strategy with the Propeller solution is when somebody goes from these pilot trials to a commercial trial and when they would allow us to talk about that publicly. And so, if and when that happens, that’s the milestone, I think that’s most important in a material element to our shareholders. As I said in the prep remarks, we got in early with Propeller and this is a long road. I think I used the analogy that it’s an ultra marathon. This is beyond just 26.2 mile. This is a huge journey. COPD number two cause for hospitalization and rehospitalization, the number three cause of death. It has such good runway for us in the future, but there’s nothing material in the quarter. And so, we’re just giving the update. We hit 100,000 patients. We think that’s fantastic. Right validation to have Novartis start its public study. It’s going to take a couple of years as Dave said. But I would expect that before those couple of years we will have some other milestones of going to some commercial trials that we can talk about in upcoming conference calls. But at the moment this quarter, Anthony, there’s nothing to report other than really good early data.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Good morning or good afternoon, Mick and Brett. I want to talk about the SaaS business making the tie-up with Cerner, I mean it suggests that they’re effectively leaving that post-acute space to providers like yourself. I’m just interested to know the – how much work needs to be done to allow for the two architectures to talk to each other. If you have a new electronic medical record for example in the acute space offered by Cerner, what work has to be done in terms of your SaaS business to allow those two systems to talk to each other. When do you expect to see the ability of the benefits of that tie-up to come through? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. It allows us to talk to the area of interoperability, which is incredibly important for us here at ResMed. We have 100 API calls per second from integrators into our air solutions ecosystem. So every second 100 interactions with another EHR, EMR whether it’s an individual person or myAir app checking the therapy or a physician at Massachusetts pioneer looking over 20,000 patients to do some management by exception protocol. And so, the Cerner contract or deal is that they – Cerner are looking for ResMed and really truly through our MatrixCare managed team to take care of home health and hospice customers for them. So they have customers that have hospital systems, but for the out-of-hospital part where it goes to home health and hospice, they want ResMed to be their partner to take care of those. And we think it’s a really exciting opportunity for the MatrixCare sales team and for the Cerner sales team to partner up and have that move forward. And it was really interesting at the Cerner conference to have our MatrixCare and Brightree teams there and all the technology available from the iPad app and all the capabilities that we have for home health and hospice and to get some really good leads. It’s not going to be material in the next 90 days for us, this Cerner contract, but the reason we’re talking about it is that idea of interoperability with Cerner, with Epic, with Allscripts, with all the players in hospital healthcare, we think it’s going to be really important that ResMed is the best person that can provide that handshake that API from someone in acute care to what they call post-acute care, but what we call out-of-hospital healthcare and we think that partnership is going to be really strong. So we’ll give you updates as the quarters progress, not just to the Cerner home health and hospice partnership, but to other partnerships with hospital systems, hospital providers and EHR providers. We think it’s a good milestone to show that one of the top three leaders along with Epic and Allscripts there in hospital EHR has chosen ResMEd as their home health and hospice care provider with our MatrixCare managed solution and we’re really excited about that.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Thomas Yeo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chris Cooper: Hi, there. It’s Chris Cooper on for Tom. And apologies if I missed it, but I didn’t hear much commentary on Mobi portable oxygen concentrator this morning and in your prepared remarks. Could you just give us an update there, please?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I’ll hand that to Rob.
Rob Douglas: Thanks, Mick. Yes, Thomas. We, as you recall, we launched Mobi very early this year and we’ve sort of been in a really still in a learning mode. It’s a great product. We’re actually learning a lot about the performance of the product and we’ve talked about and continue to validate the issue of the balance of the performance specifications and how the product works. And so, we’re in good shape there. What we’re also learning is that it is challenging through, particularly through the U.S. reimbursement model how to get the right patients on the right treatment and how to get that property funded and we have been trialing experiments in looking at ways to optimize and develop that. Really we’re learning a lot about what our sort of future pathways to market would be and how to – how can we make it best suitable for our HME customers to support patients and also what are the future needs of products further down the track and feeding learnings into our future roadmap. So with that all going on, the learning process is quite successful. We’re still not a major market share player with the product and that’s unlikely to change into the short-term future with the Mobi product that we’re currently investing and the way we’re heading at the moment.
Operator: Your next question is from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Mike Matson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about, there is a I guess a bill in Congress H.R. 2771 to kind of extend the relief from the bidding program that I think is set to expire into 2020. So just curious to get your thoughts on that and what that mean if that were not to be successful? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: I’ll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.
David Pendarvis: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, there is a lot of efforts under way in the U.S. Congress right now to try to provide relief, particularly the one you mentioned which is try to extend the relief that was given that was that sort of 50-50 blend between prior reimbursement and the new system reimbursement into those rural areas. We certainly support that legislation. We think it’s important that our customers who are operating particularly in extended areas where they’ve got to drive many miles to patients’ homes need to have reimbursement that reflects the operating cost that they’ve got and we would certainly hope that the champions that there in Congress will carry the day. Now as your question implies, there is a lot going on in the U.S. Congress these days. It’s very difficult to predict whether something like that will ultimately pass or whether CMS could respond on their own and provide that kind of relief. If it doesn’t, I think as I said before when talking about competitive bidding, we’ll obviously work with our customers to do what we can to support them. We think the remote capabilities of our devices are ideal for providing care to remote setting. You could do things like change some of the settings on a CPAP, you can certainly interrogate the CPAP for information about the quality of the therapy that has been provided, all without having to drive to someone’s home. So we think that those systems helping customers whether they are in rural areas or not to deploy them is probably the best thing we can do to help in that kind of a setting. But we’ll continue to support that legislation and other efforts with CMS to try to make sure that the Medicare policies and reimbursement is as favorable as it can be for the ultimate benefit of Medicare beneficiaries.
Mike Matson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Shane Storey with Wilson. Your line is open.
Shane Storey: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It’s maybe a bit tangential, but it relates to the CMS reimbursement changes that hit skilled nursing providers this month. Sort of weighing up that as an incremental opportunity for Matrix, I mean do you have an estimate of the proportion of providers that are yet to adopt good solutions there? And just interested to know, just how much growth there is, a scope sort of toward available for Matrix there in the SaaS market?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Shane. Thanks for the question. It’s a good one. There are changes in reimbursement not just in HME as we just talked about, but also in skilled nursing facilities and within home health and hospice. These provide excellent opportunities for Software-as-a-Service providers to – if you’re ahead of the game as MatrixCare was for the skilled nursing facilities changes as we are for the home health and hospice changes to be able to support customers through that change and even grow share because you’ve got the best solution that deals with those changes well. One thing I can say is that the new CEO there at MatrixCare, Steve Pacicco has formed great relationships with the customers and he has a great sales team that know the skilled nursing facility teams really well. And we’ve not only helped them through these changes in this quarter, but also set them up for success that our systems are operating well under the new reimbursement approach within those verticals. So that’s – when you roll that all together, it’s part of sort of that 2020 execution plan I talked about earlier that we see a good pop even if the blended rate of growth across these seven out-of-hospital healthcare verticals is in those high single digits. We think there are areas where we can get better growth than that. And we plan to exit 2020 with a double digit growth trajectory in the segment of SaaS. And part of that is going to be doing just what your question asked about, which is every part of the vertical, whether it’s skilled nursing facilities, whether it’s our new play in home health and hospice, the hunting license with Cerner in addition to our ability to grow share through having solutions that are ahead of the curve on reimbursement changes, they’re all opportunities to be able to grow faster and form longer partnerships with our customers.
Shane Storey: Thanks, Mick. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Hi, sorry. I just wanted to come back to Brett on the gross margin. You typically gave a bit of a range for that in terms of guidance. Are you able to do that again this quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Sure, Steve. I mean there’s a lot of moving parts, but I would think it would be broadly consistent with where we were for Q1.
Steve Wheen: Perfect. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Just a quick follow-ups on masks. I know you mentioned, Mick, a couple of launches. I’m just wondering how much stocking potentially there was in the quarter? And then just on lead item. Is there any – Dave, you mentioned, we spoke a couple of days ago, but is there any indication on how this is kind of coming in post the notification period? Thanks again.
Mick Farrell: Yes. So Anthony, I’ll take the first part of your question on masks and Dave will take the second part. Clearly we had excellent new product introduction over the last 12 months, but your question was around do people do stocking orders. Our U.S. distribution, and frankly, our global distribution partners are getting very intelligent about inventory management, not just those who use Brightree and have ResMed’s Brightree inventory management system, which will actually manage it for them, but many of them are getting really appropriate on that knowing when a new mask comes, watching how there r teasers setting it up and seeing the patient flow and making sure they don’t get too ahead of the curve or behind the curve. You don’t want a patient in the fitting room that wants the N30 and it’s not there, but on the other hand, you don’t want excess inventory because I have inventory carrying costs as everyone knows and our U.S. distributors are actually quite sophisticated on this. So I – obviously when some – you launch a brand new mask, people do need to make sure they got that mask on the shelf. But given the proportion of existing resupply patients, which is a very large portion, particularly the U.S. distributors patient flow, we don’t think there was material impact from stocking. Now, we don’t have full insight into our customers that aren’t using Brightree or other inventory management solutions, but we think it’s a pretty steady approach and we’ve done new product introductions over the 20, 30 years we’ve been in business. And I don’t – we haven’t seen that a significant rate before and I don’t think we saw any significant rate of that during the last quarter. Dave, the second part of the question for you.
David Pendarvis: Sure. Yes, thanks Anthony. I mentioned a little bit earlier that ResMed along with other industry participants put a lot of energy and resources behind trying to educate the market participants who are going to be bidding about various factors including lead item pricing and we developed a calculator that was put out. There were some stats that were just discussed in the Medtrade meeting just earlier this week in Atlanta that there were over 17,000 downloads of that calculator. And that’s just simply the one that was available to the participants here. CMS had their own calculator that folks downloaded. From the conversations that I’ve had, my understanding is that most DMEs have a pretty good understanding of lead item pricing and how it works. And hopefully they’ve avail themselves of the tools to be able to model out scenarios based on their own business and their own volume of products in different categories so that they can bid intelligently and in a way that’s going to ultimately derive a fair and reasonable reimbursement. So I’m confident that we got that message out that it was received. Obviously, we don’t know how people bid and we’ll work with customers as best we can to try to implement things when the day comes. But we are confident that we did what we could to try to educate.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks again.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Chris. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call this quarter. I’d also like to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in a 120 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. We will talk again with all of our shareholders in approximately 90 days. Talk to you all then.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Investor Relations or to me directly. As previously mentioned, all documents including the transcript and a replay of today’s call will be available on our website later today. Chris, you may now close the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-07-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2019 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 for ResMed. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I’ll review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. Reflecting back on fiscal year 2019, we have a lot to be proud of here at ResMed. The business is performing well; we past $2.6 billion in revenue and grew at double digits in the top line and the bottom line. We are exiting the year with momentum. And I feel strongly that we are well-positioned heading into fiscal year 2020 and beyond. ResMed is the world’s leading technology-driven healthcare company. We have more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices in the market around the world and our AirView cloud ecosystem monitors more than 11 million patient accounts, while our out-of-hospital software systems are helping to manage 19 million more. So, that is over 100 million lives that we improved with ResMed products, services and solutions in the last 12 months. We have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep and respiratory care data, which continues to grow exponentially. And we are turning these data into actionable insights that will inform future innovation in products and software solutions to further benefit our customers. Our relentless focus on innovation continues to set us apart from our competition, demonstrated by the success of our latest software releases and our latest sleep apnea mask systems that we’ve just launched. We have ambitions and strong ambitions to grow. We’re growing our business at -- volume at double-digits; we’re going to improve 250 million lives in 2025. We’ll do that by helping people live happier, healthier and high quality lives outside the hospital. We remain laser-focused on growth in our core business of sleep apnea as well as in our adjacent businesses of COPD, asthma, and other chronic conditions. We’ve extended our focus to include out-of-hospital software solutions that help customers create efficiencies, take costs out of the system and improve the quality of care across home medical equipment providers, home health and hospice services as well as skilled nursing facilities and beyond. In short, we believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital, that’s where ResMed competes and that’s where we win. Let’s briefly now review our top level financial results. I mentioned earlier that we ended the fiscal year on a strong note, and it is, thanks to our 7,500-person global team and their hard work to drive these great results. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 15% in constant currency. We produced constant currency growth in both domestic and international sales as well as in our software-as-a-service business, which is growing organically as well as through contributions from our recent acquisitions. We continued to deliver operating leverage through the business with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 18% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95. Let me now turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category across these two businesses, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, supported by 11% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies. We had 1% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and the rest of world. We continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in France and Japan as a result of digital health related fleet upgrade that we’ve previously discussed, and we will continue to do so for a number of quarters. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe. ResMed is well-positioned to continue to benefit from strong fundamental market dynamics, including an ageing population as well as increased awareness and attention from governments, payers, providers and physicians to better manage chronic disease. The masks and accessories growth of our business was very strong during Q4. We were up 15% in constant currency globally. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies, masks and accessories grew at 16%. And in Europe Asia, and the rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms, in masks and accessories. We are taking share around the world with our latest patient interface innovations. We make the smallest, quietest and most comfortable masks in the market. Results this quarter show the benefits of this innovation as customers vote for ResMed with their wallets. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 in the full face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category, continue their success across global markets. Our three most recent masks launches the F30, the N30i and the P30i have taken off at an incredible pace. These market share gains are complemented by higher rates of adherence, driven by our digital solutions and increasing adoption of mask resupply programs through the market. We have extended our mask portfolio to offer even more options for physicians and homecare providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. And while these new masks have a lot of runway ahead, we also have an exciting product pipeline for the future.  We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We now support well over 11 million patients with AirView, our cloud-based platform for managing sleep apnea and COPD patients. And more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices have installed into the market. Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment devices and full mask systems. Our industry-changing AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as patients and healthcare providers choose ResMed and physicians prescribe ResMed. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business and patient outcomes. We’re the market leader and we will never stop innovating in this field. We believe that digital health technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value and improve both critical outcomes and the patient experience. Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and Propeller, as well as supporting patients through their chronic disease progression, can altogether make a significant difference in both health outcomes and quality of life of patients. Through digital health technology, we are driving engagement with patients, so they can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available, and so the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by their physicians and other healthcare providers. The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. Using advanced analytics, we are turning these clinical data into actionable insights. We are lowering labor costs for our homecare provider customers. And we are taking waste out of the system through our focus on developing solutions to get the right healthcare product or service to the right patient at the right time. At the American Thoracic Society and at the Sleep Medicine Conference during the quarter, we presented over 40 clinical studies from our digital health databases. We are advancing the field of sleep medicine with doctors Nunez, Benjafield, and Armitstead, and their physician colleagues from around the world. Just over one year ago, we announced a joint venture with the Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, to study the health and financial impacts of untreated sleep apnea. Based on research outcomes from this JV, we will develop software solutions to help identify, engage and better manage people with sleep apnea. The JV has been set up and is running since November of last year and the combined ResMed-Verily team is making good progress to analyze data, code software, and to launch pilot studies into the market. This investment, which can be seen as a sophisticated, tech-driven research and development project is a great long-term bet. Over time, we know this work will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader ecosystem, covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other major chronic diseases. Everything we do supports our ambition to help to more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea, and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. In January, we closed on the acquisition of Propeller Health. This is a significant addition to our vision of longitudinal solutions in respiratory care. Propeller’s digital health solution helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma healthcare. Propeller rounds out ResMed’s portfolio to now treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease. As a reminder Propeller’s advanced digital health platform leverages small sensors that are attached to the inhalers of these medicines. These sensors then pair with an easy-to-use cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks COPD medication use and provides personalized feedback and insights to the individual, much like myAir and our other sleep apnea patient engagement systems, just not at the same scale yet. The Propeller team is making really good progress, as they work with partners to reach commercial scale. We’re very encouraged about where we are at with the team. There are few things that I can point to that give you an idea of how Propeller solutions have been recognized and adopted by their partners. In May, the Cleveland Clinic published research showcasing that the use of Propeller’s digital medicine platform for COPD patients, reduced the Cleveland Clinic’s COPD-related healthcare utilization and hospitalizations across their clinic. And the year before the study, patients averaged 3.4 visits per patient per year; following the use of Propeller’s technology, the rate decreased to 2.2 visits per patient per year, with the majority of patients indicating that the sensor was convenient and very easy to use. That 35% reduction in clinic visits is an incredible cost savings and productivity opportunity for hospital systems and payers. Earlier this week, Walgreens announced that Propeller has been added to the pharmacy’s health platform called, Find Care, expanding the ability to get Propeller into the hands of people struggling to manage their chronic disease through Walgreens. Propeller’s clinically validated solutions have demonstrated amazing outcomes, including trial studies showing a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, as well a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are impressive results, and we can’t wait to scale. The evolution that we have made in respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD, from stage 1 and 2 COPD with Propeller to stage 3 and stage 4 COPD, with portable oxygen and noninvasive solutions. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage COPD this important, progressive and chronic disease, keeping people out of the hospital, happy and healthy in their homes. Let’s now turn to a discussion of our software-as-a-service business for the out-of-hospital healthcare settings that we operate in. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory, with revenue up 111% year-on-year on a reported basis this quarter. On an organic pro forma basis, comparing results in Q4 to the results of these businesses before recent acquisitions, Brightree grew in the high single digit range and MatrixCare grew low double digits. We are pleased with the momentum and progress the teams have named as we integrate and optimize across the portfolio for growth. Our competitive advantages and leading SaaS positions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and other out-of-hospital care markets support ongoing portfolio growth. On a pro forma basis, we are growing this portfolio at high single digits across the blend of SaaS portfolio. And we have a clear pathway to drive sustainable, double-digit growth in our SaaS portfolio as we further integrate these businesses. I'd like to call out a few highlights from the quarter. Our Brightree home health and hospice electronic medical record solution was awarded the 2019 MedTech Breakthrough Award for best overall healthcare administration software. Additionally, our latest K L A S or KLAS scores for home health and hospice have gone up again. KLAS looks at many aspects of customer satisfaction, which provides a holistic measure of performance. So, the trend and these latest data further validate our leading position in high-quality offering in the marketplace. As you may recall, MatrixCare has received the best-in-class a long-term care software three years in a row. We have now organized all of our home health and hospice solutions from both HEALTHCAREfirst and Brightree under MatrixCare management. This will allow customers who operate across care settings, to enjoy the scalability and seamless transfer they want, but it also helps patients and aging seniors to navigate more easily across these healthcare settings. Additionally, we launched MatrixCare I which is a single platform for care management across out-of-hospital healthcare settings. Having a single platform, enables centralized management of care settings, consistency between functions, user management and navigation and a single view of the individual, resulting in streamlined care transitions for our customers. Also, during the quarter, Brightree launched a new pharmacy suite for home infusion therapy providers and HME pharmacies. We've also expanded our Brightree ReSupply solutions, three new categories, incontinence, diabetics and enteral to enable HMEs to create efficiencies and optimize patient support. In summary, for the SaaS business, we have a vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. ResMed is the strategic player, best positioned to lead this transformation. We are connecting capabilities across Brightree and MatrixCare platforms in care settings to help our customers to be more efficient, so they can better serve an aging population, helping them stay out of hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality care setting of their choice, and the best place is almost always their own home. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2019. Full year revenue was up 15% in constant currency, and we translated that into 18% operating profit growth. We are all well-positioned to continue to drive top and bottom line growth in fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We published the prevalence data study showing the 936 million people worldwide with sleep apnea in the top tier clinical journal, Lancet. Our connected health strategy continues to support growth across global markets and the continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with an expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out-of-hospital medical software markets. We have confidence in our ongoing momentum. Finally, we’ve position ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. Our triple aim is to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system cost, and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks. And then, we’ll open the lines up for Q&A. Brett, over to your in Sydney.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenues for the June quarter were $705 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S. and Canada and Latin American countries were $386 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234 million, decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 4% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $203 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $183 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $156 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 1% increase. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $79 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 12% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 4% while masks and other sales increased by 15% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-service revenue for the fourth quarter was $85 million, an increase of 111% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses, litigation and settlement expenses, tax related expenses associated with the U.S. tax reform and any payment on a minority interest investment. The prior comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. And replacing that, we provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 59.3% compared with 58.1% during the same quarter in the prior year and 59.3% in Q3 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling process. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2020 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY19 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $171.6 million, an increase of 9% over prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 3% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.3% compared to the 25.1% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% during fiscal year 2020. Consistent with trends in prior year, Q1 FY20 will be at the higher end of the range while with second half of the year will trend toward the lower end of the range. R&D expenses for the quarter were $51.1 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter, on constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflecting incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.3% compared to 6.4% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $23.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 102% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14.2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $196.2 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $137.6 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, consistent with the prior year quarter while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.48. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 28.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 will be in a range of 21% to 23%. During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $9.4 million, predominantly associated with the workforce planning review in our respiratory care business, closure of our R&D facilities in Germany and cost associated with ongoing integration program in the SaaS portfolio. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized a write-down of $5 million associated with a minority equity investment. Finally, in relation to legal settlement, we have tentatively agreed with the government to resolve the U.S. Department of Justice investigation for a payment of $39.5 million. We expect to also incur legal and administrative cost to typically accompany such a resolution. As a result, we have recognized a reserve of $41.2 million in our fourth quarter results in connection with this tentative agreement. While we believe a voluntary resolution is likely, there can be no assurance as to whether or when the parties will finalize a negotiated settlement. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $141.8 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.2 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $53.1 million. Our joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we've recorded equity losses of $6.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in fiscal year 2020, associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, representing an increase of 5% from our previously declared dividend. At June 30, we had $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. On July 10, we closed on our U.S. private placement offering with $500 million in debt, consisting of $250 million and seven-year senior unsecured notes at a 3.24% coupon and $250 million in senior unsecured notes at 3.45% coupon. Net proceeds from the offering were $498 million, which we used to reduce our current borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility. The transaction significantly lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides improved visibility on our long-term debt funding costs. Finally, to recap. Our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin was solid and our operating costs remained well controlled, even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q4 non-GAAP operating profit up 18% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic, long-term opportunities. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Brett. We will now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions or a follow-up, please feel free to return to call queue. Operator Rob, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Again, Lyanne Harrison, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Lyanne Harrison: Hi Mick and hi Brett. Thank you so much for taking my questions. It’s in relation to the SaaS business. Can you shed some light on how the growth was achieved, whether it’s new users, new module and increase in revenue per user? And also, how you might -- or when you might expect Brightree to get to double-digit growth?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Lyanne, thanks for the question. And as we said during the quarter -- or during the prepared remarks, during the quarter, we had strong growth across the SaaS portfolio, high single digit growth from Brightree and low double digit growth from MatrixCare with a blend of the two in the very high single digits. Your question of where the revenue comes from, it’s a combination of the above. We’ve had new users that come into the system, both Brightree and MatrixCare there is churn out but we have net new users that come in. We have also launched some recent new modules including apps directly for patients in Brightree. And then, we also have price increases that apply to some elements of that portfolio. So, it’s sort of a combination of all three that have driven that strong growth. And as we said, we think as we continue to integrate across the different out-of-hospital healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to increase the value we give the customers and therefore increase the revenue to a sustainable double-digit growth across that portfolio. So, we’re not giving a specific timeline exactly where that’s going. But now that it’s called out on our 10-Qs and 10K, we’ll be going through very detail data on a 90-day basis as to where that growth is coming from. But I can tell you, having just had a steering committee review with both the Brightree management team and with the MatrixCare management team just this week that we have a really good portfolio of new solutions and services, and new lines of business including getting into infusion businesses from Brightree, into enteral care and diabetics and beyond. So, there is a very good portfolio ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. 
John Deakin-Bell: Good morning, Mick. Mick, just give us a bit more of a sense from your perspective about the mask growth in the U.S. [Technical Difficulty] over the last 12 months, it certainly looks like it accelerated versus kind of the average over the last five years. And [Technical Difficulty] declined a bit the volumes, the volumes [Technical Difficulty] 15%. Can you just give us a little more perspective from what you’re seeing in terms of is that driven by the resupply? What are the key components of that elevated mask growth?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. That allows us to talk about what we’ve been doing to help our customers on masks and adherence and so on. As you noted, our U.S., Canada, Latin America growth in the quarter was very strong, was 16% constant currency in that geography. But I’ll note it was also 12% in constant currency in Europe, Asia and rest of world and so a sort of global number of 15% constant currency growth across the business. It’s driven primarily by market share gains, those high strong double-digit growth there. We say the market is growing in mid to high single digits. So, at 15% growth, we’re clearly taking share. So, that’s one point. Secondly, what we’re driving is increased adherence. As I talked at length on the prep remarks on digital health technology, we’re driving upto 87% adherence on patients who set up on a ResMed device using myAir and all the Air Solutions capabilities. And so, 9 out of 10 people are staying on therapy, and so that just drives a stronger tail of the number of patients who will adhere to therapy and therefore will need masks as they get dirty and decay over time. So, that’s a big part of it. So, it’s the share gain, it’s the adherence that we’re driving and it’s also getting new patients into the funnel. And we’re doing a better job of identifying, engaging, enrolling patients around the world, not just by publishing the prevalence data that we just did but using the big data to partner with healthcare providers and governments and payers to show that there is a return on investments in diagnosing and treating sleep apnea patients, not only improving the quality of life of the individuals and their lives changed and lower incidence occurring disease but also directly to lower healthcare costs for government insurance and private insurance as well. So, it’s sort of a combination of all three, move people into the pipeline, the pipeline expanding through adherence and also ResMed gaining its share of that pipeline through the mask innovation.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. 
Saul Hadassin: Maybe could I just ask, resupply seems to be a very strong driver of growth in the U.S. from masks and accessories. We’ve seen the part of bundling program effectively come and go. Do you see any risks at all from a payer’s perspective, the reimbursement perspective, the sustainability of funding of that product growth?
Mick Farrell: So, the key element in this is really Health Economics and Outcomes Research, right, and the acronym is HEOR. And one thing we’re doing with the 4.5 billion nights of medical data we now have on sleep apnea and COPD patients is partnering up with healthcare systems. You saw our data with Kaiser Permanente Group in California, which is where we published the 87% adherence data. Obviously we don’t share all the partnerships that don’t get published and what we’re doing. We have talked about the latest work with Walgreens in there with Cleveland Clinic on some of our digital health applications. The bottom line is, if you keep a patient on therapy for sleep apnea and you’re investing a couple of hundred dollars per year per patient on masks, you are saving far more than that in reducing emergency room visits, additional cost for cardiovascular care, diabetes and all those that from untraded obstructive sleep apnea. So, we’ve had decades now of clinical data showing this. We now have true economic data that we can show a customer, where that customer is a payer provider system like [indiscernible] with the government of Finland, and look at data in their system with their people. So, your question was, do I see resupply as a risk? No. I see resupply as an opportunity to show the return on investment for the people who are trying that. But actually this is a cost saving, a net-net cost savings over the life of that patient with their own data, retrospective and prospective.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.
Steve Wheen: Hey. Good morning. I just wondered if you could go back to that settlement figure and just remind me of what the issue was. I think, this is related to that OIG issue. And does that change -- is that just an estimate at this or is it being finalized? And secondly, does it change the way you've got to run that resupply business, going forward?
Mick Farrell: Steve, I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas.
David Pendarvis: Steve, the conduct that was subject of investigation, has been laid out in our 10-Qs over time, so, if you just go back and reference that, will give you the detail that basically has sort of four different categories. How we made our resupply programs available on a trial basis was one element. There were issues about marketing programs, issues about financing and issues about making some apnea links available. So, all four of those would get wrapped into this resolution. It is a tentative resolution. And so, we are comfortable in taking the reserve now because we think it’s probable that that resolution will get finalized. But that's likely only to occur, our best estimate now would be by the end of the calendar year that that will take place. And we are pretty confident of the numbers. The 39.5 number that Brett referenced is a confident estimate of the ultimate exposure for payments to the government. The remainder of it, the fees and expenses are a little more of an estimate, but there is a pretty high confidence level that that reserve ought to be sufficient to cover all of these expenses associated with it. Importantly, we are not going to be required in this resolution to admit any wrongdoing. In fact, we believe that we have handled ourselves appropriately. But, like in a lot of situations, you resolve matters on a consensual basis to get it behind you. And we feel it was the best resolution for our customers, our patients and for the Company and our shareholders. But going forward, we don't expect any significant changes to the way that we do business. We're going to continue to remain focused on, as Mick was saying, making resupply systems available for customers, so they can get -- patients can get adequate supplies and consumables in the future. We will still do that and in the other areas providing support to our customers and support to our patients. We don't expect any significant changes in the way we do business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Margaret Kaczor: Mick, on the frontend commentary, I think you had referenced your goal of double-digit volume growth over the next several years. So, I wanted to maybe go into that a little bit more, in terms of the drivers of that growth, sleep, versus COPD versus SaaS, if you plan a similar pace of product launches, maybe that we've seen, and really when does the law of large numbers, whether it’s healthcare or resupply certain impact you?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Margaret. As you know that I did talk about that in the prep remarks that the way we look at our businesses is, it’s exciting, the $2.6 billion in revenue, but just as exciting, probably more exciting for the people who work here is the 100 million lives we touched, 15 million through products and now over 90 million through our services and solutions in the SaaS part of the business. So, our goal is to grow that combined portfolio double-digits in volume through 2025 and beat 250 million lives that we improve in the year 2025. So, that’s sort our five-year growth plan. We haven’t split -- I mean, we have obviously internally, we haven’t publicly split out exactly how the different elements of sleep apnea, respiratory care, primarily through COPD but also asthma now through Propeller and then also through the out-of-hospital software side and how each of those elements will grow. What I can say is that sort of core market of sleep apnea is growing mid to high single digits, as you saw this quarter and last quarter. We don’t just accept market growth, we drive it by getting market share and getting new patients into the funnel to actually fundamentally improve that core sleep apnea market growth. In respiratory care, we are revolutionizing the whole space there with the acquisition of Propeller. It will only take one of the three to five non-public pharma pilot trials that we’re doing to go to scale for that growth of that business to improve very significantly from its current run rate. And we’re betting on that happening. We have a very exciting set of partnerships with big pharma that we can only talk about at the appropriate time. And then, the third part of our business, the combination of Brightree and MatrixCare businesses, as I said, we have a clear pathway to drive those from high single digit to double digit growth, and to sustain that over time. I mean, people want to be taken care of outside the hospital, and we have the best software systems to do that. So, there’ll be secular trends moving people from the hospital to hospice, home health, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and so on, and ResMed will beat to improve on all of them.  So, we’re going to go across each of those portfolios and then lots of different factors over the next five years that will drive it. But we’re very confident, we’ll get double-digit volume growth across that portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Gretel Janu: Thanks. Good morning. So just on SG&A, you continue to lower that SG&A to sales ratio. Just wondering, like where do you see that going, how long can you continue to actually continue to lower it, and where exactly are the gains coming from?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Gretel. I‘ll handle to Rob Douglas, our COO.
Rob Douglas: Yes. Thanks, Gretel. The really good thing in our volume growth business -- we were talking earlier about the volume growth, is sort of engineering leverage into the systems and process is not that hard to do, if you really focus and keep going. Obviously, our sales processes and all of our sort of systems and the way we work do need continued investment. And we can’t promise we’ll be getting leverage forever. But while the volume growth is strong, we’ll continue to be efficient and drive that. Obviously, you did see in our organic business, we got very good leverage. And as we’ve brought in the new businesses that maybe haven’t had some of that sort of leverage thinking applied to them, that sort of added on quite a bit. But they have remained then huge opportunities to build leverage with some of the thinking around the process management and the continuous improvement programs that we’ve got. So we’ve got -- we’ve still got plenty of headroom to keep driving that leverage.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Your line is open.
David Bailey: Mick, just one for me. Just wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense as to the contribution of non-invasive ventilators to devices revenue for the group?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, David. We don’t split it out to a granular level of detail. What I can say is, in general, if you look at sort of the growth of respiratory care in ventilation versus a sleep apnea care and the device growth, it’s a little lower in respiratory care as a sort of a secular growth rate. And so, again, we don’t just accept that and say well that means our non-invasive ventilators will grow slower than our sleep ap devices. But, it is something that is generally there from the secular trend. We actually -- this last quarter and before that, David, we had really strong growth in our ventilators. We made a software upgrade. And this wasn’t a cloud offer, this was actually embedded software that is within the Astral ventilator that was really well-received by customers in Europe and in the U.S. And so, we saw some pretty strong market share gains that drove good growth in devices in both Europe and in the U.S. from our ventilator side of the business. But, we don’t split it out yet. I look forward to when Propeller is so successful driving the digital health side that we have to break out our respiratory care division the way that we do our SaaS division and at that point I’ll be able to give you a whole lot of the color into the ventilation part of the business. But I can say, it grew well this quarter. And we think that software upgrade has more legs on it and has some more growth ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jeffries. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: So, maybe just a question on -- I’ll just keep it to one, on France and Japan. You mentioned that connected devices is there, the upgrades seem to be completed. So, is there an expectation France, Japan to sort of normalize after those upgrades are completed? And if so, what extent do you think the benefit can be as a tailwind as those two countries normalize on the device side? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. That allows me to talk about that digital health upgrade in France and Japan, which was incredible to see the rate at which two countries move into digital health. As you said, we will start to normalize as we pass all the comparables of that ahead of market growth that we’ve had in our rearview mirror. Look, what I’d say is that by the end -- before the end of this fiscal year, we will normalize France and Japan, and really that will influence across that whole portfolio of Europe, Asia and the rest of the world that we report on. We’ll start to see that whole group normalize to market growth.  And then, hopefully, as we launch more of these digital health solutions into countries beyond France and Japan, that we’ll be talking about the s-curve of innovation of digital health in Finland and in Switzerland and in Germany. I don’t have announcements on any other countries beyond those two. But, I look forward sort of working through the intricacies of the other 120 countries we do business in as they embrace digital health, the same way France and Japan did. But the short answer to your question is, by the end of this fiscal year, before the end of this fiscal year, we would expect that out of U.S. device growth to normalize.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs.
Chris Cooper: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the expansion of Brightree into other areas outside OSA. Can I just ask the rationale for the three areas you’ve chosen? And also, could you just confirm, this is something you’re going to continue to roll out across the other areas of healthcare? And if so, over what timeframe, please? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Brightree has an incredible cloud-based enterprise resource planning and systems planning capability for home medical equipment companies. And they've actually always been able to, from our acquisition of them over three years ago to today, serviced beyond just sleep apnea and COPD. We've been servicing patients with incontinence, diabetic and enteral at different levels. What we really decided to do was to bring our resupply capabilities that we first applied to the ResMed side of the business, which was masks, over to those other areas of business. And so, it's not really expanding Brightree’s footprint in terms of which customers it goes after. It's more expanding the services that we offer. Now, with the infusion, the growth of infusion business, that does bring some players in HME who have that -- infusion part of their business brings that into play for Brightree. But I consider it more of an adjacency. If you think about it, the core growth of Brightree is in home medical equipment provider. And everything they do can be digitized and can be put on the cloud, and that's Brightree’s goal, and it was before we acquired them and it has been after we acquired them. And I'm just happy to see that we didn't just focus on sleep apnea and COPD growth for HME providers. We are actually thinking holistically about their business. And these new launches will allow Brightree to grow its very profitable part of the business, but also to serve those customers better and to bring more efficiencies to them which will help for the health of that distribution of home medical equipment in the U.S. and really help our partners grow, and it’s good profitable revenue from ResMed as well. So, I’d say, it is a very strong, good adjacency and a good part of our ongoing growth.
Chris Cooper: And this is a strategy you’re going to continue to look to push going forward?
Mick Farrell: Yes, absolutely, Chris. We’ll look to continue to find opportunities for home medical equipment providers to get efficiencies. So, if this part of the business that are analog, that are fax based, I mean, you wouldn’t believe some of the opportunities for innovation are actually quite relatively simple and we have solutions. For instance, our e-fax [ph] solution to just digitize that whole space and help doctors and home care provides more easily integrate with each other, stuff that just is on the pipeline that we really have to get the solutions out there and get customers adopting those new modules. But, as I said earlier, I think we are seeing some good adoption in modules, and we have a good path to continue that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO. Please go ahead.
Matt Henriksson: Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. My question is with regards to the partnership or the agreement with Walgreens. Could you provide a little more detail into how many patients now you’re opened up to using Propeller? And then how important are these pharmacy partnerships going forward for the overall Propeller strategy?
Mick Farrell: So, thanks for the question, Matt. As I said in the prep remarks, the partnership with Propeller and Walgreens is a pilot trial, like all of our Propeller trials are in that pilot trial stage. It’s exciting because it’s a new place at the pharmacy for Propeller to acquire new customers into the digital health platform that we have for COPD and for asthma. So, it’s not public how many pharmacies and how many patients are on that platform. But generally, with Propeller’s data, when we get to the end of a pilot, we’re able to publish those data to get them into the peer-reviewed press. And at that point, I’ll be able to talk very liberally about those data, but I don’t want to jeopardize the production or publication of those data. But, what I can say is if you look at the data that we had with other partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic data that we did talk specifically too, a 35% reduction in the number of clinic visits or a double-digit reduction in the visits to emergency room visits, these are, depending on the size of the business, if you’re a large hospital system or a large payer, these are tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that can saved across the scalable business. And so, it’s early days of pilot data. I don’t want to talk too much about the numbers until we really do start to scale it. But, I think it’s important to note what -- where we want to go with digital health and COPD. And the Walgreens experiment I thought was worth sharing because it’s a new sort of place to find these patients that goes beyond sort of the traditional doctor. We’re now talking a pharmacy clinic.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on competitive bidding, obviously the bids are now open for ‘21. I’m just trying to understand if you’re saying to think about that and how you might pass yourself or what sort of thought process you might have going into that?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks for your question, Andrew. We have a very sophisticated market access team looking and governance -- is looking at this. Dave, do you want to give a summary where we’re with CB?
David Pendarvis: Sure. So, even though the bid windows open, it’s going to be open for 90 days. And so, the main thing that our team is doing now is continuing to work along with others in the industry to educate the industry to make sure they understand new rules of bidding and how to understand, how to think about it, how to model the impact of lead item pricing on your overall portfolio of products and to make sure that our customers are in the best position they can be in to be able to go forward and bid appropriately. So, that’s really the first, second and third priorities today and that will continue. We’ve seen an uptick in the number of people who have visited the website, the number of people who are attending seminars as we’ve gotten into the bid window opening period. So, that’s the main thing that we’re doing. Beyond that, we’re obviously trying to make sure that our customers who are the ones, who are putting the bids in a position to do best they can and make the best estimates they can for what they can do going forward. So, we’re trying to support the overall process, but we’re really secondary to it. So, we’ve got to be in a support role, primarily.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
David Low: Thanks very much. A bunch of questions for Brett on the restructuring charges. So, we’ve seen restructuring come through for the second year in a row. Just wondering how you think about restructuring. Is this going to be something that we’re likely to see on ongoing basis? And how do you distinguish between what’s the restructuring charge and what falls into sort of regular SG&A and R&D costs?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean, with any business, I think from time to time, it’s inevitably that you have some restructuring coming through. But I don’t think it’s going to be something that’s routine or it’s necessarily going to happen all the time. I guess, we distinguish anything that’s kind of logical program, it’s really something that we’re structurally challenging. So, the elements that we’re looking at in respiratory care, we really have to look at on strategically the workforce planning and look at what capabilities we need, particularly as we move and focus more around the digital health. And you heard me talk about the Propeller and what we’re doing there, and it’s really making sure that we have those capabilities. So, in order to do that, really we need to look at workforce planning every now and then and strategically, if you like, make some calls, and we’ve done that this quarter in respiratory care. The other elements for the German R&D facility, which is small legacy system that we basically selected to close that down. They did good work there but we -- it is kind of subscale, we’ve got -- as you know, we’ve got the major hubs, Sydney, Singapore in the U.S. So, we really thought we could do that more effectively at the larger hubs. That’s something that’s kind of more permanent in nature, if you like. And then, SaaS, the third element on the SaaS restructuring is really related to the integration activities, particularly around the home health and hospice segment, we’re really strongly integrating that portfolio. So, again, that’s something that we’re doing in SaaS that I think will only happen time to time, we’re really aligning strongly around HME and then around home health and hospice and then around MatrixCare with some segments such as the skilled nursing facilities. So, there again, it’s really positioning that portfolio to operate technically as it can from a revenue growing perspective and also from clearly -- obviously from a cost related expected as well. So, I think, from time to time, it’s inevitable, but I don’t think -- it’s not necessarily going be routing. We’re not going to have these every quarter, for example.
Operator: Your last question comes from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sean Laaman: Good morning, Mick. Mick, I’m wondering if could tease out a comment on the rate of Brightree users buying other Brightree users during the quarter, and was that an issue?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Sean. Looking at U.S. home medical equipment channel, there’s many thousands of providers, and Brightree has a very strong double-digit share of those many thousands of providers, and there has been over time and will continue to be M&A. And so, yes, during the quarter, there was M&A I’m sure. I can’t think of a particular example in my head but I'm sure there were examples of Brightree -- accounts who’ve used Brightree service acquiring other accounts who use Brightree. As you know, we generally charge that business on a per user per time period methodology. And so in general, if there two accounts come together, it could be neutral to revenue. Now, there can be some efficiencies, or it could have been one of those businesses using more modules or less modules. And so there could be many factors that either increase or decrease the revenue from the account during that process. But, it’s something that’s there, it’s part of the business. I'd say less of an impact on things like churn, where you just have people -- new people coming in and people switching to other solutions or turning off some of automated solutions. But, it’s part of that business and we've managed that over the history, three plus years we’ve managed Brightree and the entity and the team there managed it for their last 10 years that they’ve been in business as well. So, it’s part of the equation but it’s not something that's new and it’s not something that we're unable to manage. And I think you saw during the quarter strong single digit growth that we were able to do well and we thing we can even do better from there.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Rob. And before we close the call, I want to thank our dedicated 7,500 strong team here at ResMed for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and all the operating excellence initiatives. You folks are the core of what we do and your efforts have enabled us to deliver these great results that we just shared with our shareholders. We’re focused as a team on our future pipeline and all the products and software solutions we have to improve outcomes and benefits for all of our stakeholders, that includes patients, includes physicians, payers, providers, governments and of course our shareholders. Thanks all for your time today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the first quarter for fiscal 2020.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you all again for joining us today. If you do have any additional questions, you can always reach out to Investor Relations or me directly. As previously mentioned, all the documents and the transcript will be available on our website later today. Operator, Rob, you can close the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-05-03 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2019 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Julie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thank you, Julie. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Julie said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who is with me here in Sydney, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. Before I get into the details, I would like to discuss ResMed's long-term strategy and our goal to include $250 million lives in 2025. Driven by a number of macro change such as an aging population, the increasing impact of chronic disease, chronic healthcare costs and a move towards digital transformation in healthcare. We see very exciting opportunities for ResMed. Our goal is to empower people to live healthier lives outside of the hospital. Today there were a numerous pain points in existing care delivery models and in the quality of patient care that ResMed can address. You'll know healthcare costs are growing faster than GDP in many countries. And there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated. When you couple that with the difficulty of getting the right care at the right time, delivering that health care in low cost setting and even further changes in challenges with interoperability, documentation, and clinical data availability. It's a global healthcare system that is in the costs. When solutions in a microeconomic side, with ResMed's global leadership in digital health for sleep apnea or COPD and for outside of the hospital healthcare, we believe that these are problems that ResMed can solve faster and better than our competitors, providing superior value for our customers. With that backdrop, I would like to quickly review our financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth. We were up 12% in U.S dollar terms, and up 15% in constant currency terms. We benefited from a full quarter of revenue contribution from one of their latest acquisitions, MatrixCare. We also drove constant currency growth in domestic as well as international device styles. Additionally, we had a very strong growth in masks and other accessories. Now I will talk some of the new mask orders a little lighter. We delivered operating leverage with Non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a lot of about 89 things. We are proud of the top line and bottom-line performance from the global ResMed team. We expect to continue that success as we maintain fiscal discipline and invest in long-term growth of the global ResMed's business. Now let's turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. And with MatrixCare businesses. In the device's product category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 6% globally, supported by 8% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America in the category. We also achieved a return to constant currency growth for devices in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in both France and Japan, which were as a result of the digital health related reimbursement changes in those countries let drove the acceleration of the vast fleet device upgrades as the last number of quarters. Underlying patient activity in all geographies remains very healthy. The masks and accessories side of our business was robust during Q3 growing globally at 13% in constant currency. In the U.S., Canada and Latin American geographies, masks markets grew at 13%. And in the Europe, Asia, and rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms in masks.  We continue to see excellent traction with the AirFit F20 in the full size category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. Our recent mask launches of the F30, the N30i and the P30i are all doing very well. Let me provide a little bit of color on each of these innovative products. During October we launched the AirFit F30. This is an exciting innovation in the minimal contact full-face mask category. In January, we announced broad availability of our first tube up mask, the AirFit N30, which is in the nasal category. Both of these new masks, the F30 and the N30i contributed to our strong mask growth in Q3. After quarter end, just last month, we announced the launch of the AirFit P30i. This is a new tube up pillows options that complements our highly successful over many years P10 masks. I have personally worn ResMed's nasal pillows technology for my own sleep apnea care every night for many years. A few years ago I thought nothing could beat the Swift FX, the pillows technology. Then I upgraded a few years ago to the P10. I’m now looking forward to personally upgrading to the P30i, which has freedom of movement and the ability to enjoy better sleep. We believe that many other type sleep apnea patients not just the CEO, who have the same excitement after experiencing the P30i. All these recent mask launches are important additions as we expand our mask portfolio to offer even more options to physicians and home care providers and are ultimately for the varying needs of the ultimate customer, a person who is suffocates every night. We remain focused on driving innovation to make underserved customer needs. We have an exciting product pipeline. We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We announced supporting well over 10 million patients with AirView, our trial-based patient management system. And more than 9 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices in the market. Over the past 12 months, we've improved the lives of nearly 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD devices and full mask systems. Our industry is changing, AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as healthcare providers and patients choose and physicians prescribe ResMed solutions. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business, efficiencies and patient outcomes. We are clearly the market leader, but we will never stop innovating in this space. The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. This was twice as many nights as we had just a year-ago. We're truly driving exponential digital health growth. Using advanced analytics, we are turning this clinical big data into clinical actionable insights. We are focused on developing solutions to get the right healthcare, to the right patient, at the right time. And always more cost-effectively for all our customers. Everything we do supports our ambition to help more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As we expand our digital health platforms, one of that goals has been to take the success we've had with myAir and AirView in sleep apnea and replicate that within our respiratory care business vertical. Did I -- many patients with COPD and other respiratory condition, aren't getting the treatment that they made until it's too late. There are some frequent fliers at the hospital. We believe that technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to that ultimate customer, on their own smartphones and supporting patients through their the COPD, the disease progression to make a huge difference. Through digital health technology we are driving guidance with patients so I can benefit from the best therapy before it's too late. We've made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for noninvasive ventilation. And with Astral devices that have cloud connectable options for lot support ventilation. Noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions, three, -- Stage III and stage four COPD patients. Those were the insights of this dreadful disease. To meaningfully drive improved patient and clinical outcomes, our strategy growth and products had expanded to take a more holistic longer tubular view of the CFE patients journey. And to offer solutions for therapy and support through earlier stages of COPD. So that we can be there for the COPD patient from stage 1 all the way through to stage IV4 of their disease. In early January, we moved Mobi, our premier portable oxygen concentrator, to a full product launch. Mobi best meets the needs of users and what to be mobile and enjoyed healthy active lives outside their home. Early results have met our expectations. We are about to commence sales of Mobi through our German team. In the U.S., we are working in partnership with our HME customers to grow this category, the healthcare system reimbursed patients. And to use portable oxygen in situations where portable solution benefit the patient must. We also continue to test pilot and refine other potential go-to-market models with the ultimate goal to ensure that patients has the most efficient mask to a portable oxygen solution. We expect the POC category to grow given very strong patient demand. We also expect that revenue will grow its share within the POC category. I want to be clear that we will take a long while for POC to be material mixed through our core sleep apnea and our core ventilation device businesses. So it's a long road ahead, During the quarter, we added another significant element to our vision for longitudinal solutions in Respiratory Care when we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in January. Propeller's digital health solutions, help people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma. We are hoping with this new addition to round out ResMed's portfolio to treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease as I mentioned earlier. But that was sophisticated digital health platform leverage a small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical and higher ones. Along with a sophisticated cloud-based mobile application that automatically tracks the medication use and provides personal feedback, coaching, and insights to the individual, much like our sleep apnea patient engagement system just north of the same scale. Propeller's clinically validated solutions have demonstrated incredible outcomes. Including a 58% improvement in pharmaceutical adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free guide, a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are truly impressive pilot results and we cannot wait to scale them. In the same way we scale our digital medical device, ecosystem in sleep apnea and COPD to now 4 billion nights of medical data. Propeller is operating as a standalone entity with its dynamic and innovative management team is doing quite. It's gone through in San Francisco. We are working with the propeller CEO, David Van Sickle, and his team to continue their momentum towards commercial style with the pharmaceutical customers as well as their health insurance customers. We had a board meeting last month and I’m going to tell you I’m very encouraged by the progress we are seeing. Earlier this quarter, Propeller announced publicly a partnership with Orion, which is a pharmaceutical company in Finland, and we’re going to connect the propeller digital health platform to align easy and hyaline for both asthma and COPD patients. Propeller Health is at the beginning of converting from pilot to scale and commercialization. We will empower the team to grow and to scale and bring all our skills to the table. The opportunities are vast. There are more than 60 million diagnosed COPD and after half of the patients in the United States and major markets in Europe alone. Maybe these patients could benefit from Propeller Solutions and Propeller is the clear leader in digital health for inhaled pharmaceuticals. The evolution we’ve made in our Respiratory Care business, I think is game changing. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD from stage I and stage 2 as well as our existing client Stage III and Stage IV COPD. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage this important progressive chronic disease. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of our software-as-a-service business. And then I will hand over to Brett. The software-as-a-service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 101% year-on-year on a reported basis, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and Healthcare first along with the first full quarter of contribution from our acquisition of MatrixCare. On a pro forma basis compared to results in Q3 to the results of those visiting businesses before the acquisition, Brightree is growing in the mid to high single-digit range. And MatrixCare is growing at the low double-digit growth range. Overall we see significant growth opportunities for these fast [ph] businesses serving the out of hospital healthcare space with a lot of runway ahead. The total addressable market is over $1.5 billion in out of hospital SaaS in the UNITED alone. Without competitive advantages and our leading positions in multiple SaaS verticals, we expect ResMed SaaS portfolio to move from high single-digit pro forma growth to low double-digit pro forma growth over the medium term and to be sustainable at that rate for the long-term.  We’ve started the process of integrating some of our SaaS portfolio assets. We recently transferred leadership of our home health and hospice offerings from Brightree and HEALTHCARE to under the MatrixCare management team. That will combine our strength in home health and hospice with private duty and beyond. This move will allow us to accelerate our product innovation and deliver a wide range of features for customers who have businesses across these verticals. It also supports our strategy of driving improved patient outcomes and business efficiencies for customers across all out of hospital healthcare settings. As our SaaS portfolio grows, I would like to reiterate the promise we made when we first acquired Brightree back in 2016. We're committed to protecting our customers business sensitive information. We’ve firewalls to do just that. I founded ResMed in 30 years ago. In 1989, the company was founded on the fundamentals of honesty, integrity. You’re doing the right thing forward. That’s what we’ve always done and what we will always continue to do. We’ve a vision to transform and significantly improve out of hospital healthcare. We have a strategy to enable better patient care, improved clinical decision support and drive interoperability across these healthcare settings. The acquisitions we’ve made of the past year, established ResMed after strategic player who is best positioned to lead this transformation in out of hospital healthcare. We now offer software solutions across out of hospital healthcare settings, from home medical equipment to home health and hospice to skilled nursing facilities, to senior living, to private duty and beyond. We're connecting capabilities across these platforms for these care settings, to help our customers be the most efficient they can be, to ultimately better serve people, to keep them out of the hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality setting of their choice as they age. And the best place is often their own home. Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered. We are building an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help individuals, aging individuals move seamlessly between these healthcare settings. So that they and their loved ones can receive optimal care and optimal quality of life with frictionless moves wherever they live. In parallel to helping individuals we will drive superior outcomes. So physicians, pilots and providers. We’ve built the portfolio, now it's up to our SaaS team to execute and ultimately deliver on the promise of this strategy. At the highest level, the mission of ResMed in our 2025 strategy is impact and improve 250 million lives in out of hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier and a higher quality lives in the comfort of their own home. Our advantage comes from our focus on tech driven integrated care, from sleep apnea and COPD awareness to diagnosis, to treatment to management and then to ongoing therapy and healthcare management of chronic disease with digital health solutions. Let me close with this before I hand over to Brett. We’ve delivered a strong quarter. We are well-positioned for continued success throughout last quarter of FY 9. We are just in and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with our expanded lifeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea and COPD and out of hospital medical software, gives us confidence in our ongoing momentum as we look to the future. We’ve positioned ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. So we are just getting started. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open the ones up for Q&A. So over the table here in Sydney to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $662.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15%. Taking a closer look that geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our thousand U.S , Canada and Latin American countries with $350 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $232.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $191.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Mask and other sales were $168.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $155.2 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 3% increase. Masks and other sales were $77.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms a 12% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales were increased by 6%. while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.  Software-as-a-Service revenue for the third quarter was $79.9 million, an increase of 101% over the prior year quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree healthcare and MatrixCare businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measure adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, and purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue and tax related expenses associated with U.S tax reform. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles tax, related expenses associated with U.S tax reform and restructuring expenses. We’ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 59.2%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting in the third revenue adjustment, now gross margins for the march quarter was 59.3% compared to 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. And 59.1% in Q2 FY19. Compared to the prior year and our adjusted gross margin increased by 110 basis points predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. The MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 50 basis points. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the reminder fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $164.5 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 17%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter.  Looking forward and subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% to the balance of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $47.6 million, an increase of $0.27 over the prior year quarter or in constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflect the incremental investments across R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.2% compared with 6.3% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% of the balance of fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles $22.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 95% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense in the quarter was $12.8 million. Non-GAAP, GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $128.1 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S dollar which were partially offset by the weaker euro. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 23.6%. On a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%.,We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 21% to 23%. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $139.6 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $15.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $41.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 53 million. On January 7, 2019 we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health for consideration of $225 million net of cash acquired and that assumes a joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we recorded equity losses of $6 million in income statement in the March quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately 7 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2019, and also in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity and interest rate movements, I would like to update you on our expected net interest expense. Our net interest expense in Q3 FY19 was $12 million, and going forward we expect to record quarterly net interest expense in the range of $12 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. At March 31 we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $4.1 billion and net equity was $2 billion. Finally, in summary, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin is improving, supported by the contribution from recent set acquisitions and our ongoing efforts to drive [indiscernible] efficiencies as well as favorable product mix. Our operating costs remain well controlled even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q3 non-GAAP operating profit, up 15% year-on-year. We're focused on driving solid operating results, while ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. We will now turn the call to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you do have additional questions, you’re free to return to the call queue. Julie, we're now ready to start the Q&A section.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on the line with the question.
Michael Farrell: Sean, you might be on mute.
Sean Laaman: Yes, great. Hello. Can you hear me?
Michael Farrell: Yes, you need to start from the start, Sean. You were on mute, I think.
Sean Laaman: Yes, sure. Yes. Okay. Mick -- well, hope you’re all well everybody. On the rest of world masks, so strong number there. Were you able to talk about or give us some granularity around your experience for the upgraded devices in France and Japan and sort of how much runway is there to go on the benefit on that resupply side of the equation?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a good question in terms of -- allow me to talk about France and Japan, what we’ve done there. Look, clearly global revenue growth in masks was exceptional in the quarter, 13% constant currency globally. 13% in the U.S. Canada and Latin America and 12% across Europe, Asia and rest of world in constant currency terms. So we’ve had probably 4 to 5 plus quarters of upgrades in France and similarly in Japan. And as we said in the prepared remarks and we said last quarter and the last number of quarters, we are going to be facing a headwind of the device sales in both France and Japan, although we're now through to get a modest positive on the rest of world devices this quarter. But it allows us through that upgrade of digital health assets in both France and Japan to now start interacting with patients and driving patient behavior through apps like myAir and with physicians through solutions like AirView and the whole Air Solutions portfolio. And so we believe there's long-term sustainable mask growth that we can achieve in both France and Japan that should help continue to grow out share which is quite high already in those geographies. But look, we are not done with it. We -- obviously, in the last five years, brought digital health in the United States and now to France and Japan with 120 other countries worldwide that we now need to start that opportunity on, but yes, it's certainly great growth in masks in the quarter off the back of digital health, but also off the back of some great mask launches.
Sean Laaman: Sure. Thanks, Mick. And just one follow-up. A lot of activity there with the integration of the software platforms. Just wondering though qualitatively or quantitatively if you could give us some description on some of the financial benefits of those, that integration process that we might see?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Sean, look we always think about that driving investment in digital health technology and it drives such good growth of the core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care devices. And as I’ve mentioned just now also growth of the core masks and accessories. We have a lot of internal models. I’m not prepared to share how those internal models of digital health technology are catalyzing growth of those areas that’s what I’m prepared to talk about is our public segmentation of the SaaS business which is powered by the same digital health technology capability. And that part of that portfolio grew a 101% including acquisitions. But as I said on the pro forma basis, it was growing at high single-digit range and we think over time we can optimize that digital health tech and that SaaS portfolio to grow in the low double-digit on a sustainable basis as we look at multiple years towards that 2025 strategy, we think that’s a big part of it. Thanks for your question, Sean.
Sean Laaman: Yes, thank you, Mick.
Operator: Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse is on the line with a question.
Gretel Janu: Hi. Thanks very much. So just on rest of world devices, would you be able to give a little bit more about the breakout in terms of the performance of Japan and France in the third quarter? And then just in terms of the other rest of world countries, were there any other surprises in results?
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Gretel. Look, I -- we don’t -- we already breakout a lot of information when we say all the different categories we go down to, but I’m happy to talk -- put some color on to the Europe, Asia and rest of world countries. Look, as I mentioned in the prep remarks, it was a great expansion in France and Japan these last number of quarters. But that great expansion and extraordinarily high share that we’ve achieved there now means that you’re going to slow down in both [indiscernible] have already been upgraded on the device side. Look, yes, as we saw the total Europe, Asia, rest of world growth was in that sort of modest positive on the CC and slightly negative on the headline number the U.S dollars given currency movements. Look, we expect that part -- that aggregate portfolio to grow in that type of rate as we move forward. There will be some lumpiness up and down over time, but the device side of that portfolio is given -- a little up and down in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world over the next number of quarters as I think we addressed last quarter and most of sell side analysts have put in there. But as we move forward and we start to lap those fleet upgrades, we will get back to what we are doing, which is core patient growth. That is very strong in both France and Japan and throughout the rest of the countries we have there. And that’s what’s the real determinant of long-term growth. How do we get 900 million people suffocating to realize they are suffocating and getting into the system talk to their doctor and get diagnosed and treated. And that flows need to be pretty steady in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. So, yes, there will be some lumpiness in device sales here as we left France and Japan, but we will get back to growth. But yes, -- so I’m not going to give detail on China, Germany and all the other countries until and when there's a digital health upside in one of those countries and then we will become material element and I look forward to doing that really.
Gretel Janu: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: David Low from J.P. Morgan is on the line with a question.
David Low: Thanks very much. If we could just start with the commentary around the Software-as-a-Service business. Mick, you’re suggesting that they return to low double-digit growth is the medium-term or long-term aspiration. I was just wondering if you would talk a little bit to Brightree versus the long-term postacute care space? Would I be right in assuming that the long-term postacute care growth opportunity is quite a lot larger than Brightree just given how immature it is?
Michael Farrell: Yes, I think -- look, there's runway still ahead, David, in the core Brightree business of home medical equipment. There's just so many efficiencies that we can have their, but yes as you know as I’ve said, the quarter mid to high single-digit growth. I don’t think we can get that path, even just a Brightree path to the high single digits and probably not brushing up and touching the low double-digit growth within that Brightree home medical equipment segment, because this is just so many efficiencies to gain. A little bit of market share again, we’ve good market share. But it's more about bringing in modules the capabilities that take [indiscernible] away from our home medical equipment companies and bring such values that we can then share in some of that value creation. But, yes, look, the $1.5 billion addressable market includes many other out of hospital verticals. We are already playing in around seven of them and at scale at least through, like we’re in home health and hospice at scale now. I’m really excited about the Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare assets all being combined. And John Vanguard and his team out there in Minneapolis, I think they’re going to do a great job in that vertical, home health and hospice. And additionally that same team working in skilled nursing facilities where we already have a strong position, but a lot of runway for growth. I think one of the things that ResMed brings that’s unique is we're a strategic player and we’re going to converting capabilities like cybersecurity, our management of AWS, Azure and all the cloud-based systems around managing that digital portfolio that we can bring superior value to it. But look, it's really a portfolio, Brightree will be a good part of that growth. MatrixCare will be a good part of that growth and we’re looking to continue to grow as we empower that team. Roger has been doing a great job.
David Low: Great. Thanks very much for that. Just my other question, big picture the growth that we saw from ResMed, like in your traditional sleep business looks very strong across but devices and masks. I think we would hesitate or extrapolate that out in rest of world as well, if you want to pull out the impact in France and Japan. Just would like your thoughts on where the market growth is picking up, or whether you think this is being a large or significant contribution from market share guidance?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's interesting, David. And you’ve followed the same other companies that I did to try and track it. We got some really good market share data in some of that geographies and less good in others. Look, I look at out at this quarter we had constant currency growth of devices globally 6% and we had constant currency growth of masks of 13%. Traditionally, we say and I think it's still true that devices sort of growing in that mid-single digits and masks going at the high single-digits. So that would imply that we took some modest share in devices. Obviously, geographies outside France and Japan we already took the share there. And in masks, I think the N30i, the F30, we didn't even count any of the P30i, but that 13% growth is -- its clearly including some share growth as well. We love the game of innovating, small, quiet, more comfortable, more connected devices. It's a competitive game that, yes, we are winning more than we’re losing. Thanks for your questions, David.
David Low: Thanks.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee is on the line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Good morning and thanks very much for taking my question. Just on Mobi, you haven't called that out separately, just if you could characterize any contribution or feedback around the quarter? And also your move to go direct-to-consumer with OEM for Mobi?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Andrew thanks for the question. As I said in the prep remarks, the whole POC category, even if we had a 100% share, we would struggle to be material to our business. We are starting from a very early stage, Mobi, we’re just sort of flipping to a full product launch as we move forward. And as I said, we’re very closely partnering with our home medical equipment provider customers. And what we are looking to do is find patients that qualify, and if they qualify for the reimbursement versus Medicare or private insurance, we are working with our HME customers to provide that lead, if you like that person who is in need of a POC and to have them provide great care for that person. Two of our competitors have been -- one of them for many years and one for a period of time, experimenting with models that completed the genre on that reimbursed business and going direct to patient. We have stayed away certainly from competing with our customers in the reimburse business in the United States. It's not our game and we have been doing that plan to do that. In the case that a person who wants to buy a device by cash, we are at quality in different models, we've been, in the way the two competitors are. I think it would be foolish not to take care of the ultimate customer who is a patient, who needs when two other players in the market are doing that. But it's very early days in this. I’m going to say that the opportunities that is huge for us and we think of it as a longitudinal play across COPD. POC is an interesting part of a big journey of a COPD patient. We want to talk to the patient in stage 1, stage 2 through digital health and inhalers. That’s about 80% plus of the cost of the COPD patient is in the pharmaceutical side. So Propeller Health is the one that we should be talking about as a material element. I think with POC, noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, we are already in that. And it's exciting, but it's really that long-term play of the patient through digital applications [indiscernible] of hospital, to keep them happy, so that their physician's happy, that the health insurance company is happy, that the caregiver, everyone is happy and also that our customers are under and [indiscernible] equipment customers can be happy. As a reimbursed patient, we want to take care of it.
Andrew Goodsall: Very good. Thank you. And just my follow up, just obviously GM, half of that was -- you attribute to metrics. The other half I presume is predominantly mixed with the higher growth in the U.S?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, hi, Andrew. It's Brett. The -- it's probably -- there is meaningful impact probably from the some production efficiencies in Q1 efficiency [indiscernible] that we’re driving for maybe would like 30, to add. And then obviously product mix was favorable, and that was a meaningful impact on that as well.
Andrew Goodsall: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for your questions, Andrew.
Operator: David Bailey from Macquarie, is on the line with quarter question.
David Bailey: Hey, good morning. Just a quick one for me. [Indiscernible] up on the gross margin, just wonder if you can quantify the impact to currency on gross margin on a year-on-year basis.
Michael Farrell: Yes, year-on-year was favorable around COPD POC license points. And in -- at a sequentially it was basically pretty negligible.
David Bailey: On the context of the 50 basis points your refer to early are you probably looking around 10% -- 10 basis points organic gross margin expansion with the year-on-year. Excluding currency?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, and actually on currency, it's actually pretty negligible on both actually. If I look at year-on-year, correct that. It's pretty eligible [indiscernible]. And really [indiscernible] because we still [indiscernible] to see the all these are real types of [indiscernible] I would call for the [indiscernible]. And lastly I said [indiscernible].
David Bailey: Okay. Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from UBS is on the line with a question,
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning. Just one question from me. Mick, the U.S. masks growth rate [indiscernible] ahead of market growth again. Can you talk to how much of that is resupply growth, an acceleration in resupply as opposed to success on new product launches. I mean, we have the impression that masks that redeployed the vast majority of your U.S [indiscernible] you talk to what you’re seeing in the dynamic between resupply growth versus share shift that would be great.
Michael Farrell: Yes, that’s a great question. We have Jim Hollingshead, the Head of our Global Sleep business on the line. Jim, you want to talk to as much cover you can gave on U.S growth organic etcetera.
Michael Farrell: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick, and thanks for your question, Saul. I think the answer is both in. We are seeing very strong results of resupply and we’ve seen that over the last several quarters as more and more of our HME customers have adopted automated resupply solutions. So that continue to be very strong. return results for us and for customers with the new products have also -- all gotten off to a terrific start. F30 is out of the gate very strong, N30i has a terrific patient preference and is doing very, very well and early result from P30 are also extremely encouraging. So I think we are getting both organic growth and we are taking some share in this space, but we’re also enjoying very good results for the resupply.
Saul Hadassin: Thank you.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question.
Joanne Wuensch: Good afternoon everybody and thank you for this quarter after the last quarter experience. Anyway two quick questions. What was the total acquisition revenue impact on the fiscal year third quarter. And then the second question is how do we think about operating leverage in the coming quarters and maybe even for next year? Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Well, I will jump to the operating leverage, I will hand to Brett to talk about sort of organic versus acquisition driven growth. But look Joanne as we’ve been -- as you and other sell-side analysts have challenged us, that is, one is the ongoing leverage. And it's really our challenge to ourselves to ensure that we can achieve ongoing leverage and I think we’ve had a good performance in the last number of quarters to that end. The operating programs, the business excellence programs, we put in place the drive with [indiscernible] manufacturing team, the [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing teams that I'm here on site with this week are all doing excellent work in that. Our commercial teams and looking at how to use digital health technology for the social media marketing versus old-school paper and television, really pushing the envelope of how we drive business excellence across all that functions in all our business verticals. It's something that we think is sustainable for the medium to long-term. But it's a game that never stopped throughout the game of continuous improvement and Brett, do you want to have a little discussion as to what’s organic versus inorganic growth in the quarter.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Joanne, you’re talking on the SaaS side?
Joanne Wuensch: A number of acquisition in the last 90 to 180 days, , MatrixCare, Propeller, et cetera. Just I'm trying to piece through where all that came from.
Brett Sandercock: Yes if you look at -- on a group basis, if you look at -- growth you exclude the acquisitions, we grew at around the 8% mark constant currency. I think a good way to look at it, Joanne, is that masks -- the devices and masks and accessories -- none of those acquisitions came with us. So if you think of device growth year-on-year constant currency at 6% and masks and accessories growth year-on-year 10%, that gives you an idea for absolute core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Excluding all acquisition about -- that happened.
Joanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Joanne.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking the question. For my question, I want to focus a little bit on Brightree and some of the strategic changes may be that your guys trying to make to accelerate revenue there. And part of that is really the number of recent product and program launches that you have. So how should we view the typical sales cycle for some of these new product launches? Is it six months, nine months? And then can you give us a sense of where that revenue growth is going to come from new users versus existing accounts?
Michael Farrell: Great question, Margaret. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, Chief operating Officer.
Rob Douglas: Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Margaret. Margaret, you know that Brightree is recurring revenue model. So we compete on booking and that then reflect in recurring revenue on the U.S. So we do have a view of that. And as we talked about, we had headwinds around a little bit of consolidation in the industry. Our approach to that has been really improve modules on it and we’re really happy with the way the new Brightree modules are going, including some of the analytics offerings and certainly some of the direct patient engagement offering in Brightree. We’ve got the team really focused on driving those offerings in the market. And then even on a longer term basis, we've got the team working on additional modules and development. So we are very confident that that Brightree growth will continue as it did in this quarter. We saw a decent improvement in that and we are confident that will continue.
Margaret Kaczor: Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret.
Operator: John Deakin-Bell from Citi is on the line with a question.
John Deakin-Bell: My question is just around Propeller. Last quarter you said that was going to be $0.02 to $0.03% dilutive third quarter for some time. Can you just confirm that that is the case in this quarter? And just give us an update on the trajectory of that -- of the losses over the next year or two?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Brett, do you want to talk to the losses …?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Sure, John. Yes, so I can confirm that it was in the $0.02 to $0.03 range for this quarter. And I guess for the next little while next few quarters I think it will around that sort of level.
John Deakin-Bell: That's fine. I mean, like for the whole of FY '20 is that -- are we talking about that length of time?
Brett Sandercock: I mean I don't want to make progress that sort of long-term predictions like that on Propeller but I think for the next few quarters it will be around that level.
Michael Farrell: The real question, John, is where that goes from down a penny to up a penny is the sales cycle of Propeller. So Propeller, as we said on the prepared remarks, are working with Orion in Finland, sort of niche pharmaceutical company. Its public that the Propeller are working with some very large pharmaceutical companies and some of them don't want us to talk about, some of them are in the archive. But if anyone of these pilots starts to commercialize, that stuff -- and they are comfortable for us talking about that publicly, how customer is, we will update you on that. And this will be very quickly from dilutive to accretive in a heartbeat, but that's obviously the play. It's a medium to long term play and we are not calling the date, the time or the hour or the quarter that, that happens. But that’s what the investments are around, so that’s where it like sort of as we start to get out there, those changes may happen. And so for the short term, [indiscernible] things down. For the long-term, incredibly excited for COPD patients to get better Digital Healthcare.
John Deakin-Bell: Right. Good color. Thanks for that.
Operator: Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.
Lyanne Harrison: Good morning, gentleman. I just got another question on your SaaS business. And you mentioned previously about the home health market and Brightree and MatrixCare. Can you actually shed some color on how we should be thinking about the revenue synergies in the -- in your SaaS business with Brightree and MatrixCare and also on HEALTHCAREfirst?
Michael Farrell: Yes, it's a good question. And the combination of those businesses, there is a number of factors. I mean, sort of basic one is that we can combine our digital health capabilities, our cyber security, cloud-based management and management team and sort of the economies of scale managing across those multiple portfolio. The big upside is that there are a number of customers, may be many thousands of customers out at hospital healthcare, that operate in multiple cities. They have a skilled nursing facility. They also have a hospice and maybe also a home health. And a lot of the players out there are small and or niche players in -- as in terms of our competitors in the SaaS space and they serve one or maybe two of those verticals. I think as ResMed now serves seven verticals, we are able to have frictionless or seamless moment of an aging person from care setting to care setting. That's good for them. It's good for the family. It's good for the health care system. It's good for the insurance company and its good for the customer. The person who is signing us on a per year to per month basis. And so that’s the real upside. The synergies is on the backside, on the backend of the infrastructure, but there is also incredible synergies for the customer in ResMed being an offering that goes across those. And so we are actually [indiscernible] Healthcare first, allow us to really put it all under one umbrella and bring that value to the customer.
Lyanne Harrison: Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Thanks for your question, Lyanne.
Operator: Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question.
Chris Cooper: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been asked, but perhaps if I may probably just ask one on the growth opportunity in POC since you mentioned that. Just curious if you could share your thoughts, please on how big you believe that our addressable market might be, and also what you see is a current market growth? I know you expect to outperform that through share gains, but if you could just give some sense of how big that market is and how quickly you believe it's growing right now, that would be helpful for us. Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Yes, Chris, as I said in the prep remarks, it's going to take a long time for POC to get material versus other -- $2 billion plus franchise, but it is exciting as kind of the [indiscernible] top line. Rob, do you want to give a little more data as to the addressable market and/or to that share.
Rob Douglas: Sure. We’ve talked about addressable market over the years saying that $ 3million to -$4 million range. But it's actually changing a lot because as we’ve talked about, POCs are a disruptive play to other forms of oxygen delivery. But in order for that disruption to really play out there are a few generations of technology needed. But we could see a strong market growth in that market and particularly as we introduce connected solutions and better management of products and better really management of patients. So long-term we see a lot of opportunity in growing that market, but as Mick has said in the short-term, it's going to take a long-term to be material, particularly given the growth rates of our other businesses. And we are happy with our current programs. We are really focusing on learning and the best way to support patients in the market and the best way to use the capabilities of our existing partners throughout in the market.
Chris Cooper: Got it. Thanks. Just one very quick follow-up. Just on the masks side, if you were to apportion or rank their contribution that you would expect from the F30, the M30i and the P30i, over the next few quarters could just give us some sense of how big you expect each of them to be relative to one another.
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, we don't go into that level of detail around new masks set up versus existing or new mask growth. But what I can tell you in terms of color is we are very excited about the initial performance of the N30i and the F30. They have shot out of the gates beautifully. The P30i wasn’t even in the quarter which is launched last month. I’m looking forward to opening the packet and using it myself. And I can't wait to see many, many, many others do the same. But yes, we won't that right out, but I can tell I this growth in the quarter of 13% constant currency in masks and accessories wasn't a one timer. I think we have the ability to continue to grow pretty strongly with this really strong portfolio we have.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick for closing comments.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Julie. And before we close the call, I would like to thank our dedicated 7,000 strong ResMed team in a 120 countries for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence and business excellence initiatives.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-01-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2019 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks Chris. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. The call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. Joining me on the call today to discuss our results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call after our prepared remarks. During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ.

I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Michael Farrell: Thanks Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. First, the top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth, up 9% constant currency or up 10% on a non-GAAP basis globally. Even as we observed the expected impact on European and Asian device sales as our customers completed the cloud connected device upgrade programs in France and Japan. We delivered strong operating leverage and we achieved non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. We continue to maintain fiscal discipline and invest to grow the business for the long-term. Let me provide a few highlights across our global sleep apnea and global respiratory care businesses. It has been nearly four and a half years since we launched the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform. As we've discussed before, we are upgrading the capability of our software systems, including myAir and AirView with new features every two to four weeks. Based on this customer value, we continue to grow our device market share in the quarter as healthcare providers and physicians and patients are choosing ResMed due to the fact that these digital health solutions improved both business and patient outcomes. We are leading the industry with digital health technology, supporting well over 9 million patients within AirView, our cloud-based patient management system, and more than 8 million 100% cloud connectable devices now in the market. Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of well over 40 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment products. We are pioneering the path forward as we utilize digital health technology to turn big data into actionable insights for patients, for physicians, for homecare providers, for payers, and beyond. We now have over 3.5 billion nights of sleep apnea and COPD treatment data in the cloud and that growth continues to be exponential. Using advanced analytics, we are focusing on developing solutions to get optimal healthcare to the right patient when it is needed. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic lung disease. As we expand our digital health platforms, one of our goals has been to take the success we have had with myAir and AirView within our sleep apnea vertical and replicate that within our respiratory care business. We have made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for non-invasive ventilation and Astral devices with cloud connectable options for life support ventilation. We needed to add digital health solutions for inhaled pharmaceutical for COPD that are utilized in the earlier stages of COPD disease progression in the medical devices and that also constitute more of the treatment cost than the medical devices. To this exact point, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Propeller Health and the deal was closed just a few weeks ago. Propeller's digital health solutions helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma. Propeller has a sophisticated digital health platform that leverages small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical inhalers along with the cloud-based software system and cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks medication use and provides personalized feedback as well as insights to the individual. Propeller has critically validated solutions that have demonstrated a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, and a 53% reduction in emergency room visits to the hospital. These are astounding data and we cannot wait to scale these relations with our new pharmaceutical partners. Propeller's ability to support people in Stage II and Stage III COPD are very complementary to our existing suite of cloud connectable ventilators for those patients with Stage III and Stage IV COPD. The combination is powerful. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD and help people as they manage this important progressive and expensive chronic disease. Propeller has been an incredibly successful company to-date and we continue to operate as a standalone entity. We have retained the extremely dedicated management team and we expect their momentum with pharmaceutical company customers to continue. ResMed brings long-term financial stability and has proven itself as a company that can operate digital health systems at scale and across a global portfolio of countries. Propeller and ResMed, we are going to be powerful partners together. This partnership completes an important piece of the puzzle for the ResMed 2025 strategy, providing a clear roadmap for global leadership in digital health for COPD. Switching back now to talk about our core operations. On the devices side of our business, we achieved 7% growth in The United States, Canada, and Latin America. Including the impact of the completion of digital health upgrade systems in France and Japan, our global growth in devices was 3% on a constant currency basis. While we have been thrilled with the digital health reimbursement changes in France and Japan during 2018 and they will have great long-term benefits of increased adherence in mask sales in those geographies, we expect that the impact in France and Japan will be present for the next few quarters. We will then return to market growth in devices within France and Japan and above market growth within those geographies after that. Outside of these two countries, our device growth was strong during the quarter and we expect that to continue as we move forward. Last quarter, we discussed that Mobi, our new portable oxygen concentrator would move to a full product launch sometime in our third quarter and we made that official launch just earlier this month. We are working in full partnership with our home medical equipment customers to help grow this category and we are excited to bring the product to market that optimizes the balances of key features such as size, weight, and oxygen output. We believe that this product best meets the needs of oxygen users who want to be more mobile and enjoy healthy active lives outside their homes. Customers will vote with their wallets and we expect that not only this POC category will grow, but also ResMed will grow its share within the POC category. Although it will take a quite a while for this business category to be material next to our core sleep apnea in ventilation device businesses. The masks and accessory side of our business grew at 10% in constant currency on a global basis during the quarter. The U.S. Canada and Latin America geographies grew at 11% in masks and accessories. We are continuing to see great traction with two of our flagship products in this category, the AirFit F20 in the full-face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. We are seeing strong growth across all geographies for these two masks. Last quarter, we also launched the AirFit F30, an exciting innovation and what we are calling the minimal contact full-face mask category. Initial customer feedback on the F30 is incredibly positive and we have a lot of runway ahead for this product. Earlier just this week, we announced the broad availability of our newest mask, the AirFit N30i. This is an important addition to our portfolio in what we are calling that tube-up design nasal mask category. With the N30i, we have further expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options to homecare providers and ultimately for the varying needs of individual therapy uses. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved and unmet customer needs. The F20 and F30 as well as the N20 and N30i form a powerful portfolio to address these customer needs. Let's turn now to a discussion of our Software-as-a-Service business. We announced and closed the $750 million acquisition of MatrixCare during the quarter. MatrixCare is an incredibly fast growing and profitable business that brings ResMed into a number of new verticals within the out-of-hospital healthcare software space, including skilled nursing facilities, senior living facilities, life plan communities, and beyond. We also completed a technology tuck-in acquisition called Apacheta, which will help drive increased growth in our core Brightree software business. The Software-as-a-Service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 63% year-on-year, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and the full quarter contribution from HEALTHCAREfirst along with partial quarter contributions from MatrixCare and Apacheta. We have a vision to transform out-of-hospital healthcare and these acquisitions have established ResMed as a strategic player in the best position to do so. We have a proven track record of transforming our market through SaaS-based software and solutions and we have demonstrated success and experience with Brightree these last three years. We now offer software solutions across an even broader portfolio of out-of-hospital healthcare settings from home medical equipment to home health to hospice to skilled nursing facilities to senior living to private duty and beyond. We are helping our customers in each of these care settings to be the most efficient that they can be to ultimately better serve people and keep them out of hospital and in a low cost, higher quality care setting, often in their own home. Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how our healthcare is delivered and received, leveraging an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help the person seamlessly move between care settings that they can have optimal care and optimal quality of life wherever they're living. In parallel to help individuals, we will drive superior outcomes for their physicians, payers, and their providers. We have built a portfolio, now it's up to our team to integrate our technology and business workflows, and ultimately, to execute and deliver on this promise. Now, I'd like to spend a little time talking about our global business excellence programs. We have a dedicated team of over 6,500 ResMedians that delivered another quarter of double-digit net operating profit. This is now the sixth quarter in a row of driving operating leverage. A key benefit of this operating leverage is that it provides us the flexibility to invest money back into our innovation teams so that they can help us drive sustainable long-term revenue growth. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 15% in the quarter combining revenue growth and expanded gross margin with disciplined investments in SG&A as well as in R&D. We are taking a controlled and thoughtful approach to manage the business for the long-term. We continue to invest in our business to deliver strong organic growth. Before I turn the call over to Brett, I'd like to discuss briefly the ResMed 2025 strategy. As we look at the macroeconomic environment in healthcare, the burden of chronic disease is increasing. We have an aging population; nearly 9% of the world's population is age 65 or older. And by 2050, that number will almost double to 17%. So, that will be 1.6 billion people over age 65 around the world. We all know healthcare costs are growing and there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated today. Couple of these data with issues such as the pain points of getting the right care to the right patient at the right time, delivering care in lower cost settings, and challenges with interoperability, documentation, and data availability. It's a global health care crisis. But on the microeconomic side and within our sphere of influence, which is in digital health for sleep apnea, digital health for COPD, and out-of-hospital healthcare software, we believe these are problems that ResMed can help solve. At the highest level, the mission of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to impact and improve 250 million lives in out-of-hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier, and high-quality lives in the comfort of their own home. Our advantage comes from our focus on tech-driven integrated care from sleep apnea and COPD awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment and then ongoing therapy and healthcare management with digital health solutions. Our joint venture with Verily is an example of partnering to drive identification, engagement, and enrollment of sleep apnea patients early in their journey. We will help more and more of the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate with sleep apnea each night to find a better pathway to therapy, leveraging partners, and partnerships such as this. Let me close with this. We have delivered another solid quarter and we are well-positioned for continued success throughout 2019 and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified and growing mask and device portfolio along with an expanded and expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions to sleep apnea, COPD, and the out-of-hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum for our business. We're applying ResMed's growth and innovation in the key chronic diseases of sleep apnea and COPD, as well as innovation in software for out-of-hospital healthcare. We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top and bottom-line growth into 2025 and beyond. By enabling better care, we are improving quality of life, reducing the impact of chronic disease, and lowering the costs for consumers and healthcare systems around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open up the line for Q&A session. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $651.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $358.5 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $229.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 1% over the prior quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; U.S., Canada, and Latin America device sales were $186.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $172 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales were $156.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 2% decrease. Masks and other sales were $73.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 3%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service segment revenue for the second quarter was $63.3 million, an increase of 63% over the prior quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare businesses. Note that MatrixCare acquisition closed on November 13, 2018. So, we had recognized MatrixCare revenue and expenses in Q2 FY 2019 from this date. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, a purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue, and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms. In the prior year comparable, this excludes amortization acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for December quarter was 68.9%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting deferred revenue fair value adjustment, our gross margin for the December quarter was 59.1% compared with 58.2% in the prior year quarter and 58.3% in Q1 FY 2019. Compared to the prior year, our adjusted gross margin increased by 90 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product mix, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for second half of fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY 2019 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $161.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 8%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25.2% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% for the second half of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $43.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses decreased by 1%, reflecting lower clinical trial expenses in the current quarter relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared with 6.8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movement and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $16.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $181.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $144.5 million consistent with prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1 consistent with the prior year quarter; while GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.86. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar, which were, however, substantially offset by the weaker euro. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.5%, while on a non-GAAP basis; our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates benefited from our higher than usual tax benefit of $13.1 million associated with employee share-based payments transactions during the quarter. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 22.4%. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $129.5 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $36 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. Given our recent acquisition, we have suspended our share buyback program. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter. During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of MatrixCare for consideration of $750 million. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share with an initial quarterly incremental benefit of approximately $0.01 per share to the second half of FY 2019. Additionally, on January 7, 2019, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in consideration of $225 million. We now expect Propeller Health to have a diluted impact on our quarterly non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter for the second half of FY 2019. Associated with these acquisitions, we also incurred acquisition-related expenses of $6.1 million in the December quarter. Our joint venture with Verily commenced operations during the quarter and we contributed an initial $25 million in cash to the joint venture entity. We recorded equity losses of $3.4 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in the second half of FY 2019 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity, I would like to update you on our expected increase in net interest expense. For the second half of FY 2019, we expect to record net interest expense of approximately $14 million per quarter, reflecting our increased debt position as a result of our recent acquisitions. At December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1.05 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.9 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham: Great. Thanks Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.
David Stanton: Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. I guess just wanted to talk a little bit more about the acquisition of Propeller Health and just run through the synergies between Propeller and the base business. I know you talked to that to some extent, I wonder if you could then outline and give a little bit more color, please. Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Yes, David, it's a really good question. So, as I said in the prep remarks, Propeller is really that missing puzzle piece. When you think about digital health for COPD, for lung disease, medical devices in total constitute about 15% of the total cost and 85% of the costs is in the pharmaceutical side. Now, clearly, we're not getting into the manufacturing or distribution of pharmaceuticals, but what Propeller does allow ResMed to do is to participate in the digital health that every time someone clicks and takes a puff on their inhaler, a sensor sends data to the cloud that either chronic or acute medicine has been taken for that COPD patient. So, this gets us to a digital health portfolio that covers all the way from Stage II lung disease through to Stage IV lung disease. And as we build and we've talked about building a digital health portfolio to -- the true aim here is to improve quality of life, keep patient in the home, especially out of the hospital, you need to be across that whole portfolio. So, we're just really excited. Propeller Health has relationships with GSK, with Boehringer Ingelheim, and they are working on all the major COPD pharmaceutical companies and forming partnerships with them. And ResMed brings to the party a number of things. We've have operated digital health at scale across our sleep business and we're going to do that here in respiratory care. We operate in 120 countries worldwide and have digital health in many, many countries worldwide, and we're going to help Propeller with that. And we're really supportive of the management team. They are very linked to ResMed's culture, which is focused on patient, keeping them out of hospital and improving care. So, as we look forward to Propeller over the coming a year, two or three, you're going to start to see ResMed create digital health solutions for COPD that are going to change and bend the cost curve of hospitals and healthcare systems, and particularly, for the patients themselves. And -- so we're really excited to have this part of the team.
David Stanton: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Yes, good morning. This is for Brett. Just wanted to talk about the gross margin and trying to break down a bit. Obviously, lots of moving parts here. You gave us the MatrixCare contribution, are we able to try and take out the different components? In particular, I wanted to look at FX in the quarter? And what that might look like going forward given the quite of big ships more recently? And then previously you have mentioned what sort of manufacturing efficiencies contributing to the gross margin, so any color there would be great.
Brett Sandercock: Sure Steve. I mean FX for the quarter year-on-year was not -- was pretty small, it's probably in the range of 20 basis points. I'm going to call that MatrixCare and the other kind of contributed equally meaningful will be manufacturing efficiencies and also favorable product mix. So, we're starting to see that come through particularly with our performance in masks. So, that's certainly helping. On the manufacturing pharm efficiencies, procurement, and so on, I think things are improving kind of cycle-times and production efficiencies over time, but I think we're also benefiting now from pretty good volumes coming through and pretty good recoveries on the production side of things, incremental volumes kind of hitting up to Singapore as well and we're getting some scale benefits there. The combination of those factors I think are leading to some good manufacturing efficiencies that have been flowing through over the last few quarters.
Steve Wheen: Okay. And FX then going into future periods, is that likely to be a driver as well?
Brett Sandercock: So, currently where we are in terms of euro, if I look forward and just look at it sequentially, I think we still get a small benefit; it's probably only going to 10 to 20 basis point mark unless you saw obviously waiting from wherever at. The currency wherever they are now, I would estimate probably sort of 10 to 20 basis points tailwind for us sequentially.
Steve Wheen: Okay, got it. And just finally on the -- just wanted some clarification on equity accounted losses. Could you just repeat the future quarter impact, didn't quite catch that? And then where is that coming from? What particular acquisition is driving those debt equity?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Sure. That's our Verily joint venture. So, we need to take out in terms of debt accounting losses associated with debt equity. For this quarter, it was $3.4 million and I estimate for the next few quarters, I would say, Q3 and Q4, that will be around $7 million per quarter.
Steve Wheen: Okay. And does that turnaround or what's driving that loss?
Brett Sandercock: The JV at the moment is thing about more of a kind of a startup phase if you like. So, it will be kind of expenses that are coming through initially. Obviously, that JV was quite pretty high, I guess, in terms of what it can do; particularly being able to, let's call it, the $936 million patients out there. I think about it is as being able to identify with those, information is engaged with those patients, many of those patients on therapy. So, kind of think about it like that as pretty big opportunities there, but at this stage, the JV is exploring those and obviously, they will pay some money to do that initially. Yes, ultimately, we expect that to turnaround for sure.
Operator: Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon folks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the growth outside of the Americas and specifically, maybe outside of France and Japan. So, if you guys can provide any kind of color underlying demand, any potential competitive changes, any catalysts that maybe we should look out for? And then as you kind of look at that growth outlook going forward, what could drive it above or below the results that you guys reported this past quarter in total? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Thanks Margaret, that's a good question. So, looking at our rest of the world market growth, I just want to make this point right up front. The patient growth in terms of the growth in both France and Japan and all the other countries we do business in, has been very good during this quarter and we expect be continued in strong growth as we look forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond. So, patient growth is really strong. We did have well above market growth in the last number of quarters as we had the digital health and connected health upgrades in France and Japan. And as we said last quarter and the quarter before on this call and in Q&A, we expect that that impact to change and then that's present in those numbers. So we're saying for the next few quarters, France and Japan will be slow for a couple of quarters and then we'll get back to market growth and then ahead of market growth through the fact that we now have an installed base of digital health devices out there that should drive greater adherence and therefore greater use of masks and accessories within France and Japan and beyond. So, in terms of the other -- during the quarter the growth in other markets outside France and Japan and U.S. and Canada, we saw excellent growth. We are not going to go through individually exactly what we saw in different countries in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, but we saw really good underlying growth on the device and on the masks side. So, look we are very excited about our global growth in devices as we look forward not just rather fiscal year, but into next fiscal year.
Margaret Kaczor: And any specific commentary as it relates to the growth profiles in the next year, two years, where excluding the tax that can help accelerate the growth or whatever have it go down? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes, we don't see it's going down. I mean look, we know the global growth in this market is in the mid to high-single digits. ResMed has never really excited that. As you saw over the last fiscal year or two, rest of the world market, we're driving digital market; country-by-country we've seen some great growth within those countries. So, what happened in France and Japan, we hope to happen to the other 120 countries we are working and where we get a chance to upgrade platforms towards a digital health side because it's a real step change for the industry. But no that mid to high single-digit global growth we expect to continue for the future and for ResMed to not just accept that, but to drive ahead of it. Brett was just explaining the investments in Verily. Well, that's about finding ways to identifying guidance people to bend that growth curve to a higher and higher grade, and we've got multiple investments, Sleep School Labs, Verily, and a number of other partnerships with payers, providers, even governments to drive that forward. So, Margaret in the global growth is in that mid to high-single-digits, but our goal just within sleep is to drive ahead of that. As we add on digital health and COPD and then you add on the Software-as-service-Side, can ResMed drive well above that market growth, absolutely, we have proven that over the last five years and we'll plan to do that as we go towards our 2025 strategy that I outlined in the prep remarks.
Operator: Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Lyanne Harrison: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to understand a little bit about just Software-as-a-Service business and I know you mentioned there was something like 60% growth overall business. Can you sort of shed some color on the underlying Brightree growth? And what are your expectations going forward into subsequent quarters?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks. That's a good question. Yes, clearly, the 63% growth for the quarter included organic and inorganic growth in those businesses. And we are now moving towards the point where Software-as-a-Service has become big enough to become a segment that we're going to talk about going forward. So, I'm happy to talk about it in a little more detail. So, yes, 63% growth for the quarter, including Brightree along with HEALTHCAREfirst, MatrixCare, and Apacheta. So, very solid growth. Within each of those businesses, they had different organic growth profiles. Without going into very, very low levels of detail, the Brightree core business grew in that sort of mid to high single-digits area and obviously with the Brightree management team. We had a Board meeting earlier, this week and we are looking throughout the next four, six, eight quarters and they have a very strong path way back to double-digit growth of their business, leveraging the Apacheta technology, but also some really innovative solutions. They have a new apps for patients that they lines around the conference call with MedTrade and some of these improvements lead to incredible benefit for our home medical equipment customers and therefore allow Brightree to grow not only their share, but their share of accounts within that share. So, I see really a good profile of double-digit growth across our Software-as-a-Service platform on an organic basis as we look forward over the coming fiscal years. 
Operator: Your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks and good evening and good afternoon everyone. May be just staying on Software-as-a-Service, couple of questions there and then just one on France and Japan. So, on Software-as-a-Service, I guess, is there any way to actually give the kind of contribution on the MatrixCare and Apacheta in the quarter? But more importantly as we look into 2019, the remainder of the year, obviously that 63% overall versus mid-single-digit for core Brightree is notable. So, can you give maybe a little bit more color on how to layer those two in as we progress through fiscal 2019? And then I have a follow-up.
Michael Farrell: Yes. Sure. Yes, clearly, that 63% number is inorganic and organic. Anthony, we don't give detailed guidance across our home businesses. So, therefore, we are not going to give detailed guidance within that sector. But as you're thinking sort of across and modeling out that portfolio, it's going to be solid double-digit growth in that Software-as-a-Service entity throughout the coming four quarters. And then as you get to an organic basis and you look at just very solid double-digit and very high margin growth from new additions like MatrixCare, I think you can model out a very strong growth of that whole portfolio. And our goal is actually not just to have these businesses managed as they are, which are great separate entities growing well organically. But some of the best benefits are going to come from interoperability of people moving from care setting to care setting and that we'll be able to get benefit from customers who have people who are in the skilled nursing facilities then move to home health and hospice and back and forth. And so we don't expect to just have these entities manage good individual double-digit growth, high-margin growth businesses, but something that ResMed managing now is strategic, the biggest portfolio of out-of-hospital software that we will be able to grow across that portfolio. We've got really strong plans as I outlined towards our 2025 strategy to be the global leader in there.
Operator: Your next question is from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu: Thanks very much. So just a question on the R&D spend. I was wondering if you can split out how much of that is for data and improving that cloud connected offering. And if you expect it, like, you have given slightly higher guidance going forward than previously, is that because of the data spend?
Michael Farrell: Brett, do you want to have a first go at that and I can cover up on maybe some of our -- the strategically where we're investing in those funds?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure. Yes, so, I mean, we wouldn't flag it across the whole portfolio, Gretel, but we, obviously, we've been in quite a bit in the SaaS area as well and R&D there. And if you look at the guidance where I push that R&D as a percentage of revenue, it's going up a little bit. That really reflects the acquisition and reflects really the percentage of revenue. Typically the SaaS businesses would spend more on R&D as a percentage of revenue. So, I did that to take the guidance to reflect that.
Operator: Your next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joanne Wuensch: Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. When you say that Japan and France is going to continue to be a headwind for the next couple of quarters and then the segment will return to market growth, what's market growth?
Michael Farrell: So, Joanne, market growth is mid to high single-digits, right, for the global sleep apnea business and so we don't split that out country-by-country, but we do sort of talk about the devices side towards the mid-single-digits part and the masks side as towards that high single-digit part. And that's market growth, if you just wait for these patients to show up at a doctor's clinic or a sleep lab. As you know, Joanne, you've been following us for a number of years; we're investing very heavily in geographies for identification, engagement, and enrollment. Not just through our new partnerships, but through our awareness programs and driving patients in. And so we plan to beat that in every country we're in, but market growth is in that mid to high single-digits if you just wait for the patients to show up.
Operator: Your next question is from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Your line is open.
John Deakin-Bell: Good morning. My question is just on the U.S. mask growth, plus 11% is quite a strong quarter. You didn't talk about the -- on a ReSupply contract that you put in place, which we spoke about last quarter. Can you just give us an update on whether there's been an expansion of that in the last quarter? Or whether it's really just on a mask launches that have given such a strong U.S. mask growth?
Michael Farrell: Yes, look, it really was great growth across U.S., Canada, and Latin America. I'll hand Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep business. Do you want to talk about mask growth in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America?
Jim Hollingshead: John thanks for the question. Mask growth, I think, is driven by a couple of things. One is the new product launches are very strong, doing very well everywhere we launch them. And we're getting great feedback both from our HME and healthcare provider customers globally, and also from patients. So, the new launch is doing very well. And then ReSupply continued at a very healthy clip. We don't break up those numbers and we don't talk about specific ReSupply contracts, for example, but we're happy both in new product and in ongoing ReSupply.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just, obviously, post-quarter you've launched Mobi. Just trying to understand the go-to-market strategy, you say we earned the pilot that you were looking at warranty and finance options?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Andrew. So, look, we launched Mobi, a full product launch, really excited about the business. Rob, do you want to talk a little about -- Rob, our COO.
Rob Douglas: Yes. So, Andrew, we ran the controlled product launch for a fair bit at the back end of last year. January 8, we announced a full market launch. So, it's early days in terms of the full market launch. Our go-to-market strategy, as we said, we think the best way to go to market is utilizing the capabilities of our existing partners, the home medical equipment providers in the industry. They're the ones with the close contacts with the patients and access. And we continue to work closely with those players in the market and we think that, as we said, will be an excellent approach. We're actually not copying anyone else's strategy to market. We do have ideas around the challenges around reimbursement and the challenges around funding these products there. But we probably wouldn't put them out on the call. That will be developed and build through the relationships that we have in the market. But in summary, we're very happy with the early days and we're happy with the product performance as well.
Operator: Your next question is from Craig Wong-Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Craig Wong-Pan: Hi there. My question is on rest of the world mask. I was wondering, have the new mask that you released last year, so it's not the AirFit N30i, have those masks released last year been launched in all your rest of the world market or is there still markets to release those mask in?
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. And yes, every geography is different in the speed and rate at which the product is approved and released passed on to distributors, presented to patients, doctors, and the whole ecosystem. And so in the U.S., it tends to be a little faster. So, we literally just launched a product, I think you're talking about the N30i. That press release went out this week. So, we just launched that within the U.S. And so that has had zero traction in the other countries around the world. It's just out. And so we'll start to see that pick up over time in terms of a material impact on ResMed over the coming quarters. But you'd expect to see, in the U.S., some early payers on that. I think when you said existing mask; maybe you're referring to the N20 and F20 masks that I also talked about in my prep remarks. Yes, they are available globally and have had traction. And they led to -- contributed to that 10% global growth within the masks category that we saw on a constant currency basis. It was 11% within U.S., Canada, and Latin America. It was also a very strong 8% within the other markets, but you don't have every country in the world at full speed on the N20, the F20, and the F30 as yet. They launched and they're driving up in those markets, but it's progressing at scale as they get introduced to distributors, to doctors and to the market. So, look, the way I'd summarize it there, Craig, is that there's a long runway ahead for our growth in markets outside the U.S., Canada, and Latin America and also along growth within those geographies for different reasons and a different, sort of, flap speeds.
Operator: Your next question is from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chris Cooper: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can I just come back to Brightree, please? So, if I understood you correctly, last quarter you'd launched a set of new modules and functionality and you had expected Brightree to pick up in the second quarter. But if anything, it does sound like you've kind of slowed sequentially down to, sort of, this mid to high-single-digit level that you talked about. So, not really clear from your comments today what's been developed proprietary on an organic basis in the way that you talked last quarter. Can you just help us understand that?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Chris. And so what we expected last quarter -- so you show modules, so I think during the last quarter we were at MedTrade and so we were showing models to people. They get experience with them. They've got to be adopted by the respiratory therapist. They've got to be adopted by the doctors. If it's on the GoScript side, they've got to be adopted by patients for this new app that we have for patients. And so it's not an immediate effect. And so if you introduce a product this quarter, you don't get an immediate bump next quarter. This is a monthly recurring revenue, quarterly recurring revenue business. So, it's -- once you have a customer, it's very easy to keep them. Once you have a new product, you've got to take time to get customers to adopt it. And so there's an adoption cycle there. So, what I said earlier in the prep remarks and in previous questions is that, I think, to get from that, sort of, single-digits back to strong double-digit growth within Core Brightree business is something that the team has a plan. And they're going to execute to it and I have a strong confidence in it. I'm not saying March 31st is the day that'll happen, but December 31st, absolutely, we'll start to see those products be adopted and put through there. So, it's sort of the speed at which these things get adopted in Software-as-a-Service isn't a 90-day cycle. It's more a 180 or 365-day cycle. And then you increase the users, the number of users and you increase the cost per user, and the revenue comes along with that. But it all comes with the value of those products. And the reason it's a long sales cycle is you've got to get the solution in there. You've got to prove the value to customers and then they have to increase the number of users and grow their share. So, it's maybe a longer cycle than if you thought we were talking about a 90-day turn for a new product. It's more on the 180, 360-day term.
Operator: Your next question is from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, quickly, let me ask a very high-level question. The math indicates over the last three years -- three-plus years, you'll have spent close to $2 billion. And that is approximately give or take $250 million in topline numbers that have been added on. I know some haven't been disclosed, but that's essentially what the rough math has indicated. I guess, my question is the impact on growth -- the impact on gross margins, we can decipher that. How do you look on your acquisition strategy? When does the law of diminishing return set in? And what metrics are you using internally to say, you know what we have packed on enough, I think, so we need to digest it. If you could give us a sense of that that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my question.
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the questions, Suraj. Yes, clearly, we've invested, including Brightree and MatrixCare line, $1.5 billion of investment into our Software-as-a-Service vertical and we're actually really excited about that. The acquisition is driven by three things. Number one is our strategy to be the world leader in digital health in sleep apnea and in digital health for COPD and in out-of-hospital software, and to be the best at all those. As I said actually at JPMorgan earlier this month and have continued to talk about, as we launch our 2025 strategy, I think we've assembled a very strong portfolio of out-of-hospital software assets. And so we do plan to drive more integration, leverage, and interoperability to provide great value to customers in that out-of-hospital space to grow that business. So, we're really excited about the growth of that business. What you didn't mention is the Propeller investment, which actually isn't in that software side, but it's in the digital health of COPD side. If you're the CEO of hospital or you are the Health Minister looking at your top five diseases, COPD is number one, two or three in the chronic diseases you need to address. And so I think that is a strategic investment that Propeller is not providing immediate revenue right there, working on their revenue models with the pharmaceutical companies and establishing what those are in terms of driving adherence to those medications. But the outcome that could happen to global healthcare systems and the savings we could have is absolutely dramatic. And so we don't just look at it on a financial basis to say, okay, we invested $1.5 billion, that's enough. We'll get the return on that. We say, have we built the world's best digital health solution for sleep apnea? Yes. Let's keep driving that and keep growing that. Can we build the world's best digital health solution for COPD with Propeller in our core ventilation cloud connected assets? Yes. So, Richie and his team is going to execute on that. And can we, in the Software-as-a-Service side, be able to have the world's -- at least for now, the U.S. is best system, software system for out-of-hospital software care? Yes. And so we're driving growth on that. We are going to get a strong financial return from those. And I think you've seen that over the last three years. With Brightree, we've done well, and we've got a position to grow that Core growth back. We're going to even add on to that with MatrixCare and with Propeller and with Apacheta.
Operator: Your next question is from David Low with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much. Just, look, my question is really along the same lines, but could you talk a little bit about what Apacheta is? And then sort of a bigger picture perspective, do you have plans to -- for further acquisitions or are you really in a digestion stage now? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: So, I'll hand to Rob to talk about the functionality of Apacheta within -- and how it drives Core Brightree growth. And then, Brett, you can maybe answer the other part of David's question.
Rob Douglas: Well, so, just a bit of background. Apacheta has been a long-time partner of Brightree and they had been working closely together. And they had a really good solution, really supporting the logistics of the HME customers and how they manage deliveries and getting our people into the right environment in the home, and just that part of the HME business has a real support. And so that becomes a very good module of Brightree. And we felt that having Brightree being able to control the development agenda in that business, the R&D agenda in it and integrating it better with the other Brightree modules, we could incrementally add value to the whole Brightree offering. So, that's an exciting add-on module, if you like, for Brightree. Brett, in terms of scope and the size of it?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I mean, it's a kind of a classic within the SaaS business on that stage. So, it's pretty deminimus at the moment, but I think the real attraction for us is the capability enhancement for the Brightree offerings and really being able to run that kind of capability, let's call it module, through Brightree's potential customer base and existing customer base. So, I think from those classic assets, it's worth much more in our hands rather than standalone. So, we think, yes, a really good type of technology capability acquisition for us. But in terms of revenue profit, it'd be pretty deminimus at the moment.
Operator: Our last question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. With the new U.S. bid rates in place, I don't know, Mick, if you can give us a bit of color around pricing in the market and where you think ultimately Fed rates will go with the new rules in place? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question Sean. And yes, the new U.S. bid rates in there and they actually had a Consumer Price Index increase, the couple of percentage points for our customers, which is really good relief for our U.S. customers after a number of years of different interactions with CMS. Look, the pricing environment is incredibly steady. It's in a very steady and stable environment. We are working with our large, small, regional, and mom-and-pop customers. Having solutions like Brightree and working with our customers on scalable solutions to contact their patients, to deliver to their patients, and to manage their businesses, I think we've been able to, as an industry, take a lot of cost out of the delivery of sleep apnea and COPD therapy within U.S. geography. And therefore, we've been able to have a much steadier pricing environment this last year or two than the year or two maybe before that. And as we look forward, we expect that to continue or even get slightly better with, for the first time, in a decade, really, price increases for consumer price index within the CMS space.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark, so I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, Chris and thanks to our global team, 6,500 ResMedians, who sometimes listen to this call as well as our investors.

Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Chris said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the press release and our updated Investor Presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website. I'd like to highlight that we have made a few enhancements to our press release this quarter. We've summarized key information to make it easier to locate and analyze.

Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today, as we review results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. So, first, the top level financial results, we started the new fiscal year right where we left off the old one with another quarter of strong and balanced performance across our portfolio. My personal thanks go out to our global team. It is the hard work and dedication of more than 6,000 ResMedians that has allowed us to continue to deliver these strong results. Global revenue grew by double digits, 12% headline and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our ongoing focus on business efficiencies as well as tech investments has resulted in continued bottom line improvements, with non-GAAP net income improving 23% year-over-year. These efforts at the top line and the bottom line resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.81. So that is 23% growth in Q1 EPS versus this time last year. So now some business highlights across our global fleet and our global respiratory care business. So, turning to a discussion about business operations, let's start with these core businesses. We are the world's leading connected health and digital health technology company with well over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 6 million patients with 100% cloud connectable devices that are available for remote daily monitoring. Over the past 12 months, we have improved their lives by delivering physical products to over 14 million people, delivering products to treat their sleep apnea and/or their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Our digital health technology is turning big data into actionable insights for patients, physicians, homecare providers and beyond. We now have over 3 billion nights of medical sleep and medical COPD data in the cloud and the growth is exponential. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide, who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the over 400 million people worldwide, who suffer from lung disease. As we seek to treat their chronic diseases and help them, really importantly stay out of hospital, with a high quality of life in their own home. Our efforts to improve market access by communicating the clinical and economic efficacy of our solutions with payors, payor providers and governments are achieving results in geographies around the world. There have been significant changes over the past 12 to 18 months in digital health reimbursement in the United States, in France, and in Japan. This is not random and this is just the beginning. Based on the smaller, quieter and more comfortable technology, within our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms and the digital health and connected health solutions of our cloud based Air Solutions platform, we continue to take share with device sales that remain very strong. Last quarter, we discussed the proposed rule issued by CMS regarding changes to logistics and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program in the U.S. We expect the final rule to come out sometime in early to mid-November. Based on our assessment of what is happening in Washington D.C., our key takeaway points remain the same. One, we believe the changes overall will be a net positive for patients, the home care provider industry, and for ResMed. And two, we are pleased that CMS is sincerely listening to industry advocates and seems to be responding to our concerns and the concerns that we have for patients and the community. On the devices side of our business, we delivered another solid quarter with year over year global constant currency growth of 14% powered by strong growth of 20% in Europe, Asia and the rest of world, and solid 9% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies. During August, we introduced an upgrade to our Astral life support ventilator platform and have seen good adoption since the launch of that Astral platform. This is now added and compounded to the digital health powered growth of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices. The controlled product launch of our Mobi portable oxygen concentrator is going very well and we expect to move to a full product launch next quarter as we lock down our go to market model. We are working in full partnership with our HME customers to grow this category. We think that's the best strategy and the one that helps not only home care providers but most importantly the patients. We continue to build device – our market share as healthcare providers and physicians around the world are choosing ResMed devices not just for their intrinsic designed in quality but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions we offer as part of our ecosystem. These solutions are literally upgraded every few weeks as new versions of AirView, myAir, the Brightree platform and HEALTHCAREfirst cloud-based software are released. We will continue to evolve and enhance our solutions to meet ongoing patient, physician, payor, and home care provider needs. We believe this will continue to drive future ResMed success. The masks and accessories side of our business grew 10% in constant currency globally during the quarter, led by a very strong demand in the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies which grew at 11% on a constant currency basis. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 on the full face side and our AirFit N20 on the nasal side across all geographies. During the quarter, we launched our brand new AirFit F30, an amazing innovation in the minimal-contact full face mask category. It's our first play in this category of product. With the F30, we have expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options for home care providers and ultimately for the very needs of individual patients. By keeping our innovation laser-focused on under-met and unmet customer needs, we will achieve continued growth of ResMed masks throughout fiscal year 2019 and beyond. So, let's now turn to a discussion of our Software as a Service global business. This business continues its trajectory of growth with revenue up 25% year-on-year driven by continued expansion of Brightree, but also incremental contribution from the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, which closed early in Q1. We are revolutionizing healthcare delivery through a smart connected ecosystem that provides superior outcomes for patients and for homecare providers. We have been working on some pretty important enhancements of our out-of-hospital medical software business over the last few years. Let me cover some recent highlights in the last few quarters. We recently commenced a controlled launch of our Brightree Advanced Analytics platform. This data analytics platform leverages advanced analytics technology and filtering capabilities to offer a scalable data solution for homecare providers. We help customers better manage their business from an aggregate perspective and also provide the ability to easily drill down into the details to drive business efficiency. Ultimately, this will free up cash flow and clinician time, which will lead to better patient care. We also recently introduced two new apps for customers. First, the BrightreeCARE app for home health and hospice aides, as well as the Patient Hub app, which is designed for home medical equipment providers. The BrightreeCARE app enables home health and hospice aides to easily document their visits in the home on their own smart device without having to carry additional equipment. This provides mobility, flexibility and efficiency to our customers. We think it's going to help drive home health and hospice market share growth for our Brightree franchise. Patient Hub is a patient engagement app that automates and simplifies how HME providers connect with their patients into one secure platform. This effectively eliminates the need for multiple Web portals and sign-ons and consolidates all patient interactions including appointment reminders, insurance updates, order placement, and delivery status. By improving ease of engagement and automation, the Patient Hub app empowers care providers, frees up resources and creates opportunities to accelerate cash flow for our HME customers. We will continue to invest in these and other technologies to expand our Software-as-a Service portfolio offering. There will be strong ongoing organic growth as well as opportunities for acquisition-driven growth within the United States and also certain geographies that we're looking at in Europe and in Asia. Now let's discuss the progress we have made executing on our global business excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered yet another quarter of double-digit net operating profit improvement. That's the fifth quarter in a row. We are pleased to again drive operating leverage to improve the bottom line of our business. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 26% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable gross margin with disciplined investment in SG&A, which grew by just 4% in constant currency in the quarter and research and development investments, which grew at 8% in constant currency during the quarter. I want to reemphasize that our business excellence initiatives are about the long term, working more efficiently, leveraging new tech tools, improving global processes, and working smarter. We are taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach and we will continue to invest in R&D for our business and deliver strong organic growth and operating leverage. We have proven that these two value growth engines, organic growth and operating leverage, are not mutually exclusive. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well-positioned to grow throughout FY 2019 and beyond. The continued success of our current mask and device portfolio along with the solid pipeline of new products and enhanced connected health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum as we move throughout the year. We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top- and bottom-line growth into 2020 and beyond as we execute on our strategy to continue to lead the med tech field in digital health to create value with connected health and to achieve what we call our Triple Aim, which is: one, to slow chronic disease progression; two, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and three, most importantly to improve the outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer in our industry, our patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks. And then, we will go to Q&A. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $588.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 13%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $326.4 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $214.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $172.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $154 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $151.7 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 20%. Masks and other sales were $62.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 14%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $47.5 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter. This includes the contribution from our HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition that closed on July 6. Excluding HEALTHCAREfirst, Software-as-a-Service revenue grew in the high single digits. As you heard from Mick earlier, we've recently introduced several new SaaS offerings and expect future growth opportunities over the coming quarters and fiscal years based on our expanded platforms and our ongoing innovations. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.3% compared with 58.4% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. On a sequential basis, our gross margin improved by 20 basis points over Q4 FY 2018. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2019 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25% compared to the 27.5% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter was $38.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis an increase of 8%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% as compared with 7.1% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. Amortization of the acquired intangibles was $12.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter; while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $116.3 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.81, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the September quarter was 23.9%; while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%. We continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $48.1 million. This included tax payments of $125 million in the current quarter, compared to $30.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Excluding the tax payments, our cash flow from operations was $173.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $30.4 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, and we continued our share buyback during the September quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $22.8 million. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, for cash consideration of $126.3 million. With respect to our recently announced joint venture with Verily, we have now received all required regulatory approvals and expect to commence operations during our second quarter. We will provide an update of the likely operating costs associated with the JV in our second quarter earnings call. At September 30, we have $530 million in gross debt and $299 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $1.9 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thanks, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to hop back into the queue. Chris, we're now ready to go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs is online with a question.
Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. I'll state my one question. Just on European masks please, I think the 6% number that we saw was just a little bit larger than we've seen lately, and I appreciate you have potentially a pretty strong comp. I'll be just curious to hear if you could talk to some of the drivers around what's driven that number and specifically as well, I'll be curious to hear if you could comment on what sort of impact you've seen in terms of share from your competitors' full face mask that was launched, I guess, back in April now. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. And yeah, we're really quite proud of the global and constant currency growth, the 10% on masks, 11% in U.S. and Canada, 6% in Europe, Asia and others is maybe just around sort of the market growth range. I think our comp was around the sort of 10%, 15% from a year ago quarter. And so as you noted there was a very, very strong comp there. Look, we've just launched new masks into this marketplace. The QuietAir technology was launched just maybe six plus months ago. The F30 is only just hitting global markets at this point. And so, Europe tends to take longer for technologies to permeate through the different countries and each different countries have different reimbursement models. It's not the United States of Europe. So, we have to work through sort of the 26 models of reimbursement and how masks are provided there. I do think there's opportunity to drive more resupply of masks throughout many of our European countries, and so there's systemic and digital health driven methodologies that we can use to drive the whole market number up there. But if you're asking if I'd like to see 6% be closer to 10%, the answer is absolutely. Do I think it's a good quarter from our European team with 20% growth on devices and 6% growth on masks? Absolutely. But I know there's room for improvement there, and we'll certainly be working with Tim Hoyes and (00:26:04) the global team and the Western European, Northern European and Eastern European leaders to make sure that we can move that number up as we move forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond. (00:26:17)
Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: ...just to clarify, I mean, it's more of a – the fact that the market growth exceeds beyond that level, you're not seeing yourself lose any momentum to your new competitors?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we're losing share in the European marketplace. I think there's opportunities to grow that market growth number, but I don't think we're losing share at that point, but I think we should be taking share with the F30 and the QuietAir technology. And so I'd like to see that number push closer to the double digits, Chris.
Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Wong Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi. Just wanted to ask about your rest of world device growth, I mean, that was quite strong. Could you just talk to what are the main drivers behind that?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Craig, good question. So that's the 20% Europe, Asia and other markets growth. Yeah, incredibly strong. We did see continued benefits in countries like France as we see the digital health technology and reimbursement changes that have happened there and there's a good strong tail to that upgrade, if you like, from non-cloud connectable to cloud connectable devices across France. But I'm going to tell you across the other 25 countries in Europe and across many of the countries in Asia, we saw just a really strong quarter in our device business. It's powered by the digital health technology. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, you've seen actual reimbursement changes in the U.S. and in France and in Japan and certainly they're providing some power behind the growth, but in many other countries where reimbursement hasn't yet caught up to the technology, the technology itself is lowering the setup cost of our therapy by 50% and improving the adherence rate from industry standard, 50%, 60% like pharmaceutical medicines up to 80%, 87% in some of the published data that we have out there. So that's the real power behind it, and we think there's a lot of legs to it. Certainly, some elements like the upgrade from non-cloud connectable to connectable has a time limit to it, but the digital health tail of lowering costs and improving adherence, which improves outcomes, we think has a much longer runway, and so we're excited about that opportunity to continue our Europe, Asia and global growth in devices.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Sorry, can I just clarify on France, I thought last quarter you were mentioning that that sort of benefit from digital health devices was easing off, but it sounds like that's kind of ramped up again, would that be correct?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, it hasn't ramped up again. It just hasn't eased off as quickly and you know I think that – as I said I think that tail is longer than we had thought 90 days ago and probably has a little bit more to run in it and – but it's not just that one country, right, there's 199 others outside of the U.S. and France that we sell into. And I think the point I'm trying to make is it's – many of the others starting to power up around digital health not just on reimbursement driven ones like that country like France, but on the – just the core economic and efficacy value prop that we get from the digital health technology that we have now in the AirSense 10 and on the AirCurve 10 and in some of the ventilation platforms as well.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Great. Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Securities. Your line is open.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. With – related to Brightree, the high-single-digits organic growth rate, it's kind of a slowdown from what you guys were reporting in fiscal 2018? Is that kind of a one quarter blip or is the high-single-digit growth rate kind of a go-forward rate?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Matt, and that's a really good question. As you noted, yeah, high-single-digits from Brightree but 25% from Brightree plus HEALTHCAREfirst and the other SaaS platforms. Look, it's the first quarter that we were integrating HEALTHCAREfirst. And so we have a team in home health and hospice at Brightree working on integration of those two platforms and in the core HME platform at Brightree. Our team was just at Medtrade this quarter and they've launched, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, brand new apps and some other value props that I think can help add not only more users, but more value per user opportunities as we go throughout fiscal 2019. So do I think that high-single-digits can go back to low-double-digits on the core Brightree? Absolutely. And there's probably three reasons for that. One, as I talked about in competitive bidding we're seeing that landscape really settle out so that people can focus on efficiency versus sort of some of the other aspects of declining reimbursement over the last seven years. Two, with all the changes over the last seven years in the HME industry, there's just a need for more and more efficiencies. And three, as I mentioned, some of these new solutions we're bringing into play. So, for those three reasons, I'm very confident that we can start to get that double-digit growth out of the core Brightree platform, while also integrating HEALTHCAREfirst and tying our home health and hospice value props together as we grow in the HME industry.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you for the color.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Mick, you mentioned that the Mobi will go into a full product release this quarter. I don't know if you're able to give us some flavor or detail around what your strategy is there and maybe some feedback from the customer base to see what they want to see from such a product.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Sean, just to clarify, I said next quarter. So, we're going to go to full product launch during our Q3, which is our January to March quarter.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Got it.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: But Rob Douglas is here. Rob, do you want to give a little more clarity on to Mobi and our go-to-market model?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Sean. We've been experimenting with our controlled product launch throughout the year. It's been slow and steady progress. The customers using it and we've selected them carefully, really liked the product and it's working well. We're seeing really good field performance from it, and we're very happy with it. Mick and I both have been in the factory in Singapore seeing it being built, and we're very, very proud of the systems that we've got there and we think we've got an extremely high quality product. As we've said many times, our go-to-market strategy really involves supporting our HME provider customers to access patients and to get this treatment on the patients in the most effective way and those are really the things we've been looking at closely in the preps for the full launch. And as Mick said, we're well on hand with preparations for full launch starting in the next quarter, in Q3.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Right. Thanks, Rob. And maybe just a quick one for Brett, just to check looking at the balance sheet that stepped down in tax payable, so the issue on cash flow from ops is now in the rear vision mirror, is that correct?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that paid the payable on the balance sheet, we essentially paid that or a lot of that through this quarter, Sean. You saw that come through the cash flow.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks, Brett, and that's all I have.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Okay.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you, Mick.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The one thing that we're happened to notice since the last few years, your increase in SG&A as a percentage of total sales the fourth quarter relative to the fourth tends to go up, and this is kind of relatively flat, maybe down a little bit. So, can you walk us through any potential changes this quarter outside of ResMed 3.0? And then as we look forward is 4% growth in dollars currency neutral the right number, or will that change given the recent top-line growth that you've seen of 13%?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the business excellence and the operating excellence programs that we've been putting into place. And clearly, yeah, as you saw in Q1 with the 4% growth in SG&A year-on-year, we really are focused on making sure we don't just work harder, but we work smarter and we have better global processes. We take some of the amazing sort of tech-driven healthcare and tech-driven solutions that we've given to our customers and apply them internally. And so we're looking at tech-driven solutions in systems and softwares within our company to allow us to throw process and technology at a problem not just say we need to hire 20 more people to solve that problem. And so I think our team has got very sophisticated on this and we had some great results. As you know, we don't give detailed quarter-to-quarter guidance on exactly what we're going to do in terms of year-on-year growth. But we're going to keep that SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the bounds that Brett said in his prepared remarks. And I'd love to do better than that, but that's the sort of guidance that we're going to give and stick to. What we saw in this quarter was excellent performance from our team. We've got 6,000 people selling in 120 countries and selling a lot more and selling a lot smarter, and I love the results and we want to do more of the above.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just as a quick follow-up to one your other comments, Mick, you had mentioned M&A within the SaaS ex-U.S. and Europe and Asia is kind of geographic targets perhaps. So maybe you can describe kind of what attributes you guys are looking for and should we assume that those targets are going to be focused on your largest geographies or maybe smaller that are good fits that you can expand into other geographies? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Margaret, that's a good follow-up. It allows us to talk about the M&A strategy in that global SaaS business. So you know as you heard, Margaret, and many others on our Investor Day where we had a drill-down from Raj Sodhi, who's the global President of our SaaS business. He's the global President of our SaaS business and a lot of the focus has been on Brightree, which is U.S. focused and HEALTHCAREfirst, which is U.S. focused. We do sell in 120 other countries and we're clearly looking for opportunities outside there. I'm not going to signal because it's a competitive market exactly what geographies and what sectors we're looking at outside. I do just want to let our investor base know that we are looking at that opportunity. And we are also looking within the United States. Look, as you saw in the quarter incredible organic growth, right. I mean, 25% across just Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst and all the tuck-ins we've put in there, we think that opportunity is there within the U.S.; and for ResMed, we think we have the right to be the world's leading provider of out-of-hospital medical software. We've done it in HME. We're doing it really well in home health and hospice verticals, and there are other verticals in the out-of-hospital care sector that we think can help within the U.S. geography and beyond. So, Margaret, without getting really specific, that's what I was talking to, and as we look at M&A, it's got to meet three criteria: Number one, it's got to fit our global strategy; two, it's got to make sense on the numbers and fit our financial strategy; and three, it's got to be a strong cultural fit. It has to be a fit between us and the management team and that we're going to work together and work better together and provide some growth to each other and sharing across the platform. So that's how we look at M&A. Thanks for the questions, Margaret.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Lyanne, if you're speaking, you're on mute. Okay, Chris. Let's go to the next question.
Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hello. (00:38:52)
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Oh, no, here's Lyanne.
Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I'm just – I have a question around your operating leverage and with your gross margins for this quarter. Can you shed some light in terms of what sort of operating leverage mechanisms were in place to help counter your ASP reductions?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I'll hand that – it's a good question, Lyanne. I'll hand that question to Brett Sandercock, our CFO.
Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Lyanne. We've got, I mean it's probably where – we've got quite a large program in place, I guess, which is kind of cost out programs or initiatives around efficiencies and improvements in processes, improvements in procurement or logistics, which basically we look at, I mean, we look at it well over time, but on a monthly basis and pretty formalized in terms of making sure we have a good pipeline of opportunities that we've always got. And then, looking and seeing and make sure that we're executing on those pipeline of opportunities as well. So quite sophisticated in what we do to make sure that we can operate it efficiently as we can. And clearly, if we can do that, that supports the gross margin and offsets as you can see this quarter, essentially offsets some typical ASP decline. So, that can be around a lot, I mean it can be around improvements to production, routing and selling that would improve, for example, recoveries that we make on the back of growing volumes or it could be around procurement and working even more closely nowadays with suppliers to make sure we can get the products not just as cheaply as we can but kind of as smart as we can in terms of the components and kind of what they can offer us and we try to build that into our prices as well. The kind of, I guess, quite – it gets more sophisticated in terms of how you're partnering and that's tended to help us in driving out some cost as well and there's no silver bullet. It's a number of programs and a number of opportunities that we have to work on essentially day in and day out. But, I guess, it's almost part of our DNA to make sure we could deliver on those and that's – and we don't hold back. There's not an endpoint, it's just an ongoing process. And so that's basically what the team works on particularly on the operations side.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Brett, also just to add in there Lyanne, we're running really an innovation-driven growth company and we're investing to grow the company, but we've got a really solid base of a lot of existing patients and existing business. So, a lot of our sort of leverage strategies around improving efficiencies in those core parts of the business, enabling the investments in innovation to really start driving new and more efficient ways to go to market, and then that feeds on itself going that way. But we're really getting leverage by investing appropriately in the growth areas and getting more efficient in the existing areas.
Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just to follow-up on that, you mentioned there was an improvement in logistics costs as well. Have you seen your logistic costs increase with the rising fuel cost?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well I mean I think that might start to manifest, but it's not – I don't – it will be a cost impact for us but I don't think it would be significant for us. I mean, it's certainly there. I don't want to discount it completely but it's not – it wouldn't be like a huge component of costs for us.
Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on U.S. masks, the 11% was a good number on – a very good number actually on tough comps. Just trying to get a sense whether you're seeing the acceleration of your resupply growth in that number?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question Andrew. I mean certainly, we have seen some good success of the QuietAir technology that has been in there now two and a half quarters and then the brand new launch of the F30 out the gate may have had some impact, but Jim Hollingshead who is the President of our Global Sleep Business might have some commentary as to the resupply.
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Andrew. There are a couple of things going on in the North America market. The first one is, the mask portfolio, our product mix is performing very well. So the F20 is performing very well, the N20 is performing very well and so our position with new patients is very strong. But resupply is also doing well and what we've seen over the last several quarters is an increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms by HMEs in the market. And so I think we're getting growth on both sides of it, both new patient and resupply.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: That's terrific. And just picking up on that question on ASP, I'm guessing that with your GM being flat it's primarily driven by devices up 14%, masks up 10%. Just trying to think, going forward, whether that maybe brings about any change in your GMs for your devices?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, look certainly the portable oxygen concentrator market is closer to the gross margin profile of the CPAP range versus that you'd find in a full face mask or a Software as a Service solution and so yeah, we think it's fantastic gross profit dollar contribution that we can achieve from the portable oxygen concentrator market that it will be in a lower gross margin percentage dollar. We still think it's a great market to go after because of the 400 million patients worldwide, who suffer from lung disease, how they want to get out of their home and be untethered from that liquid oxygen, POCs provide a great opportunity and ResMed with our experience in digital health and what we can do when we not only give great quality oxygen and portability and reliability in the Mobi, but then also in the future bring our digital health capabilities to bear, we think it's a great market to go after. So, yeah, you'll see both of those, growth in gross profit dollars, some impact on the gross margin percentage, but certainly ResMed investing in a strong strategic area, in a chronic disease that needs our help and we can help keep these patients out of hospital and happily in their home or in the park playing with their grandkids with lung disease and our ResMed Mobi.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Great. So, it's a more absolute growth as opposed to sort of margin leverage through that I guess, through that change in mix.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks (00:45:49).
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Yeah.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Correct.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. Mick, just picking up on your comment about resupply in markets outside the U.S., so just wondering if you could give us some – any metrics at all in terms of where the bigger European markets are at versus the U.S. so we could perhaps get some sense of the opportunity there?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. Look and I know you've followed our stock for many years and so, it's not new news to you that the resupply rate is stronger in the U.S. than in Western Europe and Asia. One thing we're finding as we now are expanding our digital health capability and empowering patients worldwide, now 6 million to 8million patients worldwide with their digital health data is that when patients get control of their data and get control of their healthcare, they demand more things. And one of the things they demand is a clean mask. And I personally use a device and if you're not changing your mask every three months or worse six months, the thing gets incredibly visually in need of replacement. And I think if you look at the average replacement in the U.S. it's around two masks per year on average in some data that was public on that front. We think it could be more than that. If you empower patients with the ability to access different models to get resupply. We're working on that in Brightree and in ResMed Resupply and Brightree Connect. But we also think for the other 120 countries we do business in, there's an opportunity to empower patients with their data, empower patients with an opportunity to have access to more masks on an annual basis. And I'm looking at Jim Hollingshead here, our President of our Global Sleep Business. I mean, Jim you know resupply outside the U.S. is something we've been looking at for a long period of time. Digital health gives us an opportunity, right?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Digital health certainly drives it and I think patients definitely want clean masks and resupply mask. And by the way, I'll throw – I'll add to that point that recent research shows that when a patient is resupplied, they're more adherent, right. And so, we're seeing more and more evidence for that and I think that that's starting to influence more and more physicians worldwide. But if you think about Europe and resupply, you've got this massive variety of payment models. I mean, we wouldn't have time to go through them all on the call. But what you are seeing is pretty steady resupply in most of those markets. And in some cases patients are getting resupplied because the hospital system has trouble doing it, just has trouble executing on it. And so, you'll – in certain countries, more and more we're providing that kind of service on behalf of the hospital system. I mean, that's a very different model from the U.S. where you've got a fee-for-service resupply that's driving demand. In certain countries in Europe, a hospital system wants to give the patient a mask just administratively can't do it. And so, that's one of the ways we're driving resupply in different European markets.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: But, so it would seem that it would be fair to say that the resupply rates across, let's pick the three or four biggest European markets, are significantly lower than the U.S. perhaps only half?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: They are low. We haven't gone into sort of the quantitative on that. And I don't think there's been any like external research public that I can talk to on that David. But clearly outside the U.S. the resupply rates are lower. The bottom line is patient demand is there. And as Jim said, even sometimes the channel partner and the patient want to deliver, they just don't know how and haven't got the capability to do it. ResMed has the capability to do it and we've proven that in a number of international markets outside the U.S. And what I was talking to on the answer earlier was that we plan to rev up those capabilities and really help our customers, the patients, and the providers provide better care. And as Jim said, that leads to better adherence and lower cost for the healthcare system.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks for that. Could I just squeeze one other in? Brett, we've worried a little bit about legal costs and that having an impact on the operating leverage. I was wondering if you could just talk to what we – what came through in the quarter past and what we should expect for the year ahead. Thanks.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, David, it's been, I guess, our legal cases and so on have been ongoing for a while now. So it's more or less built into the run rate. And, I mean, it can vary around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but I wouldn't expect it – it's sort of built into the run rate, so I wouldn't expect that to significantly spike through the year or anything like that. Leading up to court cases and so on, it can increase a little. But I don't think it would be particularly meaningful in any quarter at least that's what our expectation is at this stage. It's more or less built into the run rate that we've seen over the last year or two.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just in terms of the business acquisition you made in the quarter of $126 million, firstly, I missed the name of it and second, did that lead to any profit contribution for the quarter please? And if so, can you give us some color around that? Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. The acquisition was HEALTHCAREfirst. So, it's a Software as a Service provider for home health, so home nursing and hospice providers within the U.S. geography, a really exciting business that did contribute in the quarter as we talked about to driving the 25% year-on-year growth in our Software as a Service global business. Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to the other parts of David's question as to impact on profitability during the quarter or not going into too much further detail there?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I can. It's a nice acquisition, but it's not a large one as such. So, it's not – we wouldn't get that granular on that Dave, but we did, I think last call or the call before I think we sort of said that the revenue from that was about $28 million or $29 million something like that. So, that will kind of size it for you. Obviously some profit contributions, but on the size of our business, I guess, kind of quarterly fairly de minimis. But from a portfolio standpoint, our SaaS business, quite exciting space and we're seeing good growth opportunities there. So, we do think that's strong, strategically, just a small contribution initially, but we do think that should give us a nice growth trajectory.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Just to add on to that David, the home health and hospice category or vertical if you like that HEALTHCAREfirst sells into, Brightree also sells into that. So, we've got those two teams integrating and working together to drive, as Brett said, good ongoing organic growth as we look forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years within that home health and hospice vertical which we think is underserved, for this great software and there's a lot of opportunity to grow.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Good morning, good afternoon, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just looking at the 14% devices growth, strong growth globally, can you give any color or talk to how the non-invasive ventilation part of your business is going relative to the core sleep, CPAP part of the business?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So as you know we don't break out the particular AirCurve 10 versus the AirSense 10 aspect of that and we don't break out the Astral and we just launched the Mobi. But the vast majority of the sales are in the sleep side of the business as you know that's what the company was founded on, it's our core business. I'm really excited by the new software upgrade to Astral and it's really starting to come out of the gate well. But it's not a strong – wasn't a strong material contributor in the quarter. We do think, as we look forward, that the AirCurve 10 and Astral life support ventilator and the Mobi, those three together in our respiratory care vertical will really start to contribute. And I look forward to the earnings call when I'm breaking them out and going through them in detail because it's material to the global business. But at this point, we don't break them out to that level of detail but I appreciate your question. And yeah, certainly that 14% global number it really – as I said in the prepared remarks, it really talks to the economic value proposition of the digital health. People are choosing our devices and we're taking share even three plus four years out on some of these platforms because the software isn't four years out, it was updated two weeks ago, four weeks ago and it'll be upgraded every month this coming 12 months. So, that's sort of the picture there, Saul, but appreciate your question. Sorry, I can't go into more granular detail for you.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Not after breakout of revenues by device type, but just more interested in whether the growth in the contribution of whatever revenue it was for the non-invasive platform within the space is on par with what you see in sort of the core sleep therapies, is it materially lower, higher just that type of comment.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, no. It's on par and in the future has the potential to be well ahead of given the under-met opportunity particularly in portable oxygen concentrators that are digitally powered and I think in the NIV space. I mean you look at the clinical data that we presented over the last number of quarters showing that we can reduce hospitalizations, reduce costs and really improve the lives of these COPD patients. I think NIV is particularly in the U.S. and non-sort of Western European geographies completely underpenetrated versus its opportunity in the COPD space. So, I think there is an opportunity for it to be materially above, but in Q1, it was pretty much in line with the growth across the other businesses.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks Saul.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks very much. So just in rest of world you've had reimbursement changes in France, Japan, South Korea over the last 12 months. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of discussions for the other reimbursements – like potential reimbursement changes in other rest of world markets, do you anticipate any changes in the next 6 to 12 months?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Gretel. It's a great question. And yeah, certainly we saw the digital health changes for doctors in Japan, we saw the digital health changes for home care providers in France and we saw for the first time in the history of the country actual reimbursement for CPAP as a treatment for sleep apnea in South Korea that we talked about last quarter. So, those are all three really good wins. Our global market access team is incredibly focused on this as we look at the 120 countries we do business in and how to help governments understand that CPAP therapy saves money and improves lives and improves outcomes and quality of lives. And so, we are in all countries – I think if you just take the example of the French reimbursement changes, our French team have been talking for three to five years with the French Ministry for Health (sic) [Ministry for Solidarity and Health] (00:57:41) to show the return on investment of the digital health initiatives. And so, when that reimbursement change came, it wasn't a surprise to us. It was a lot of hard work to get it to that point and change. But predicting when governments will put good policy behind great opportunities to save money and improve the lives of their constituents is a bet that I'm not willing to put out there or predict which country will be next. But I promise, Gretel, that as soon as we see the changes come that we'll report them here on our quarterly call and let you know how it works. Jim, that team works really closely with your global sleep team, any further color on that?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: We talked a little bit about this at Investors Day. I think that the global market access team continues to work on multiple fronts to get payors and government entities to see the positive return on finding and treating the sleep apnea patient. But as Mick said earlier, the digital health platform creates value for care providers with or without reimbursement, right. So, we're seeing the growth of the business and the growth of treatment of patients with the digital care platforms of Air Solutions and the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices because it creates value for the care provider. We're continuing to chase reimbursement wherever we can because we think we have a very strong story to tell about health economics, but the digital care platforms create a lot of value in their own right.
Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks for your time.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, Gretel.
Operator: Our last question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open.
David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Mobi, just wondering if there's anything you can point to in relation to differentiation relative to other products in the market. Can't – I haven't really been able to see much by way of product specifications. But just wondering if there's anything you can talk to in relation to either weight, battery life, et cetera that would set you apart from the other offerings in the POC space?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's a great question David and a really exciting space. Rob, do you want to go into some of the details of how we're going to show value in those specs, but also the go-to-market?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yes, David we haven't really made a lot of publicity to you all around the specs of Mobi, because I actually don't think that's sort of the right way of looking at it. The issue here on these POC devices is really getting the right balance of features that make it the most usable product. So, we've got a really good battery life. We've got a great weight and a really good oxygen output that lets people be mobile and to use a device with confidence. If you just pick one parameter and say it's stronger in this and stronger in that, it's actually not really getting the point of how we think competition should be operating in this market. So, we've got a great product configuration with a really good optimal trade-off. We think it's the optimal trade-off of the specs. And as we said before, we're really pursuing go-to-market strategy with the support and a way for us to support our HME partners really in countries around the world. And so, I know it's still a watch this space program, but we're really taking a disciplined approach to launching the product.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David the only thing I'd add on there is I think partnering with your channel particularly one – we had two decades, three decades of working with our channel in the sleep space to partner with them in the respiratory care space we think is the right strategy. We don't think some of our competitors are competing with the channel in this space and I just don't think it's a smart strategy. I think you want to partner with a channel and really drive value to that end user patient. The ultimate customer here is the patient. We have to find the best way to get them and our channel has such great ability to reach sleep apnea patients and COPD patients in the past. They've often been the ones to provide liquid oxygen. They should be the ones to provide portable oxygen. And so I think the go-to-market strategy will differentiate us more than others. But David, watch this space, we'll talk to you in 90, in 180, in 360 days about how the Mobi rollout goes and I think we'll start to see that really pick up.
David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for your questions, David.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: And so we've now reached the hour mark. And look, before we close the call, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence initiatives. Our team is the core of what we do and it's helped us deliver another quarter of really strong revenue growth and increased operating leverage. We remain focused on our future pipeline of products, services, and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, the patients, physicians, payors, home care providers and governments. Thanks for your time and we look forward to talking to you again in 90 days. Over to you, Amy.
Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thank you again for joining us today. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to contact me directly. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, the webcast replay along with our earnings release and updated Investor Presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.

I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.
Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending June 30, 2018.

I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders that are joining us today, as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. So, first, our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of broad-based strong performance and I'd like to recognize the continued hard work that our 6,000-strong team has put in to achieve these results. Revenue once again grew by double digits, 12% on a headline basis and 10% on a constant currency basis, led by our sleep and respiratory care therapy businesses, performing well across global markets in both devices and masks. We also achieved good continued growth in our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service business. In addition to strong top line growth, our focus on operating leverage has resulted in continued bottom line success, with non-GAAP operating profit improving 19% year-over-year. Our efforts across the board from top line to bottom line performance resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95. So, now some business highlights across our sleep and respiratory care business. Turning to a discussion of our business and its operations, so let's start with this part. We continue to pioneer and lead the industry in connected health and digital health. We now have over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 5 million patients with 100% cloud-connected devices that are available for remote daily monitoring. In addition, over 1 million patients have signed up to access and review their own data with our personal patient engagement app called myAir. Our big data efforts to gather actionable information continued to increase exponentially and we now have over 2.5 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in the cloud. These data support our efforts to analyze information and unlock value for our customers, enabling us to take action to better support home care providers, physicians, payers and ultimately, the most important customer, the patient. We continue our efforts to improve market access by working with payers across many geographies to improve reimbursement. Last quarter, we highlighted the revised reimbursement that went into effect in Japan during April. This resulted in our Japanese customers increasing their adoption of our cloud-connected devices. This increased activity continued in the fourth quarter and we saw another period of very strong sales in Japan. During the quarter, France continued to benefit from telemonitoring reimbursement incentives that went into effect last year. We expect year-over-year growth to return to normal patterns in France throughout fiscal 2019. Further, on the topic of reimbursement changes, our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies; the U.S., France, and Japan, getting beyond these and starting to look a little deeper. South Korea began reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea during July. While the market size in South Korea is not nearly as big as the U.S., France, Japan or Germany, this is a really positive sign that our market access efforts are raising awareness and public health and the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea. Also, in July, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a proposed rule to make changes to the bidding and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program. Here are my two key takeaways: one, overall these changes will be a net positive for patients, for home care providers and for ResMed; and two, it's great that CMS is listening to industry advocates and responding to our concerns that have been impacting patients for many years. On the masks and accessories side of our business, in Q4, we had another very strong quarter, with global constant currency growth of 13% in the category. This was led by continued strong demand in our Europe and Asia markets, which grew a very strong 16% on a constant currency basis in masks and accessories. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 full face mask and our AirFit N20 nasal mask products across all geographies. We're also encouraged by the success of our N20 Classic, which is positioned specifically for countries in Europe and is performing really well in those countries that we targeted. This is the validation of our approach to create unique solutions for specific geographies. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved very solid revenue growth of 12% in masks, driven by a continued success of the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks with patients, physicians and our home care providers. I'm proud of our team taking market share, growing ahead of the market in the U.S., Europe and Asia and globally. On the devices side of our business, we saw solid year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, driven by strong growth in the U.S. of 9% on a year-over-year basis in devices. We continue to grow our device market share as healthcare providers and physicians are choosing and scripting ResMed, respectively, because of our quality, the sustainable value proposition of Air Solutions and the connected health and digital health outputs that come from Air Solutions, AirView, myAir, and the whole portfolio of cloud-based solutions that we have. Let's now turn to a discussion of our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service businesses. This part of our business continues its trajectory of steady growth with revenue up 12% year-over-year. Brightree, which makes up the vast majority of this category, remains the top choice for home medical equipment companies, who use third-party software providers. Brightree's growth and leadership position in the health IT industry was recently recognized by Healthcare Informatics Magazine as a Top 100 Healthcare Information Technology Company for the fifth year in a row. I'm really proud of that part of our global ResMed team. We continue to invest in options for the future and to drive further growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings. On July 9, we closed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, a company offering electronic health record software, billing and coding services, as well as advanced analytics to both home health and hospice agencies. HEALTHCAREfirst enables these providers to optimize their clinical, financial and administrative processes, and we are proud to welcome the talented team from HEALTHCAREfirst to ResMed. Brightree also has home health and hospice and offerings that we think will combine very well with HEALTHCAREfirst. The HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition complements these existing solutions from Brightree and expands our footprint even further into the large and growing home health and hospice segments. These markets will continue to grow swiftly as an aging population shifts the lower cost out-of-hospital healthcare settings. The combination of Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst capabilities will allow us to drive further enhancements and innovation for home health and hospice customers, ultimately increasing the business efficiency of our provider customers and improving outcomes for our patients. Now, let's discuss the progress we have made in executing on our operating excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered on our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit net operating profit improvement, and we're very pleased to once again deliver operating leverage to improve our bottom line. Non-GAAP income from operations improved 19% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable margin with very disciplined growth in SG&A, which grew by just 3% constant currency, and research and development, which grew at 6% constant currency. I want to reemphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long-term. It's about working more efficiently, being focused and working smarter. We're taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach, and we will continue to invest in market-leading innovation across our businesses to continue to deliver strong organic growth. On that front, our product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned last quarter, we have just launched our brand new QuietAir technology that is part of our AirFit F20 full face mask and we're really pleased to see good customer response to this mask during the quarter, which continues to lead in the full face mask category over all our competitors. Last quarter, we also discussed the controlled launch of Mobi, the first ResMed-branded portable oxygen concentrator for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for others who require oxygen therapy. We continue to gain insights and gather data on our go-to-market model for POCs. We are getting ready to scale this business. Tens of millions of COPD patients need our help and we are preparing to do just that. Now, for some business highlights in clinical research. A fundamental element of our mission here at ResMed is not only to deliver life-changing products and connected-health solutions to patients worldwide with sleep apnea, COPD and other severe respiratory and chronic disease conditions but to also spread awareness about these conditions and the availability of good diagnostic and treatment alternatives. As part of our efforts to raise awareness of sleep apnea and COPD, our medical affairs team focused its priorities to harness and analyze the over 2.4 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data available in our AirView cloud-based system. These big data-driven studies are producing important results that are worthy of publication in the peer-reviewed press and throughout medical conferences. ResMed is pioneering digital health research in order to drive better patient outcomes. During May, at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society, ResMed presented and supported over 18 studies in sleep apnea and COPD. We are not just leading the market in sleep apnea and COPD in terms of market share, but we're also leading with the best and top quality, world-class medical research. I won't go into details on this call of all these 18 studies; however, I'd like to mention a few that I believe highlight the importance of our products and services for all of our customers, from physicians to providers, to payers, and especially our most important customer, the patient. The first study relates to the global prevalence of sleep apnea. We convened a global team of leading researchers and key opinion leaders who looked at the prevalence studies from the many different countries around the world where they've been conducted. The team propensity-matched the population characteristics from these studies to calculate the new global prevalence estimate of 936 million people worldwide who have mild, moderate or severe sleep apnea. That is higher than the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic disease conditions that are widely regarded as a global epidemic, and a public health crisis. If you remove the mild sleep apnea sufferers from the analysis, the experts estimate there are over 424 million people with moderate or severe sleep apnea. Considering this, we and others in our space have barely scratched the surface of this disease and its prevalence around the world. Sleep apnea remains a huge opportunity and a strategic imperative for ResMed. We have to raise awareness and get help for these people – hundreds of millions of people who are suffocating each night, we need to get them aware so they can get diagnosed and get treated. On that front, we have two joint venture investments that are driving sleep and sleep apnea awareness. In our joint venture that is called SleepScore Labs, and our brand new joint venture with Alphabet and the Verily arm of Alphabet that is a joint venture that was announced during the quarter. Through these types of partnerships, we plan to continue to invest to help identify, engage and enable the 936 million people with sleep apnea to find a path to diagnosis and world-leading connected health therapy from ResMed. The second study to highlight is an economic analysis that demonstrates the successful in-home combination of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy versus oxygen therapy alone. Nick Hart (00:16:05) and his colleagues analyzed the economic impact of combining non-invasive ventilation and portable oxygen concentration and found that adding these two together saves money to the tune of $50,000 per quality of life adjusted year. That's an amazing result and we believe it will help drive adoption of the use of non-invasive ventilation. The third study I want to quickly mention relates to the patient benefits of the mask resupply program, which is a program to automate the process of resupplying masks by validating insurance, contacting the patient to determine if they need a new mask, fulfilling and then shipping that mask and then billing for it. Most insurance systems will let a patient receive a new mask two, three, or even four times per year. In a study of approximately 100,000 patients, half were on a resupply program and half were not. We demonstrated that for a patient on a resupply program, the likelihood of therapy termination after one year was reduced by more than 50% and there was a significant increase in the daily usage of PAP therapy among patients on resupply. These are meaningful outcomes and this demonstrates that resupply programs are an effective way to help patients achieve long-term adherence to therapy and thereby improve overall healthcare outcomes and lower healthcare costs. These three studies also demonstrate ResMed's commitment to support research from our over 2.5 billion nights of medical data to change the trajectory of two of the world's toughest and harshest chronic diseases, sleep apnea and COPD. Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2018, ending June 30, and we finished the year with solid revenue growth and even stronger operating profit growth. ResMed is positioned well as we head into fiscal 2019. Our connected health strategy is advancing across multiple markets. We've seen continued success with our new mask and device products and we have a robust pipeline of new products and new connected health and digital health solutions. We are positioning ResMed for the long-term, driving top line and bottom line growth into 2020 and well beyond. We're going to execute on our strategy to lead the medtech field to create value with digital health solutions to slow chronic disease progression, to also reduce overall healthcare system costs, and most importantly, to improve outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customer, the patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks on the finance in detail and then, we'll go over to Q&A. Brett, from Munich to Sydney, are you there?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $623.6 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $346.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $236.5 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Sales in constant currency terms in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $189.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $156.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $162.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 6% increase. Masks and other sales were $74.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $40.4 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform and an adjustment of foreign tax credits. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.1% compared with 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $156.8 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25.1% compared to the 26.6% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject of currency movements, we expect SG&A as a definitive revenue to be in the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. Consistent with historical trends, Q1 FY 2019 will likely exceed this range, while the second half of the fiscal year is expected to track at the lower end of the range. R&D expenses for the quarter were $39.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared with 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.6 million for the quarter, the increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $166 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $136.3 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar. As discussed during the previous call, we implemented a strategic global workforce review that was completed this quarter and resulted in a restructure expense of $7.5 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter is 22.1%. As discussed during the previous quarter, we have recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to newly enacted U.S. tax laws. This calculation is permitted to be provisional for 12 months after the enactment of the law. And as part of the current quarter activity, we further refined our calculations, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.8 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results. Additionally, we recorded a one-time charge of $7.2 million, reflecting the cumulative adjustment of our foreign tax credit position. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. And now turning to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. You will recall from last quarter, we have to take into account two offsetting impacts, unfavorable Australian tax reforms and favorable U.S. tax legislation along with estimates of the geographic attribution of our income. Taking into account these factors, we estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%. Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $129.4 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $31.7 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, representing a 6% increase on our previously declared dividend. We also continued with our share buyback during the fourth quarter and repurchased 250,000 shares for consideration of $25.9 million. As Mick noted, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on our acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst. HEALTHCAREfirst revenue in calendar year 2017 was $29 million. At June 30, we have $281.5 million in gross debt and $92.8 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.
Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. Tim, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Saul Hadassin with UBS is online with a question.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: We can hear you loud and clear. It's actually good evening here, Saul, in Munich.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Good evening. Good evening in Munich, Mick. Can I just ask about masks, particularly in the U.S.? So strong growth rate there. You mentioned market share – taking market share. Can you maybe comment a bit more on the contribution from growth in the resupply business? And cognizant that Brightree had some acquisitions during the year, the quarter as well, just in terms of the performance of ResMed resupply and Brightree, just how they are contributing to the resupply growth as evident in the mask growth rate this quarter?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely, Saul. We talk about sort of the devices growing in the mid-single digits and the masks growing at the high single-digits. And so clearly, 13% constant currency growth of our masks and accessories business in the U.S., kind of Latin America being 12% on a constant currency basis, we clearly took some share. And you saw in our sort of organic growth within the Brightree business, that was also in parallel actually a 12% on our Software-as-a-Service business. And clearly, that does through Brightree resupply and Brightree connected ResMed resupply, there are some combinations that are driving our share growth through not only first time set up of these great new masks, the N20 and the F20, but also through those resupply programs. So there's a combination of both of them coming into play into that really solid 12% growth number in the U.S. and really good global growth of 13% constant currency as well.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks. So just one follow-up on that. Just the launch of QuietAir, how significant or how material was that? When did it come – actually, when was it rolled out during the quarter?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. So it was rolled out during the quarter. And as you know, Saul, our market is not uniform and so it's multiple contact points, over 3,000 contact points within just one geography, the U.S., and multiple in many of the markets that we go to through homecare providers. So it's account by account and doctor by doctor. They get to see it and start to write prescriptions for it and homecare providers start to adopt it. In our patient markets, like Australia and UK, you've got to get the word out and they've got a big social media drives and all that to get that technology there. But, look, I personally use one of these devices in QuietAir, the ability to have that level of noise reduction to well below the air conditioning – most QuietAir conditioning system in anyone's bedroom is incredible and a great advance. And I think this technology has lots more legs than just one quarter and we've got a lot of runway to go in QuietAir. But it was really just launched during this last quarter and so we've got a lot of runway ahead on that.
Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much, Mick.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Saul.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is online with a question.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, good evening, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I wanted to touch a little bit on the device growth that we saw internationally. Can you give any more color in terms of how big of an impact Japan had? Are you seeing more patients getting diagnosed or are you seeing more fleet upgrades? And how should we think about that benefit over the next kind of 12 to 18 months (00:31:10)
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Look, we had some really good growth in devices in Europe, Asia and our global markets, 6% on the constant currency basis and actually even better growth within U.S., Canada, Latin America of 9%. We had the benefits of the changes in reimbursements in both Japan and France, which are the sort of S curves of growth that we've been talking about over the last number of quarters and those Ss will start to taper off as we talked about, but those devices that are now set up are 100% cloud-connected. And if you go back to the study I referred to in the prepared remarks, if you have a resupply program and if a patient has cloud connectivity, you start to get adherence rates in 80% range, just in cloud-connected and using myAir. And then, you add on the resupply program, which leads to even greater adherence. That combination we think will be powerful to be able to drive long-term mask and accessory growth across that patient group. So if you like, getting a connected device in there is the gift that keeps on giving.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, just to follow up with a similar question, in the U.S., obviously, the U.S. device number ended up being quite strong again. And so I think, generally, when you talk to investors, they'll be surprised that you continue to take share, you continue to see strong underlying market growth. So are you seeing existing DMEs or maybe already ResMed purchasers buying more of them? Are you seeing more of the fleets moving towards ResMed? Are you seeing that incremental buyer come in and say, I'm going to standardize on ResMed? Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up, Margaret. Look, I think it's a combination of a little bit of all the above. If our devices are able to save you 50% labor cost on setting up the devices, it's really – you have Adam Smith's invisible hand helping you choose ResMed at the homecare provider level. And if you're a physician and writing prescriptions and you can do this AirView based management by exception and automated connectivity and follow-up with your patients through the Air Solutions platform and particularly through AirView, then you're going to write more prescriptions for our product. So it's both of the above. And look, I do think, to your third point, we are betting on the winners. The people that are adopting ResMed's cloud-connected devices are the ones that are taking share in their geographies, whether it's the Southeast in the United States or whether it's Western France, and now in Japan. And so, I don't think that this is the end of it. I think this is the start of it. And as we said in the prepared remarks as well, Margaret, we're not satisfied with the current market growth, particularly with these new prevalence numbers showing over 900 million people with sleep apnea. We think that our partnership with Alphabet and Verily, and our partnership with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz to just drive awareness of sleep and then specifically sleep apnea so that we get more patients into the diagnostic and therapeutic funnel is a strategic imperative for ResMed. And we're not going to accept not being able to drive that market growth rate up as well as continue to take share.
Operator: Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC: Thanks again for the question. Just a few contribution questions in the quarter. Just wondering what acquisition contributed there and maybe just an update on Mobi, as that's under controlled launch and what your expectations are perhaps into the fourth quarter for Mobi? Maybe once it's under a full launch in 2019, how big of a market opportunity do you see Mobi and what does the margin profile for that product look like? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Anthony, thanks for the two questions. I'll take them in reverse order. I'll take the Mobi question and hand the contribution question over to Brett in Sydney. But, yeah, look, I know that here in Germany healthcare – ResMed healthcare office here in Germany, and there's really a great market and is biggest economy in Europe for portable oxygen concentrators. And so we think long-term, there is a really exciting opportunity globally for ResMed with portable oxygen concentrators. Our controlled launch is really focused in the U.S. primarily and it's about our go-to-market model. When you talk about market potential, look, there are a number of players in this space. We're not alone in having a portable oxygen concentrator. What I think we bring to the table is the ResMed brand, ResMed quality, reliability, the awareness amongst pulmonary doctors of our brand name. And I do think that will contribute a lot to the prescriptions that we've started to get and will continue to get with Mobi. But as I said in the prep remarks and you alluded to there, Anthony, we're doing a controlled launch and then we will go to a stronger, larger launch as we refine that go-to-market model. So throughout FY 2019, 2020 and beyond, you're going to see ResMed be a major player in the global portable oxygen concentrator market. And it won't just be having a device that filters nitrogen. Its' going to be a device that's smart, that moves with the patient and is mobile, is small, quite, comfortable, high-quality oxygen output and also, ultimately, a system that'll have connectivity and will link up to Air Solutions and all the value that we provided in digital health across the rest of our business. Brett, do you want to take the first part of Anthony's question about contributions from organic versus inorganic?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Mick, thank you. Anthony, we've got – I mean we've made a couple of tiny acquisitions over FY 2018. So in terms of group results, it was really pretty much de minimis in terms of their contribution. It's pretty much organic growth that you're seeing.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC: Thanks again.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Anthony.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch is on the line with BMO Capital Markets with the question.
Unknown Speaker: This is Steve (00:37:31) on of Joanne. Can you guys hear me okay?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Can hear you loud and clear, Steve. (00:37:35)
Unknown Speaker: Awesome. Hey, I appreciate some of the early commentary on the HEALTHCAREfirst integration and just piggybacking on the last question. But can you talk about some of the strategy behind combining it with the Brightree offering and maybe some of the revenue and cost synergies we should be focused on in the long-term?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So, really, HEALTHCAREfirst, I mean, as Brett said, it was de minimus. I mean, we only really just closed it recently and so there was no sort of revenue impact in the numbers that we talked about in FY 2018. But as we look forward, and as Brett indicated in the prep remarks, it's about $30 million run rate trailing revenue in this business and we expect that to grow pretty fast. The home health and hospice sectors of out-of-hospital care are very fast growing. We've got an aging population. People want to age in place. They don't want to be in hospital. They don't want to be in an acute care setting. And so we're really seeing great growth – just secular growth within those two segments. And HEALTHCAREfirst has an excellent offering and Brightree home health and hospice has an excellent iPad app and capability and really user friendly for the home nurses and the folks that are walking around hospice agencies and traveling around to people's homes for the home nursing and home health. So we are really excited about the strategic combination of those two parts of our business and we have some really strong leadership that have experience at much larger companies within this space. And we're very excited about those sectors. So you're going to see ResMed invest for organic and inorganic growth across the out-of-hospital software part of our business.
Unknown Speaker: Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up, just a competitive question, now that we have sort of one more quarter under your belt, have you guys seen any further impact from the masks from Philips?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I mean we don't go into details around other than the fact that we're taking share versus our competitors, but I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to give a little more detail. He's President of our Global Sleep business. He can maybe talk a little bit about the innovation of N20 and F20 and how they're beating the competition and how that works. Jim?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. See, as Mick says, we don't go into details about specific – really, in general about our competitor shares, specific competitive products. I'll just say that we feel very comfortable with our mask portfolio. The whole portfolio continues to perform very well both in the U.S. and in global markets. The F20 full face mask is performing extremely well and continues to be in a very strong leadership position in the market with the QuietAir vent adding to that offering. And we're very confident in our portfolio.
Unknown Speaker: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: David Bailey from Macquarie is on the line with a question.
David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. It's David from Macquarie. Just my first question is in relation to Mobi in portable oxygen concentration. Seen some of your competitors looking to employing a direct-to-consumer strategy. You've previously said you're looking at partnering with the HME channel in terms of your own strategy. Can you just talk through how you plan to go about things on the go-forward basis in the POC space?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And as you mentioned, there are a couple of competitors doing a variety of different go-to market models. Our goal is, we really like our U.S. homecare provider customers. The HME is a great customer base we partnered with for decades to help grow this market. And they have the best people to start working on reimbursement models and to understand Medicare reimbursement and private care reimbursement for POCs. And so we're really partnering with them on that. And we're also partnering with them on the best way to get the product to patients who want to pay cash. And so you'll see us work with the channel and help support them with many different models in this space. But rather than – because I'm sure our competitors will be reading this transcript or listening live to go into the details of that go-to-market model. I'll just say that our model is going to be more partnership with the channel than that what we're seeing, I think, from some others is competition with the channel. I just don't think that's a smart move. I think you want to partner and understand how you can grow as you have for a number of decades other parts of the business like our sleep apnea franchise that we've grown incredibly well with our U.S. HME partners and our French homecare providers, and our Japanese homecare providers and grow in those spaces. And so, obviously, every market in the world is different. We have different go-to-market models in Germany or Australia, New Zealand. But I think your question was about the U.S. market where our focus is partnership with the HME channel and helping both of us win. And additionally, really most importantly, helping that patient win and get access to ResMed's POC if they want to.
David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks. That's very clear. And just a follow-up from me. Just in terms of resupply in some of the new markets that you've entered, France and Japan, the U.S. obviously eligible for full mask to run. (00:42:59) How does the resupply criteria or eligibility criteria in the rest of world compared to what you see in the United States?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, David. It's a good question. Let's talk about the resupply side of our business. In the U.S., every payer operates differently. There are some private payers that is two full mask systems per year, 10 or more cushions per year. There's some that are three full mask systems and even some that are four full masks systems. I think what it's really about is checking in with the patient because you want to make sure that that patient wants the new mask, is ready for a new mask and is engaged in this therapy. And, David, as you heard me say in the prep remarks, when you engage with the patient around a resupply program and you're checking with them, do you want to be email, do you want to be text, do you want to be a live call. And you ask them, how, when and where they want to find that out, and to what level do we partner with the channel to check on reimbursement and to help them provide shipping and follow-up care to that patient. We're seeing really good growth of that resupply business. So, look, it's a long-term play. I think you saw in the quarter really good mask growth from us not just in the U.S., but also in Europe. Every market is different. You actually find sometimes in patient pay markets like Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, and UK, that patients are even more active in working with the adherence models because it's their own mask and they get to choose when they want it. But the really important thing is, ask the patient, get in touch with them, and we're seeing really good success as you saw in the quarter there.
David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks for the detail.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If I could just start with the restructuring, so we saw another round of restructuring going through, just if I could get you to comment on whether that's now complete. And then, sort of to the operating leverage, which has been such a strong driver of earnings in recent times, is a lot of what you're seeing going forward – going forward in the guidance reflecting the benefit from that restructuring or there a broader opportunity on the operating leverage front?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I'll hand the first part of question over to Brett, who will talk about the restructuring and then maybe, Brett, you can have a go with the operating leverage and hand back to me or anyone else in the team you think appropriate.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Dave, we – I mean, we've got – that's sort of like the global restructure was in Q3 and we did flag up that we'd have this final charge coming through into Q4. So that's essentially that one that's completed. And then, probably you sort of see some of that benefit from the Q3 restructuring, I guess, coming through. But that was really around strategically looking at kind of where we wanted to balance resources and so on, what we felt we needed to invest in. So it's a much broader picture in terms of what we're trying to do. If you look at the kind of operating leverage, we're pretty committed on that and we're really looking to see how we can do things smarter, or how we can do them differently. And then, really, looking at how can we achieve scale, and then as we grow revenues, grow SG&A at a lower clip than that. So there's a lot we're doing there, a lot we're doing around business excellence program and things like that. We're really trying to make sure that we're operating as efficiently as we can. But I don't want you to feel – we're really cognizant that we'll be continuing to invest for the long-term sustainable growth in the business, so we won't back off that whatsoever. We do think we can manage in terms of efficiencies and scale and then kind of how we deliver particularly around kind of back office, if you like. So we're continuing that program, but the aim is to support the long-term sustainable growth.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Okay, great. I mean, I might just switch topics. The sales line was pretty much where we expected and clearly very strong across masks in the U.S. The one part that was a little softer to my mind was the device sales outside the U.S., Europe and Asia, particularly in light of the commentary that we heard about France and Japan being strong, Korea perhaps a bit earlier stage. But is there anything else across the region that would explain if France and Japan was strong? Why perhaps 6% growth was – is certainly down a bit on what we saw in Q3. Just wondering if there's anything else happening in other markets perhaps?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And we did flag this last quarter when we saw pretty strong outside U.S. device growth in that high single, low double digits last quarter. And what we said was that some of the step-up like in Japan, where it's a fleet sale to Japanese home care providers based upon that telemonitoring chain that it would be sort of a one to one and a half quarter effect. And so, I think you're seeing that Japan – in and Japan out element from Q3 to Q4. But, look, 6% growth in devices in Europe, Asia and around the world is a really solid number. I mean you're talking mid- to single digits growth globally in that space normally and ResMed grew at 8%, so well above global market growth. And as we said we had a little bit of benefit additionally in France, but most of that is starting go away and we're starting to get back towards those organic growth rates in Europe, Asia and others. So I think it's a natural return to market growth and then some additional market share taking for those who still are switching over to the cloud-connected devices in France and to a much lesser extent in Japan. But, look, the real benefit, as I was alluding to in one of the earlier questions, is not just selling that one device and then resupplying that every three or five years based on patient upgrade or warranty models. It's really around the fact that a patient now on a cloud-connected device in a region where cloud connectivity is used a lot, like France, Japan and obviously, the U.S., is something that starts to drive really strong and sustainable mask and accessory resupply. And so that's really the benefit that we're sort of highlighting with these great telemonitoring tools. Yes, there's some great one to two quarter benefits in device sales, but most importantly, it's a patient whose life has changed. And therefore, when you ask them, text them, call them, do you want a new mask three months or four months or six months later, they say, yes, because you're contacting them the way they wanted and how they wanted and they're getting part of that resupply program. So it's good for everyone, then the payer because patients go in hospital, the patient because they're getting great care, and the provider because they're able to provide that extra mask and obviously for ResMed.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thomas Yeo is on the line with Goldman Sachs, Sydney, with a question.
Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, in regards to the recent CMS proposed rules, could you help us understand a few of the potential changes that is happening? Like, how is a lead product being defined? And also, what do you expect the change in proposed rules to have on the different mask categories?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So I'll hand that to Dave Pendarvis, who is with me here in Munich, regarding reimbursement CMS.
David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're pleased with the CMS proposal. As Mick mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be overall good for the industry. And the first thing I would point to there is that they've moved to the clearing price, establishing the reimbursed amount. And that in and of itself is something the industry has been asking for quite a while, and so that should be strong. There is some discussion in there about lead product and categories. And so it remains to be seen how much of that will come out in the final rule and how much of it will be handled by sub-regulatory guidance down the road, but we do think that if sleep is a separate category from oxygen, that's a good thing for our sleep business. Remains to be seen whether non-invasive ventilation would be a different category or combined with others. So that will have to come out in the final rules and guidance thereafter, but we do think that our focus on sleep overall is a good thing. And as a overall measure, what we really like about this is that the industry has been talking for some time about the need for change in the way this competitive bidding structure was operating. And CMS has responded. You have to give them credit for listening to the industry, working with the industry, and not just us but others throughout the whole industry have been participating in this process. So we have to give credit where credit is due. Now, there's still some things we'd like to see on top of that. I mean, the fact that in some of the non-competitive bid areas, a town like Niland, California, which is near the Salton Sea, or a small county that's outside of Chicago is viewed as no uplift, not really considered a rural area, we think that's an area where CMS ought to step in and provide some additional reimbursement. So there's always room to improve. The industry is still looking for improvement here, but overall, we think it's a good positive development.
Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks. And just a follow-up and kind of to switch topic as well, what's the progress being made in COPD? We have seen some supportive studies lately. Could you outline which of those are underway today and what you expect to be the most impactful and when do you expect them to read out?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer, who is in San Diego.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Thomas. So, yeah, there's been quite a few studies on and some of them were actually previewed in posters at ATS, but there were studies really looking at various sectors. The main one we've been talking about is the HOT-HMV study, which showed the benefit in terms of keeping people out of hospital by adding NIV on to oxygen. And then, as Mick mentioned earlier, that really had an economic study done to it, which showed a very significant cost reduction per quality of life here that you almost never see in treatment. So that should be really powerful. Other studies are ongoing. There were studies looking at really getting at identifying, which patients are going to benefit more and understanding how to get out and predict the patients that have high CO2 levels, which is really the patients that benefit the most from the addition of NIV treatment. It's a very fertile ground. Around the world, standards of care are still quite varied and there's a lot of opportunity for those to be normalized as these studies bear fruit, both from the benefit of oxygen, integrated or not with NIV therapy and then models of using them. There's a lot coming.
Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you.
Operator: Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you, and good morning or good evening. I have a question on AllCall connect. I'm just wondering, Mick, if you give us a bit of granularity around that. Like, how broadly is it adopted? How much of a driver in a broad – sort of the good resupply number as a start?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So, Sean, look, there's a portfolio of offerings in resupply. Within the Brightree Core, we had Brightree Connect and then we had our ResMed ReSupply model and then we had added onto that, which are both sort of automated, if you like, cloud-based AI type algorithms, ML type algorithms to contact patients. In addition, we added AllCall Connect, which is live humans as well as automated levels. And so, now we've got a portfolio of live and automated calling for people. And I'll go back to my comments a little earlier that it's really about finding the best solution for a patient as they need it. And AllCall is really just part of that portfolio. We don't break out how much is from the Brightree, how much is from the ResMed, which is for users of ResMed beyond just Brightree users, and how much is part of the AllCall. But what I can tell you is they're really well-coordinated on the back end and there's a skin, so it's pretty much invisible to the frontend users and patients won't actually know what back end system they're using. The others say, wow, ResMed is reaching out to me or we may even do it on behalf of DME A or B (00:56:01) and reach out to the patient. So, really, we're seeing a good growth across the portfolio of those.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Mick. And just one quick follow-up just to check a number. On HEALTHCAREfirst, there was no contribution in the current fiscal year and there was about trailing 12-month revenue of $30 million, if I heard correctly.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. The trailing 12-month is around $29 million, $30 million. Brett, no real material contribution, correct?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No, we closed that sales (00:56:29) in the quarter and, Sean, I think, it was on 9th of July. So just had it for three weeks. So, certainly no impact in Q4, but obviously that's a – we think it's a really good growth area. So we've got good expectations at both the Brightree and the HEALTHCAREfirst offerings in that space.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you, gentlemen.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup is online with a question.
John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Good morning. I was just wanting to turn to Brightree for a moment. Could you just give us a sense – obviously, strong growth numbers, a sense of the growth between new customers and existing customers spending more money with you? What's the rough split?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. John, we don't go into that much detail on it. Jim, who runs our global sleep business probably has a little more color that he can provide qualitatively. We're not sort of going to breakout per user per month type growth that we have as customers grow and/or take share and/or acquire other customers. But, Jim, do you want to provide any further color on Brightree and how we achieved those strong 12% growth numbers in the quarter.
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, Mick, and thanks, John, for your question. Without getting into granular detail, we're getting growth on both sides of that equation and not just out of Brightree, of course, but out of other offerings in the SaaS portfolio. So it's pretty balanced growth.
John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Maybe just a change text, you called out early in the call the prevalence of sleep apnea. What was the actual severe number? Do you have that separately because obviously it's quite important?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I just want to do some – I actually don't know if that study does break it out. And if so, we're really happy to share that with you, John. But what doctors call mild is an AHI or suffocation index of 5 to 14. So with 14, that's approximately just over every four minutes of sleep that you suffocate for 10-plus, minimum of 10 seconds. Every four minutes of sleep, 10 seconds suffocation, that's called mild. And if you talk about moderate, what doctors call moderate sleep apnea, which is an AHI of 15 to 30, and you're pushing 30, that's every two minutes now, you're suffocating for 10 seconds or more. That's called moderate. So, I think there's a difference between what doctors call moderate sleep apnea. And if you talk to a patient, say, hey, you're suffocating every two minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's moderate, but you're suffocating for every four minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's mild. This is what it is. To be called severe, you have to suffocate every – less than every 120 seconds of sleep for more than 10 seconds. You're starting to get close to 10% of your time in suffocation mode. So I don't know, look, I'm a mild sleep apnea sufferer and I use this device. Obviously, I'm passionate it as CEO of the company. But many people with mild sleep apnea are seeking treatment and don't want to suffocate. You don't wait till you really overweight before you start exercising, why would you wait until your suffocation index is every 110 seconds. But anyway, I'll hand over to Rob, if he wants to handle any further information about the severe element of that study.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Just one other bit of information, John, the reimbursement programs around the world would – may distinguish between mild and severe. And so in many U.S. models, you need a comorbidity and mild to get reimbursed, which is most people do have comorbidity, so it's very common, or just having it moderate or mild get you into it. So that's really why we focus more on the difference between mild and moderate versus severe.
John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Understand. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, John.
Operator: We have Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee on the line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much. Lucky, last, I think quickly on ASP, I know you've sort of talked about in masks business a bit, but you did talk about ASP declines. Was that regionally based, was it a European or U.S. feature?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. We don't get into details on ASP, but it was pretty steady changes globally, Andrew. So, nothing really different from the last eight to 12 quarters we've been talking about this.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Okay.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Pretty steady.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Okay. So, no particular region where you're feeling competitive or other sort of changing pressure?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, look, we've been going through a lot of details about U.S. reimbursement, how – actually, there were some really good news on the competitive bidding front in terms of where they came to in this quarter. So I think we're seeing pretty steady levels of ASPs in terms of those decline rates being steady over the last eight, 12 quarters. There's really nothing dramatic happening there.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: And a quick on Narval. In France, we're hearing that's doing quite well. Just I guess any color on how that's going?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I'm here over with the European team and I got to tell you, there's a lot of passion for our 3D printed medical device there with the Narval. I mean it's just a fantastic mandibular repositioning device and the reimbursement actually increased by over 30% in France with some recent changes for Narval. And it's a really well-run operation We have the 3D printers in Lyon. We have incredibly strong sales team and really aware sleep and dental sleep specialists and good relationships between the pulmonary and dental sleep medicine specialists. So, yeah, we are seeing strong growth. We don't break that out, obviously, by the numbers there, Andrew, but if you're doing your channel checks, I think you'll find that ResMed is not only the number one supplier of CPAP, APAP and bilevel for sleep apnea. They're also the number one supplier of MRDs for treatment of sleep apnea within France.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks Andrew.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Mick Ferrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Tim. And look, as we close the call here, I want to once again thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team in 120 countries for their continued dedication, focus and commitment to our growth strategy and our operating excellence initiatives. Throughout the entire fiscal year 2018, you've helped us deliver strong revenue growth and increased our operating leverage. And as we exit fiscal 2018 and we're now here in a positive trajectory as we start fiscal 2019. We remain focused as a team on our future pipeline of pretty amazing products and software solutions that change patients' lives, to improve patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, the physicians, the payers, the providers, and of course, the patients. Thanks for your time today this afternoon, this evening, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of our first quarter in about 90 days. Amy?
Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.: Great. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to contact me directly. And as I said at the beginning of the call, the webcast replay along with our earnings release and updated investor presentation will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2018 ResMed, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tim, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to David Pendarvis, Chief Administration Officer and Global General Counsel. David, you may begin.
David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending ResMed's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending March 31st. Joining us on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO; Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, our earnings press release and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018. These documents will be available on our Investor Relations website at investor.resmed.com (sic) [investors.resmed.com] (00:01:07). A replay and a transcript of today's call will also be made available at that location shortly after this call. Now on today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The descriptions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and will also be in our SEC filings. Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, such as expectations for ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but of course actual results may differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in our SEC filings. I'll now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Dave, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today as we review the financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I'll review top level financial results, business highlights and key announcements this quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett Sandercock who'll walk you through our financial results in more detail. So first, our top level financial results. I'm really grateful to our global team for another quarter of very strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, 15% headline growth and 10% constant currency growth, led by sales in Europe and Asia; and then those combined regions we grew at 16%, 1-6, 16% in constant currency. Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America grew 7% overall in line with market growth. At the bottom line, we are continuing to drive operating leverage as we did in Q2. Adjusted net operating profit in Q3 grew 25% year-over-year which was an excellent result and the outcome of our global teams' hard work and operating excellence. This translated to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92. We are proud of this strong top line and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team. Now some business highlights, and let's start with Brightree. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% year-on-year. The Brightree team has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years and there's a stable record of success. To show Brightree's scale, here is an interesting metric. In the last 12 months, Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests. By quickly and accurately responding to these cloud-based requests, Brightree helps its users reach more patients more efficiently, more effectively and more economically. In terms of next steps, Brightree is beta-testing with select customers an exciting, new analytics platform using data from algorithms that will generate actionable insights for customers to improve their business effectiveness and their patient care. We look forward to Brightree bringing value to customers with this new data analytics offering in the very near future. For the longer term, we are very pleased to continue to have Raj Sodhi, the President of our Software-as-a-Service business focus not only on Brightree but also on new growth opportunities in the global out-of-hospital software market. Raj and his team are working to enable an ecosystem of connected software and human services to create a frictionless network for data and information to move across the healthcare value chain, so that as people progress through their personal healthcare journey, their medical data can seamlessly follow them. Brightree solutions were featured in the interoperability showcase at HIMSS that stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference. Brightree's participation in these demonstrations at HIMSS with over 7,000 visitors touring the interoperability showcase is just one example of our ResMed and Brightree commitment to connecting the post-acute care industry and patients to the rest of their care settings across that digital healthcare ecosystem. The response from current customers, prospects, and industry stakeholders at HIMSS has been very positive. We will continue to showcase the power of an interconnected out-of-hospital software platform to the rest of the industry. Turning to our core sleep apnea and COPD businesses. We continue to pioneer new horizons in those core businesses with digital health. We passed some very significant milestones during the quarter that I think were worth noting. Our cloud-based patient management system called AirView now supports over 5 million 100% cloud-connected medical devices across the globe. More than 7 million patients are included in the AirView system for their AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirMini, S9, Lumis, Stellar and Astral device platforms. We are proud of the extent to which this market-leading system has been adopted around the world but we want to be clear that we recognize that this is just mile one of our digital healthcare marathon. All these digital health nodes connecting every day have produced an incredible resource. We now have over two billion nights of medical sleep and COPD therapy data in the cloud. I'll talk a little later about how we are turning this big data or big clinical data into actionable information for our customers and the ultimate customer, the patient. Our connected health strategy received another boost this quarter when Japan announced a revised reimbursement system that allows physicians to be paid for remote telemonitoring of CPAP patients. Japanese guidelines already require that doctors meet at least once every 90 days with CPAP uses. The new guidelines, effective April 1, have allowed remote telemonitoring to substitute for face-to-face meetings up to two times per quarter. This new system will allow busy physicians and patients as their patient pool grows to continue to receive excellent patient care without having to meet as frequently in person. In anticipation of increasing demand for telemonitoring capability, our Japanese customers have stepped up their adoption of the AirView platform and AirSense 10 devices, our 100% cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic devices. This was a factor in some of our very strong sales in Japan during Q3. We are confident that in the future, this will make it easier for patients who are not treated today to begin and remain on CPAP therapy, happy and healthy at home. Today, now, three of our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies, the U.S., France and now Japan all have systems that incentivize the adoption of our market-leading connected health solutions that includes AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirView and myAir. During Q3, the French market continued to benefit from its own telemonitoring reimbursement incentives where there's a differential between telemonitored and non-telemonitored sleep apnea therapeutic devices. France and Japan, combined with good execution in a number of other countries worldwide, have contributed to very strong growth of device revenue across Europe and Asia during Q3. This category grew 18% year-over-year in constant currency across those regions. Our U.S., Canada, and Latin America device business was in line with market growth this quarter, growing at 6% year-over-year. We continue to see very good adoption of our connected healthcare solutions in these markets by customers and patients and we continue to improve our offerings. We just announced that our patient engagement app called myAir, and that's for all of our Air 10 devices, is now available on Android-based phones. We're happy to now offer the same high quality in-app experience to all patients with myAir whether they use iOS from Apple or Android from Google, they can all use in-app care now, not the web-based care. The most important differentiator here at ResMed from our competitors is our people. Our passion, our skills and our dedication to changing lives with every breath. We were thrilled this quarter to announce the appointment of Bobby Ghoshal as our new Chief Technology Officer. This appointment enhances our management bench strength as we continue to build our leadership in connected health. Bobby has over 25 years of experience as a Technology Engineer and a Technology Executive at Wipro, Motorola, Freescale and most recently at Brightree. He has both the technical expertise as well as the cultural fit with ResMed to help us take our healthcare informatics leadership and data analytics solutions along with Dana DiFernandino (sic) [Dana DiFerdinando] and her team to the next level. We will continue to work with payers across the globe on a number of initiatives in this space and also regarding reimbursement and market access. Two recent wins are worth noting. First, France announced that beginning April 1, reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, so the dental devices that we sell to treat sleep apnea, would increase by 35%. Our product, the Narval MRD is a device that leads the market in France, and we will continue to drive MRD sales in France and other geographies where that category can be just as successful. Second, South Korea will soon begin reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea. This is a great opportunity for us to help the many, many millions of South Koreans who need our solutions. On the masks and accessories side of our business in Q3, we saw solid global constant currency growth of 9%. This was led by Europe and Asia markets, which grew 13% in constant currency in the masks categories. We are seeing good traction with our AirFit F20 and our AirFit N20 products in these regions. We're also encouraged by the success of our AirFit N20 Classic. The N20 Classic combines the comfort and seal of our InfinitySeal cushion used across our AirFit series with an adaptive forehead support for stability and to adjust the mask tension to movement. The N20 Classic is performing well in the very specific countries we are targeting and validates our approach to find unique solutions for different geographies around the world in over 120 countries that we do business in. The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 8% in our masks and accessories category, which is in line with market growth. We saw a continued preference for the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks by patients, physicians and our channel partners. To help catalyze even better growth as we look forward, we are excited to be launching excited to be launching a technology upgrade onto the F20 and to the N20 platforms. At Medtrade, we demonstrated the new ResMed QuietAir diffuser technology, which results in masks that are 89% quieter and that have 70% more diffused airflow. What does this mean? Well, with this technology, our full face masks noise level are down to 21 dBA, which is well below ambient noise in the bedroom. With ResMed's new QuietAir technology, we are providing patients and their bed partners with a peace and quiet they deserve for better sleep. We think patients particularly, as well as providers and physicians, will adopt QuietAir technology very rapidly, so watch this space. Now for some business highlights of our operating excellence initiatives across ResMed. We are pleased this quarter to be able to continue to show our delivery in operating leverage to improve our bottom line. We grew non-GAAP income from operations by 25% in the quarter. We combined solid revenue growth and stable margins with disciplined growth in SG&A which grew at just 3% in constant currency and research and development which grew at just 4% in constant currency. I want to emphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long term and they're about working more efficiently. They're about being more focused on eliminating waste and they're about working smarter. Let's look at a quick case study here of our medical affairs team and their operating excellence initiatives here at ResMed. The medical affairs team led by Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, has adjusted its balance between traditional, randomized placebo-controlled trials and new big data, clinical data-based trials, analyzing real world digital databases. Carlos has assembled a global team of key opinion leaders within ResMed and beyond to ask tough clinical questions and investigate them, leveraging the 2 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in their view. These efforts are starting bear fruit. Our medical affairs team is pending less money, reducing the time to complete the studies and increasing the number of top-quality clinical studies that they are completing and pushing through the publication. The peer review process and top medical journals have accepted that these data-driven studies are important and worthy of publication. In short, ResMed is not only a pioneer in digital health, we are now pioneers in digital health research, all with the cause of better patient outcomes. In one example, in this space, in the last 12 months, our team prepared a study looking at over 128,000 patient records. The analytical process took a few months and produced positive results and was accepted into a top-tier industry journal, The Journal of Sleep Medicine and the results were impressive, showing our patient engagement tools drive adherence to our CPAP therapy, significantly higher than typical adherence to a pharmaceutical pill. We continue to do other big data studies and we are excited that several abstracts have been accepted for presentation in just next month, a couple of weeks actually, at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society right here in San Diego, California. You'll hear more about these studies when they are presented, so watch this space. Finally, some business highlights from our product development teams. Our amazing product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned earlier, we are launching brand new QuietAir technology to our AirFit range, starting with the F20 full face mask, and our mask pipeline after that is full. As we speak, we are in the process of commencing a controlled product launch of Mobi, our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator. Mobi helps people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and others who require oxygen therapy to live life with fewer restrictions. Mobi's great balance of battery life, weight, and oxygen delivery provides patients with the freedom to continue therapy while being mobile and active which is what their doctors want, whether it's just around the neighborhood or across the country or across the globe. This control product launch is the start of our ResMed branded journey in the portable oxygen concentrator market. In the U.S., only around 8% of those people who are eligible to receive a portable oxygen concentrator have such a device. We think that's wrong and it's an unmet need and ResMed can help fulfill it. It's also part of our long-term mission to change lives in COPD. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world with this debilitating disease. Our goal is to give them better quality of life to reduce the cost of care and to help them keep happy and well at home and on the go. Finally, we are in the process of launching a new smartphone app-based sleep apnea screening technology in China. We call this technology sleep cue (00:19:56). Sleep cue (00:19:59) uses a very inexpensive lightweight tube combined with smartphone software technology to detect sleep disturbances that suggest a person may be at risk for sleep apnea. This very affordable and very easy to use solution will give our China team another tool to reach the many, many tens of maybe hundreds of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea sufferers in China. We will continue to keep you updated as this technology is launched by our ResMed and Curative teams across Greater China. Three quarters now through our fiscal year, we have achieved solid revenue growth and stronger operating profit growth. Our connected health strategy continues to play out across multiple markets with our digital health ecosystem now including over 2 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data. We have seen success with new and upgraded masks and devices and software solutions including the N20, the F20, AirTouch, the AirMini and upgraded myAir. We look forward to early results from our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator, the Mobi, as we move forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years. We have a robust pipeline of innovation for the future as well. Most importantly, we have a talented and motivated ResMed team serving patients in over 120 countries. We are positioning the company for long-term top and bottom-line growth for 2020 and beyond as we execute our strategy and lead the med tech field to create value with digital health solutions. We continue to be laser focused on our goals of slowing chronic disease progression reducing overall healthcare system costs and most importantly improving outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customers, patients. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll go over to Q&A. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $591.6 million, an increase of 15% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $317.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234.2 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $168.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $149.4 million, an increase 8% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $160.1 million, an increase of 31% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 18%. Mask and other sales were $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 13% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $39.9 million, an increase of 14% over of the prior-year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.2% compared to 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely change in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25% compared to the 26.8% we reported in Q3 last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the vicinity of 25% for Q4. R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.3% compared with 6.8% in the prior-year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 6% to 7% for Q4. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $159 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $132.5 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92, an increase of 30% of over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar. During the quarter, we recognized restructure expenses of $10.9 million associated with the strategic global workforce planning review. Associated with this review, we also expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million during Q4 FY 2018. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 15.4%. As discussed during the previous quarter, we had recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to the newly enacted U.S. tax laws as submitted under the SEC guidance if calculation is provisional until December 22, 2018 a year after the enactment of the rule. Based on recent IRS guidance on the new law, we continue to refine our calculations which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.6 million being recorded in our third quarter results. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charge I just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. We estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 13% to 15%. Turning to fiscal year 2019, we continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%. As we discussed last quarter, this rate reflects both the anticipated unfavorable impact of prospective Australian tax legislation and the favorable impact of the recent U.S. tax law changes. Now, I would like to update you on the Australian Taxation Office order that is described in our Q3 press release and our previous SEC filings. At the end of the quarter, we received notices of amended assessments from the Australian Taxation Office for the years 2009 to 2013. Based on these assessments, the ATO is asserting that ResMed owes a total $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest. Essentially, this is a transfer pricing dispute around the jurisdictional split of certain activities and the tax on related income. We do not agree with the ATO's decision on the issues raised in the audit. We intend to pursue administrative and legal steps to defend our position and we continue to believe we will be successful in defending our position. As a normal convention, we have agreed with the ATO to pay 50% of the Amended Tax Assessments, pending resolution of the dispute. We have recorded this is a liability in the current quarter. However, we have also recognized an offsetting asset relating to these amounts and have not recognized any additional tax expense in relation to these assessments. It is important to note that irrespective of the outcome of the tax dispute, we do not expect it to materially change our underlying effective tax rate guidance for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Ultimately, if we do not prevail in this dispute, there would be a significant one-time tax expense and interest charge recorded at that time. Finally, on tax-related matters, I am pleased to advise, earlier this month, we agreed with the Singapore Economic Development Board to extend our investment and tax incentive programs through to the year 2030. While actual incentives are confidential but broadly consistent with our original agreement which was due to expire in 2020. Moving on from tax-related matters. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $149.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $29.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. We also continued to have share buyback during the quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $19.4 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a new syndicated debt facility that provides for an $800 million five-year revolving facility with an uncommitted option to increase the facility for an additional $300 million. Furthermore, we also entered into a $200 million five-year term loan. The term loan funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the credit facility. We continue to progressively repatriate cash back to the U.S. enabling us to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows. At March 31, we had $800 million gross debt and $106 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with relatively modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to David.
David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We'll now turn to Q&A. We ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Tim, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon (00:33:08), everybody. How are you?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, Joanne. How are you?
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): We are doing A-okay here in New York. Finally, sunny. When I take a look at your devices and your masks and accessories, your international growth is particularly strong. Is there anything that you can comment on as it relates to that?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Joanne, by the way, it's sunny in San Diego as well. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have some items that were extraordinary, the change in reimbursement in Japan of giving physicians the opportunity to get reimbursed for telemonitoring visits, which they frankly need as they're getting overloaded with the in-person visits every 90 days with larger and larger growing sleep apnea patient populations meant that there was physician demand for telemonitoring capabilities which meant that our customers, the large home care companies in Japan, have certainly, in the last quarter and will continue to, upgraded their fleets to be even more cloud-connected. And so that meant, if they're using S9s in their pool, they needed to move to AirSense10, 100% cloud connected medical devices. So there's some extraordinary growth there in Japan. And as we also said last quarter and it continued this quarter, the reimbursement changes in France where there's a significant differential between the cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic device and a non-cloud connected sleep apnea therapeutic device in terms of reimbursement because the French government has seen that they get higher adherence through the coaching and techniques like AirView on the cloud-connected devices, they have a differential reimbursement. So I think those impacts in France and Japan are together moving beyond. And as you've been watching us the last two, three fiscal years, since we launched our AirView solution in the United States, we've seen some significant growth of that over the last two, three years and now in line growth in the U.S. So I think those are some of the factors that contributed to that, Joanne.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's very helpful. One of the things that Brightree brought to you was a very good platform in the United States. But my memory is that it was not as strong internationally. Can you discuss where that might be going and what your plans are there?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So certainly, Brightree is – although globally resourced, you know, we have software teams in various countries around the world that support Brightree, that it's focused on a customer base which is home medical equipment, HME companies in the United States and that's still the core focus of Brightree. However, Raj Sodhi, who is the President of that global software-as-a-service business team is looking and growing both organically and potential inorganically that business over the period between now and 2020, the period between now and 2025 as we look forward in our strategy. So, if you look back at a trailing 12 months, you've got 6%, 7% or so of our global revenues coming from software-as-a-service, the vast majority of that is Brightree, but we do have some other mask replenishment and other software-as-a-service revenue in there as well that will continue to grow and I think ahead of the ResMed Group within that software-as-a-service part into other geographies over time.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thank you so much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Joanne.
Operator: David Low is on the line with JPMorgan.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If we could just start with the restructuring charges, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more insight into what those charges relate to and what the expected benefit will be and I presume that we won't be seeing any more of that going into the new financial year.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look ...
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: You know, the...
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: ...I'll give you the high level sort of strategic rationale and then hand to Brett for some of the details, David. The strategic rationale was, we're changing to a more and more, as I just related to Joanne's question, a more and more software-driven medical device company. And I'd say with $5 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, the world's leading cloud-connected and remote-monitoring med tech company. And so, we're changing our go-to-market model to be more software-driven, more software sales and changing our approach to that. And so that there's some structural changes and others associated with that. It's really around Q3 and Q4 as Brett talked to. But Brett, why don't I hand to you for any further detail on that?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. So, I mean, it very much was a strategic view and just looking at where we needed to invest in terms of our talent and growth areas. So we've looked long and hard at that, and the restructure is probably focused between 200 employees and 250 employees impacted through that restructure or reorganization. We've got -we took some charge in Q3 and we do on the U.S. GAAP, we'll take the kind of balance of that through into Q4, but our expectation is that we wouldn't see any sort of significant restructures into FY 2019.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Okay. Great. Now, that's helpful. Thank you. Look, the other question I had is the operating leverage has been phenomenal. The SG&A growth, R&D to a lesser degree growing much more slowly than the top line. Is that sustainable? I mean, should we be assuming that SG&A in particular will grow in the low-single digits and through that the operating leverage will continue on out into FY 2019 and beyond?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. David, I'd parse that out into two categories. I think in the SG&A side, we'd like to see that grow well less than half our revenue growth. You saw a 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. We want to keep our SG&A growth below that, well below that. On the R&D front, there's different investments that we make in different parts of the business, the software side and in the device side. And I would probably say that we're going to look to keep our R&D as a percentage of revenue in the vicinity of that sort of 6% to 7% range. And sort of – so therefore, it might grow closer to – if we're keeping at 7%, let's say, of our revenues then it's going to grow closer to our revenue line. So operating leverage I think in SG&A and keeping that growth under control. And actually, we're just working smarter as I said in the prep remarks and finding systems and capabilities to solve problems and thinking more digitally and scalably about how our team approaches problems. Rather than just looking to hire more people, we can look to hire smarter systems and engage smarter systems so that our team can be more engaged on more strategic issues. That's sort of how we're looking at it, David.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with the question.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one from me is, just a little bit more clarity on France and Japan in terms of penetration of cloud-connected devices, and really a sense of can this be a multiyear benefit, certainly in these two countries and then beyond that, where you guys can continue to grow at this double-digit range above the market internationally.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, I'll have a first go of that and then hand it over to Rob to look at it. But, look, these are big changes, Margaret, that have happened and they didn't happen overnight. Our market access team has been working in France with the French ministry for health for the last 5 years to 10 years to talk about telemonitoring and certainly showing the benefits that we've seen in the U.S. And with our Japanese team, similarly, market access teams working with customers in the Japanese ministry for health to show these benefits. So, these have been multiyear campaigns of working on market access to demonstrate that cloud-connected devices have better adherence, they are better for the healthcare system, they save costs for hospitalizations. So there will be multiyear benefits. But Rob, do you want to provide some more detail as to sort of that S curve, if you like, of penetration of the actual devices that Margaret is sort of asking about?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. We're very impressed with the rate at which our U.S. customers understood the value proposition of connected care. And as Mick said, we've had multiyear campaigns to make those value propositions in other markets. We believe the value proposition actually is there in every market that we're in and then what the reimbursement structure is and how that works, but it does take time to run these programs and develop it. The French one, as Mick said, it's been the result of many, many years of work and really changing the trajectory of connected care and how it works. Now, the value of the connected care, as our data have shown, is that more people stay on treatment. And so long-term, there's a greater pool of patients in the environment that need to stay – cared for, they need to stay on mask, and that really is building on benefit that lasts long term in these markets. And we have seen that in the U.S. as well and we'd expect to see that benefit of making this treatment of sleep apnea in the home a much more accountable and transparent treatment to everyone involved in the system, keeps more patients on treatment and we'll keep growing it. We've got a long list of other markets that we're focusing on and we look forward to reporting our changes in reimbursement programs or major progress as it happens in the future.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up to the top line growth, you guys really mentioned multiple new product initiatives and a very full product pipeline whether that's on the mask side, Brightree otherwise. Is there a cadence of product launches that you guys look at per year, is it a couple, is it more than that? And what kind of makes you guys pull the trigger on one product versus another? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Margaret, that's a great question. Yeah. We have a very full pipeline and our goal is to bring a cadence of very innovative products and appropriate timing that the customers want them, not faster than patients need the next generation and not slower than customers need them. And I don't know, if you talk to any sleep apnea patient worldwide and say, would you like your product smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. They always say yes. So we know there's demand there and we really are trying to make sure that that cadence is regular and strong and not too fast because patients aren't ready necessarily to switch masks or to switch software technologies too fast, but it's fast enough to make sure that the innovation is there and can have, for the company, good, sustainable long-term growth, but for the patients ensure that we're making it smaller, quieter and more comfortable and more connected every time. A good example is the N20 Classic for this quarter. A product that's not quite as sexy maybe as myAir, but a needed product for some of those markets in Europe and in Asia and we brought that product to market for those categories in that basic nasal category mask and it's been very successful. On the other end of the spectrum, we got our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator on controlled product launch here in the U.S. and we're really excited to see how those business models go as we partner with home medical equipment companies to reach the 92% of people who should have an oxygen concentrator in this country and don't. And then when we get it right, we'll scale that to the other 119 countries we do business in.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Thank you. Good morning, Mick. I have a couple of questions on Brightree, is it – another good number. I don't know if you could help us frame perhaps the contribution from subscription pricing and maybe throw some comments on adoption rates for Brightree?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, Brightree has been part of our group for two years and has grown pretty well in double-digit range during that time and there are many, many HMEs across the country who use Brightree and there are many who don't yet use Brightree and that we need to get on the Brightree platform. It provides such efficiency in prescription management, in inventory management, in delivery of product and monitoring of patients and resupply of patients that we think the value proposition is there for the large chunk of the market that doesn't yet have Brightree. We do have the lead in software-as-a-service in the home medical equipment side and we plan to continue that. So I'd say there's a lot of road ahead but some steady growth. I mean, look, there is consolidation in the home medical equipment space. If you go back prior to competitive bidding, there were maybe 6,000, 7,000 home medical equipment companies, maybe now there are 3,500 or 3,000 or so. But Brightree works on a per user per month approach and we think that it has some good growth ahead. And we'll continue to invest to make sure that our software-as-a-service value proposition not only meets and beats the competition but looks around corners to see where those customers will need their next innovation from. And in addition to that, we're looking to add on capabilities, as I said, in other geographies around the world where out-of-hospital software is not limited to the U.S. geography.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Sure, sure. Thanks, Mick. And the other thing we're trying to understand about Brightree, it's not just about CPAP. But I wonder if this is going to help, Brightree will assist the rollout of the Mobi, for example, I don't know if you can give us your thoughts on that.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well. The rollout of the Mobi is going to be dependent upon the go-to-market strategy and the value proposition of that product within the space. So, look, as I said in the prep remarks, it's got a really good balance of that oxygen output, the battery life and the weight of the device versus the competition, so I think in the product side, it's going to do really well. And in the go-to-market models, we're really looking at partnering with our channel to make sure we can reach those patients, who need it and drive it forward. So, I would say it's more our relationships with our home medical equipment companies across the spectrum both the products we sell and CPAP, APAP, all the masks, bilevels and ventilators as much as our software platform. So, it will add to our knowledge and capability in partnership with our channel. But I'd say it's more our partnership and the other portfolio of products is going to help us with Mobi.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Got it. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Craig Wong Pan is online with Deutsche Bank has a question.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): I just want to touch on the U.S. market. I mean, fairly good growth there you said in line with markets, but I did note that it has slowed from the second quarter. So, from down from 12% down 6% to 8% now, could you just talk to the – put some growth there?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. The U.S. market – well, the global market, we say, is growing in that sort of mid to high-single digits. So, we definitely held share and in some categories, we took some share and some others we held or maybe lost a little in some of the masks. But basically, in in-line sales, I mean, if you think about our U.S. geography for the last 12 quarters, we've been ahead of market growth and you don't stay ahead of market growth forever and there are product cycles. But I think that we did very well in the U.S. market with the comparables and how we performed in the last 12 quarters to grow at 7% in the U.S., Canada, Latin America geographies. And I've got to tell you, we think it's a sustainable growth. And as you add on technologies like QuietAir, which makes those masks 89% quieter and the customers don't have to add any more SKUs, it will roll into the same F20 and N20 SKUs they have and so the administration, the channels all up and running within N20, F20 with a huge patient benefit improvement and therefore lower return rates, higher adherence, better for the payer, better for the patient, better for the healthcare provider. I think that you're going to see some very sustainable and increased growth in the U.S. geography. But look, we've got a 29-year track record of doing pretty well in the U.S. geography and I think we will continue to do that as I look forward through not just Q4 but all of FY 2019.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. And then just my follow-up question on QuietAir, I missed whether you talked about the timing release of that and then is that the main reason for sort of your expectation of 2019 being higher than the market growth?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So we launched QuietAir technology at Medtrade, so that was during this last quarter and in Q3 at the trade show. But look, yeah, as you said, it's an S curve, a penetration as that technology rolls out in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. And so we will see that start to roll through the customers in this quarter and I think when those demonstrations start to happen with the RTs, with the respiratory therapists and the people who do the setups and they get the demo where this thing is lower than 21 dBA, I mean that's quieter than the air conditioning in your office right now, it's quieter than however quiet you get to your home, it's quieter than that, that ambient noise. And so it's basically getting down to stretching the envelope of new silence. So we're really excited about the technology and I think we will watch and see how it goes, certainly the initial patient trials and the control product releases with this have been successful and the trials and let's see how it goes in the real world. We are very confident that this will be a successful technology for the channel for patients and for physicians wanting to prescribe it.
Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall with MST is online with a question.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Thanks very much for taking my call. Perhaps if I could just ask you the pricing environment in the U.S., and I guess just thinking ahead to the next round of competitive bidding in the positive reforms there, just your expectations where pricing will even out to?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew, look pricing environment is very stable in the U.S. and we don't go into details of what that is, but it's stable, there's no big step changes within the U.S. pricing market right at the moment. As far as details with regard to competitive bidding and where we're at in that sort of seven-year process with the U.S. government and CMS, Dave, you want to provide some color for Andrew on that?
David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Mick. Andrew, it's hard to say that the next round of competitive bidding is scheduled for January 1 of 2019. We've got no guidance from CMS as to how that process is going to be conducted and time is getting a little short. So it's not clear what the timing is going to be. However, there have been two significant changes to the process that came in legislatively, one, is that bids have to be binding this time and which means that you should eliminate the sort of lowball bidders who are maybe bidding low on one category to get another or otherwise you're taking to flyer. And the second change is that there will be no limit on the bid ceiling, you can bid higher if you like. So just those two factors alone we think will lead to more rational bidding. We've gotten some good signals from CMS that there should be some other reform coming. We'll wait to see when those signals actually turn into reality. But there's some good strong indications that you could see a better bidding process this time and certainly what we would support and we've been working with our partners and with CMS to try to make that happen. So time will tell, but we're encouraged.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Thank you. And just my follow-up, you've called out Korea, France, Japan is positive jurisdictions I guess, is there any other countries that we should be sort of focusing on where you think there's also a bit of positive momentum?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, Andrew, I mean France and Japan had that big change with telemonitoring. So I think there's a long runway of future growth there. I mean, you don't have to go far around the OECD countries to see where other telemonitoring capabilities and connected care, connected health capabilities might be growing. South Korea is kind of unique, where it's gone from no reimbursement to reimbursement. So that's a really sort of positive sign for a really long-term play of growth and access to – many, many millions of South Koreans can now get access to reimburse care, not just the people who could afford to pay out of pocket. So I think that's a really good development there. Other geographies to watch, well, we talked about the Sleep cue (00:51:54), this very low cost screening technology that just runs off a smartphone that's going to launch and 1.3 billion person market there in China. We're incredibly excited about the potential of that. But look, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're just launching the technology. There's a lot of technologies that go into a country like China and such adoption of smartphone-based buying and selling of everything. I was in our office in Suzhou and you can't buy a cup of coffee without using a smartpay from your smartphone system. No, you couldn't use cash, credit card only a smartpay system, so the technology adoption in China is just incredibly quick and so who knows if we can get above that technology noise and make it go. But I think that's another geography to watch there, Andrew.
Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee: Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: David Stanton with CLSA is on line with a question.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my questions. First one just a follow-up perhaps on Andrew's previous question. What are we hearing from the government around bundling and bundling trials, any updates on that please?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Dave, why don't you take that?
David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.: David, there's been no word on bundling as part of the CMS competitive bidding process. When that came out some time ago it was going to be a trial that would start in 2019. As I indicated, time is getting very short to even put out the basic rules for competitive bidding much less, some trial and non-bid markets. But the bottom line is we've heard nothing about it. We continue to have supporters that we talk to both in the customers and in the legislature in CMS who made it clear that we think that's a bad idea. We're hopeful it won't go forward, but we've heard nothing.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Right. Thank you. And my follow-up is can you explain a little bit more, give us some more color around how Brightree helps you with your replenishment of mask growth? Thanks very much
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, David. So we have two offerings for our U.S. customers with regard to replenishment of mask offerings for patients who want them. We have a technology solution called ResMed ReSupply, which we offer to customers that run on any digital backend system for their homecare company and so it's available to all customers across the U.S. And then we also have a technology called Brightree Connect, which is specifically for resupply of masks and accessories for customers, not just ResMed, but for any masks and accessories they provide. And so we have two technologies that we have out there in the market and they've got different capabilities and appeal to different sort of segments, if you like, of the market there, David.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Great. Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question for the day will be from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse is on the line.
Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks very much. So I just wanted to go back to international and really work out some of the trends, say, in the other rest of world markets particularly Germany, because you haven't really called out Germany at all this time.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, Gretel. Look, our German healthcare team, which is led by our CEO there, Katrin Pucknat, and I just had a conversation with her this morning. We've seen some really good growth of our German healthcare business over the last couple of fiscal years. And Katrin is really changing the approach and the service mentality of our go-to-market teams there in Germany. There was no brand new news in the last 90 days. So I wasn't neglecting one of our top five countries. I also didn't talk about ANZ, which is another strong growth area. We had really good growth in many sales in that sort of consumer pay segment in Australia and New Zealand and Catherine Delamare who leads that business is doing a great job. But look, within Germany, it's as steady as she goes growth there. And I think that as we look all the technologies that I talked about that we provide to our customers globally, we are providing to ourselves there too within our Germany healthcare business. And so, I see strong steady growth within Germany. But no changes yet to telemonitoring versus non-telemonitoring from reimbursement providers like in France. But if I was at the German ministry for health and looking at the success of France in driving increased adherence, low hospitalization costs and better outcomes for their patients and for the social security healthcare system within France. If I was next door in Germany, I'd be looking at that and saying why don't we keep up with the times and try to get ahead of them in digital health.
Operator: Thank you. We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Ferrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, thanks, everybody. And in closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their dedication, focus and commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter, they have helped us deliver strong revenue growth and increasing operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers: patients, physicians, payers and providers. Thank you for your time and we will talk to you again after the end of our fiscal year in about 90 days plus or minus. Back to you, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed's third quarter of fiscal year 2018 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all our shareholders joining us today as we review our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results, business highlights, and key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. We are very grateful to our global team for another quarter of strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue and double-digit profit growth, led by sales of our software, solutions, mask systems, and sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we're starting to see leverage from ongoing operating excellence initiatives, with net operating profit growth of 20%. We see more runway ahead for operating excellence as we move forward. Our diluted earnings per share were $1 on a non-GAAP basis. We're very proud of this strong top-line and bottom line performance from our Global ResMed team. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% growth year-on-year and we're pleased with the continued innovation and execution by the Brightree team. Turning to our global therapy businesses, we continue to build our digital health leadership and we now have well over 1.5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data. We continue to unlock significant value for our customers from these data, creating efficiencies for providers, simplifying workflow, and care delivery for physicians, and improving outcomes for patients and their caregivers and loved ones. During the quarter, the U.S. Government passed tax reform through Congress moving to a territorial tax system. This has liberated our global cash assets to be able to be invested without artificial constraints. We will now be free to invest in three new ways: one, growing upon our existing strong U.S. manufacturing footprint; two, growing our existing U.S. based research and development capability; and three, building upon our existing valuable U.S. based intellectual property assets. We will provide updates on all these areas as we move forward. Now for some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 12% on a constant currency basis. These results were fueled by strong growth of devices and masks, as well as continued strong double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily through our marketing efforts and those of our channel partners. Growth in devices for the U.S., Canada, and Latin America was 12% for the quarter on a constant currency basis. It has been three-and-half years since we launched the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians choose ResMed, because of the sustainable value proposition of our connected health and digital health solutions. The mask and accessories category grew 12% in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America markets this quarter. We have seen good demand across all mask categories. In the nasal and full face categories the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 respectively are doing very well. We continue to expand production to meet the growing demand for these products. Our newest mask technology, including memory foam capability, in the AirTouch F20 is receiving high patient comfort writings and is creating a new market niche for patients with the high sensitivity to therapy, a previously unmet, or at least under met market need. Revenue across Europe, Asia, and other markets grew at 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis. Mask sales across these markets grew at a very strong 16%, reflecting strong adoption of our F20 and N20 mask products. Device sales grew steadily at 5% this quarter across Europe, Asia, and other markets. ResMed France has continued to drive solid device growth, catalyzed by increased reimbursement for telemonitoring of sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices, a change which went into effect January 1, 2018. We're excited to highlight France as the first country to recognize the value of connected health by establishing a reimbursement system change that drives the market to a new world of efficiency and better patient outcomes. We're working with other governments and payers on similar initiatives, over the coming period just watch this space. I'll now take a few minutes to update you on each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our sleep apnea business we're making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected health solutions. We have begun to leverage the well over 1.5 billion nights of actionable medical sleep and respiratory care data in clinical studies and to provide insights that improved patient care and health care delivery efficiencies. We have over 6 million patients monitored in our cloud-based AirView system and over 4 million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices in their homes. We also continue to grow patient engagement. We have over 1,300 new patients who sign up for the My Air Patient Engagement app every day. We see My Air enrolment continue to rise exponentially, patient engagement is working. The bottom-line is people love seeing their data and when they do, they engage with their therapy more and more. With continued global adoption of Air Solutions, the AirSense 10, the AirMini, the N20, and the F20, these masks provide world leading fit, seal, and comfort. We see a future of solid ongoing revenue growth in this space across that portfolio. This quarter ResMed announced the integration of AirMini data with AirView our cloud-based remote monitoring patient platform. The connectivity between AirMini and AirView enables physicians and homecare providers to see patient's nightly data verified here and spot any therapy issues that need to be addressed. This gives physicians a great opportunity to educate and engage patients to reach the best possible healthcare outcomes even on their brand new travel device. We continue to show progress on the clinical importance of treating sleep apnea. The American Journal of Medicine published a ResMed sponsored study during the quarter including over 5,000 hospitalized patients. The study showed that diagnosing and treating sleep apnea in the hospital improved these patients' long-term survival rates. Undiagnosed sleep apnea is highly prevalent among hospital patients and there is an opportunity to simply and efficiently diagnose them in the hospital and ensure that they received life changing therapy post discharge. Following pathways like this will not only reduce costs for the healthcare system, it will also increase survival rates and quality of life for the patient. It is great to have more proof that we are not only saving money for the healthcare system, our therapy is also saving lives. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators form the basis upon which we are building our connected health and digital health capability for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. With over 380 million COPD patients worldwide and with COPD being the third leading cause of death and the second leading cause for rehospitalisation, we know that we can provide value for payers, providers, physicians, and most importantly, patients from these data. In San Francisco, a few weeks ago we announced Mobi, the first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator. Mobi offers excellent oxygen output and battery life and a great balance of mobility, comfort, and therapeutic quality to the many millions of people who rely on supplemental oxygen. We expect steady growth in this POC category throughout the year and we have plans for continued enhancements for ResMed's oxygen concentrator pipeline. Mobi forms a critical path of our spectrum of respiratory care products, along with cloud connected non-invasive ventilators like the AirCurve, high flow therapy, and our cloud connected life support ventilator called Astral. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management tools, and out-of-hospital software business expansion opportunities. This quarter our Brightree team announced integration alerting to improved reporting for home health and hospice businesses. The seamless transfer of data between Brightree and the post-acute care data analytics company called Strategic Healthcare Programs allows home health agencies to immediate receive accurate reports to help improve patient care and compliance. Out-of-hospital software continues to be an exciting growth area for us, with strong long-term growth potential ahead. On the consumer and wellness side, our joint venture SleepScore Labs launched its latest and greatest non-wearable sleep improvement system for consumers called SleepScore Max. This product is powered by ResMed's non-contact sensor technology for best-in-class respiratory and sleep architecture analysis. At the CES Conference in Las Vegas, SleepScore Labs announced a partnership with Williams-Sonoma to offer what they call the Robin Sleep System which is a combination of the SleepScore Max product and a Williams-Sonoma Mattress Set. This will be at their online stores and select brick-and-mortar stores. For ResMed, this sleep awareness partnership provides a pathway to inform the 50 to 70 million Americans who suffocate every night but do not yet know that they need to seek diagnosis and treatment for their sleep apnea. You will continue to hear more from us on the sleep awareness front as we move forward. We've had two strong quarters to start our fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenues throughout the second half of fiscal year 2018 and beyond. We are also well positioned to continue to grow our operating profit as we execute on our ongoing operating excellence initiatives. We have seen success with new masks and new device products including the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20, and the ResMed AirMini. Most recently, we are excited about our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator called Mobi. We are positioning the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020, as we continue to execute on our strategy and action, implement operating excellence initiatives, and lead the Medtech field to unlock value with connected health as well as digital health solutions. We have changed well over 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to drive what we call our triple aim in the out-of-hospital healthcare market. One, improving the quality of life for patients; two, slowing chronic disease progression; and three, reducing overall healthcare system costs. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a very strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $601.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree software-as-a-service business, our sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $329.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $233.4 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada, and Latin Americas device sales were $173.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $155.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales were $163.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $70.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was $38.7 million, an increase of 14% on the prior year quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. Tax reforms. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses, and litigation settlement expenses. We will provide a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.2% compared with 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Consistent with our comments last quarter, on a sequential basis our gross margin in Q2 was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates, and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY18 gross margin. Moving onto operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $151.8 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 6%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.2% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 25% to 26% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. R&D expenses for the quarter were $40.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in a constant currency basis an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.3 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157.3 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $143.8 million, an increase of 39% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1, an increase of 37% over the prior quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.07. The growth in non-GAAP earnings per share was partly due to a lower tax rate this quarter. Achieving a normalized tax rated 22%, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.83, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Now I'd like to spend some time discussing tax-related matters. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 93.3% reflecting one-time charges associated with a recent change in U.S. tax laws. U.S. accounting rules require us to recognize the effect of any tax law changes during the period in which they are enacted. Accordingly we have recorded an additional income tax expense of $126.6 million in our December quarter. Specifically this amount includes two items. First, the transition tax imposed on our accumulated foreign earnings resulting in additional income tax expense of $119.9 million; and second, the write-down of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets means a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $6.7 million. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%. Adjusting for the impact from ASU 2016-09 which governs accounting for the tax deductions for employee stock-based payments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11%. Our non-GAAP effective tax was lower this quarter because our tax rate in previous quarters have forecasted the repatriation of cash to the U.S. this fiscal year. The taxes attributable to repatriation will no longer be due in the U.S. because of the recent U.S. tax reforms. For the same reason, we now estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 15% to 16%. Now I'll turn to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. There are two important factors to consider. First, Australian draft legislation designed to implement certain base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, initiatives related to hybrid mismatches likely to be enacted in calendar year 2018 and be effective for our 2019 fiscal year. This will impact the taxation of our transactions between Australia and the rest of our global businesses and likely result in additional accessible income attributable to the Australian tax jurisdiction resulting in a higher effective tax rate. Secondly, the recent U.S. tax changes will reduce our effective tax rate predominately associated with a new territorial tax system which will allow for little or no tax on future earnings repatriated to the U.S. from our foreign subsidiaries. Taking into account, the impacts from both the Australian perspective legislative changes, and the U.S. tax legislative changes, and their estimates of the geographic attribution of our income, we estimate our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%. To round out the implications of the U.S. tax reform it's important to note that the U.S. legislative changes will be positive for ResMed from a financial and treasury management perspective. We will now have far more flexibility to repatriate cash back to the U.S. at little or no tax cost. We will be able to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows to invest in growth opportunities and undertake capital management activities. Moving on from tax-related matters, during the second quarter cash flow from operations was $132.6 million reflecting strong underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $29.4 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. Additionally, as we discussed during last quarter's call, we recommenced our share buyback during the second quarter and repurchased 100,000 shares consideration of $8.5 million. At December 31, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $160 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.6 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Christine, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.
Margaret Kaczor: Everyone thanks for taking the question. First of all you guys had a really nice quarter in terms of showing operating leverage and SG&A leverage, even taking all the moving pieces out. But maybe walk us through what's been driving the recent results in SG&A leverage maybe what the long-term level for that SG&A or operating margin could be and really what it gets down to should we assume multiple years of leverage here?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Margaret. And as we talked about on previous calls, if you look back over five-plus-years ResMed had around 30%, 32% of our revenue in SG&A and in most recent quarters we've taken that down to 27% as a percentage of revenue because we're able to grow and leverage our world leading scale within the sleep apnea and respiratory care and now out-of-hospital software markets. We expect that to continue. And as Brett said in his prepared remarks we want to leave this fiscal year with a run rate of around 26% of our revenues at SG&A and even beyond that as we look to FY19. And so I think there's a lot of runway left for leverage around SG&A. We're a global leader, the global leader in sleep apnea and respiratory care, and we have a right to win in out-of-hospital software and I think we can leverage that scale to grow efficiently. So I'd summarize that there's a lot of runway ahead over multiple fiscal years here, Margaret.
Margaret Kaczor: Good. And then just as a follow-up on international seems likes it continues to remain focus for you guys in relation in telemonitoring. I know you had some weird comps with China from the year ago period, but what inning are you guys today in driving telemonitoring internationally and are there any advanced talks on a national, regional level outside of France to drive ongoing fleet upgrades. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes, that's a great question, Margaret; it allows us to talk about digital health and connected health beyond just the United States. We've had excellent progress the last three-and-a-half years in the U.S. millions literally north of $4 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. 6 million patients in the AirView system, and that keeps growing every day. But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks it's fantastic to see a country like France where the government who paid most of the healthcare bill through Social Security healthcare looking at the sleep apnea space and saying there is an ROI here to invest in telemonitored sleep devices. If we have patients that have telemonitored devices they use them more and as the data showed that we published and the French government knows that if the patient uses their device more they stay out of hospital more. They have a better quality of life and in fact their survival rights go up. So the French government making that change, January 1, is fantastic, we think there's a lot of runway ahead across France and as we look across Western Europe and across Europe, Asia, and all the other markets that we do business in, we are in regular conversations through our market access team with the governments and major players in the United States and other for-profit payers and we will get the message through that having telemonitoring, having connected health and digital health, improves outcomes, lowest costs, and save lives. And we do think that other countries will follow suit after France and it's great to have them out there.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.
Sean Laaman: Good morning and thanks for taking my call. My first question is to Brett. Brett, could you give us a guide on the FX impact on GM in the quarter.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. As we mentioned Sean, it was pretty meaningful this quarter. If you looked at sequentially it was kind of in the order of 50 basis points negative. So it was quite a big impact on the gross margins. So, yes, if we know that we're kind of pretty pleased with where we end up with the gross margins because we have quite a big headwind on FX.
Sean Laaman: Okay, great, thanks Brett. And Mick, are you able to give us a bit of a guide on what features the Mobi has versus Activox?
Mick Farrell: Sean thanks for the question. Unfortunately for the call but fortunately for our sales team and our commercial teams has been long time designing again this product ready. We're not ready yet to publicly announce the specific features and capabilities. What I said at the conference earlier this month, and I'm happy to repeat here, is that this has got really good oxygen output; it's got excellent battery life and a really good blend of all the other parameters that are needed to make out-of-home portable oxygen concentrators, the best they can be. And by putting the ResMed brand on it running it and release it when we believe the quality is at the level that deserves that brand and that's what we're working towards.
Operator: David Low from J.P. Morgan is online with a question.
David Low: Thanks very much for taking my questions. Perhaps we could just touch on France again, Mick just you talked about the change happening from the 1st of January, just wondering what you're seeing there, I mean presumably from the results we're seeing, you saw good buying ahead of the change and sort of where do you think we are up to in terms of sleep replacement to take advantage of the new reimbursement structure?
Mick Farrell: Yes, David, as you indicated the reimbursement change went into effect January 1, but our French colleagues and customers and partners in the ecosystem in France have known about this for a number of months or quarters. And so there has been some, if you like, upgrading of the fleet from non-cloud connected to cloud connected devices over the last three, six months. We see more runway ahead of that for France. And really importantly, we see patients getting better care, using their devices more therefore using more masks, but most importantly, staying at a hospital and being well taken care of. And we think there is a positive domino effect here where other countries will see this change based upon real data including the data that we published in the Peer Reviewed press this quarter and say this is the right direction to go. So we are in active discussions well beyond just one or two countries here or 120 countries we sell our products into, we are looking to get the message out there that telemonitoring and cloud connectivity and digital health and connected care can save costs and improved lives. But more runway left in France and a lot more across the other 119 countries we sell into over the coming fiscal years.
David Low: Great, thanks very much. And just one other, I mean you had very strong sales growth which is really impressive. But perhaps if you could talk to market conditions, I mean, I think let's perhaps start in the U.S. trying to get a sense as to how much is this ResMed gaining share and how much is this market conditions picking up in terms of patient setups mask replacement?
Mick Farrell: Yes, that's a good question. I will hand that to Jim Hollingshead who runs our Global Sleep Business.
Jim Hollingshead: Yes, thanks David. I think patient growth continues to be strong. Globally, as you know, sleep apnea is underdiagnosed and we are continuing to see increasing awareness in the markets and increasing patient setup. There is a little bit of cyclicality in the mask business especially in the U.S. because of the way deductibles, end of the calendar year and so we always get a little bit of pick up in masks, with some cyclicality, but the underlying growth in the market I think is driven by patient awareness, and obviously the economy has been a little bit stronger, so overall positive in both directions.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.
Joanne Wuensch: Good afternoon, very nice quarter. Can you spend a moment talking about your Mobi portable oxygen concentrator? How is that going to be sold into the home? Will you combine that with your current home CPAP sales force? Are you going to build out something separate?
Mick Farrell: That's a great question, Joanne. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer.
Rob Douglas: Yes, thanks, Mick. Joanne, we are currently selling the Activox throughout our existing sales force and doing that very successfully and the license ship and the discussion for customers around the world are very relevant and portal oxygen we think represents a really good business opportunity for many of our customers around the world. Mobi, as ResMed brand, will just be an extension of that and a stronger player and that will be part of our existing sales teams. Mobi and we are really looking forward to it coming out, we're really excited about it, it's going to have fairly strong performance.
Joanne Wuensch: As a follow-up, were there anything -- was there anything specific in the quarter extra selling days, stocking, anything particularly of note that we should be able to factor in to as we think about this quarter but also project on to next year?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks Joanne. No nothing out of the ordinary in this Q2 in terms of the channel. I think what we're seeing is we've had three-and-a-half years of the Air Solutions and AirSense portfolio that's incredibly value for customers. They continue to buy those sleep devices and those respiratory care devices that fit on the AirView platform. And we're seeing really good traction of N20 nasal mask and the F20 full face mask. These are the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable in their category. The plastic that fits on the bridge of the nose on an F20 and N20 is the thinnest and most comfortable plastic that you can have of any mask on the market. So I think that's what's leading to the share gains that we got this quarter and I think there is some sustainability to those share gains as we look forward.
Joanne Wuensch: All right. Very helpful. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Joanne.
Operator: Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question.
Steve Wheen: Yes, good morning. Just a question around gross margin for Brett. You've obviously got in this quarter a particularly large headwind from currency and therefore the offset through manufacturing efficiencies was obviously pretty compelling. What's the runway like on those manufacturing efficiencies for the back half of the year because I expected actually must improve, mainly because the currency now has probably gotten even bigger headwind to come given the strength of the Aussie dollar recently? Can you just sort of talk through how that might look and what are the moving parts going into the back half of the year?
Brett Sandercock: Sure, Steve. I mean we have a program around kind of initiatives in both manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and so on to really work on a number of initiatives and we're kind of keep track of that pipeline pretty full, then it's a matter of executing on those and in the time when they drop. So let's not get overly granular but we’re working on that all time and we expect to kind of drop if you like initiatives that will take cost out over a period of time and there will be some of those will manifest in the second half. But it's only progressive and it's a long-term program and you just got to continue to execute on the initiatives you identify and keep that pipeline full and that's certainly what the team done. So I guess it's more progressive, Steve, rather than sort of sudden big jolt to it. So we just got to keep executing on those initiatives and that will continue to drive cost out of the all that COGS area.
Steve Wheen: And so even with the Aussie Dollar at $0.80, you still got the ability to maintain that gross margin at current levels with the procurement side and manufacturing efficiencies?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I mean guiding to be broadly consistent right. We will have some headwind with Aussie at $0.80. I mean clearly if that keeps tracking up that's a different ball game but at the moment, I mean, it's a quarter away, so into Q3 it won't be so bad, if you look into Q4 then clearly there is a bit of a headwind there but we've kind of managed currencies on the Aussie all the way from mine [ph] time $0.47 to $1.03. So I think we just got to -- we just have to live with currencies moving around and make sure that we've got initiatives in place I guess to counteract that. But also I mean we will get much more broader on our manufacturing nowadays compared to what we were a decade ago. So we have manufacturing in Singapore, for example, it's pretty big, we had some in the U.S. now that we are undertaking. So I guess that portfolio is a little more balanced and then clearly as you know over many years on the material side it was really looked as sort of space or even essentially U.S. dollars to try and mitigate some of that. So it certainly has an impact but I guess there is some things we do to try and mitigate that and we've just a got to live with the currency whichever way it goes.
Steve Wheen: Okay. And just with the tax changes one of the problems as you've identified is some of the repatriation in historically and now that that's some of those barriers have been somewhat removed. Is this the opportunity that you're talking to of actually capital management initiatives is that sort of the first, sort of cap off the rank with regards to what you'll be able to do now that you can shift that cash around a little bit more freely.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I mean, we certainly have the flexibility now. I guess with the reviewing that's kind of I wouldn’t want to sort of preempt anything just yet but it does give us that flexibility. The clear will be around being able to utilize that cash essentially anywhere in the world and that could mean growth opportunities, acquisitions, investments where we might want to undertake. We have far more flexibility to do that. And additionally and it's not necessarily either/or, but we would have, I think the ability to do some more capital management as well. I mean, there's a few things in the tax reform you've got some limits or caps on interest deductibility and things like that. So you have to navigate a few things but for us it will, it's a great benefit for us because the flexibility is much greater than we had before. And we've kicked off the buyback for example in Q2 we will continue with that at the moment I expect it to be relatively modest or just offset the equity share grants to employees for example just sort of their $1 million to $1.5 million annually. But we certainly have more flexibility around that but not -- we don't have everything completely planned at this stage I think we're just assessing through on our options and so on.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of David Stanton from CLSA.
David Stanton: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could explain how Brightree and ResMed are going about increasing mask replenishment and in particularly in the U.S. market. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yes, look I've been out to often and then maybe Jim can add into that. We have some excellent programs with Brightree Connect and ResMed ReSupply some platforms that we've enhanced and put together to provide an end-to-end service for our HME customers who want to get involved in ReSupply programs. We have automatic, email, text, interactive voice response that we can provide to our customers to go directly to their patients. We have dropship programs where we can dropship directly to the patients if the care companies require that or want that and so many offerings in that and every day we are looking at ways to upgrade our ReSupply programs including in guiding patients with their with their my applications. We think that there is an underutilization if you like of patients saying they want to get a clean mask when they need a clean mask because they don't know it's available in the options therefore. They don't know the co-pay, they don't know the timing. So we want to turn that ignorance into education and educate patients that when their mask does start to go up and/or their mask starts to get dirty they can get a new one. And this is a piece of plastic that touches your face for seven hours a night, every night, it needs to be replaced on a regular basis and we think there's an under met need to drive that. Any further detail Jim?
Jim Hollingshead: I think the only thing I would add to that is the reason there are two platforms is because Brightree Connect is really designed for our HME customers who are using Brightree as their billing platform and there's many thousands of those, there is also thousands of HMEs that's don't use Brightree as their billing platform and so the ResMed ReSupply platform is really designed to be agnostic of billing since it will be usable by HMEs who are on the Brightree billing platform. In that way the two offers effectively cover the entire market.
David Stanton: Thank you. And my follow-up is given your strong numbers in the U.S. in particular I wonder you should give us an updated -- your updated thoughts on U.S. market growth rates and indeed perhaps some European market growth rates as you see them going into 2018. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, David. We look at the global sleep apnea respiratory care market that we play in growing in that mid-to-high-single-digits with devices growing at the mid-single-digits and masks systems growing at the high-single-digits. Yes, clearly this quarter we took share in both of those categories. Air Solutions, AirView and the AirSense10 and AirCurve 10 systems themselves helped us gain share in the device side and these new masks not perfectly new now three or four quarters after launch but they're still growing well in the nasal and full face categories with the N20 and the F20. And I got you to tell you the AirTouch F20 that full mask has formed a nice little niche for those patients who are very sensitive to their -- to plastic on their face and now have a far more comfortable foam that they can have there. I think the market is in that mid-to-high-single-digits. I think we took share in this last quarter and then we have the capability of taking share over further quarters. But we're also putting 6%, 7% of our revenues into research and development to make sure we have a regular cadence of innovation to bring on the mask front as well as on the software front which we upgrade on a four to six weekly basis with the cloud upgrades.
Operator: David Bailey from Macquarie is on line with a question.
David Bailey: Yes, good morning. I just had a question on the average selling price decline just highlighted this quarter. It's been an impact over the past few years so I just wondered if you'd willing to characterize the decline you saw in second quarter relative to the industry?
Mick Farrell: Yes, David we don't, haven't for four years given out ASPs.
David Bailey: That’s fine. Thank you very much. And just in relation to currency, you've historically provided an impact on a per share basis in previous quarters just wondering if you're able to provide us with the overall impact of currency on a per share basis for the other second quarter.
Mick Farrell: Sure, Brett you want to take that question?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, for this quarter was $0.02 favorable for us, which is really the reflection of the stronger euro. So it was $0.02.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is online with a question.
Matt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask was around your device growth. It was pretty strong this quarter on a tough comp and curious if you could give us any color on some of the components I know you mentioned that the Air Solutions and AirSense platform continues to grow well. And you talked about vents. Can you talk about the different kind of sub businesses within devices and how each of those are doing?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks for the question, Matt. We don't break out the detail between the sleep devices and the respiratory care devices. But I can breakout by geography that the devices grew globally at 9% on a constant currency basis. In Europe, Asia, and our other markets around the world it was around 5% growth of the devices and in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America groups combined we grew at 12%. A way to think about why does that relative growth by geography is the penetration rate all their solutions in the digital health and connected health platforms. The more that we're able to show that data with our customers of managing a fleet of products or managing a fleet of patients within the digital health platform enables them to see the value, reduce their labor costs when they use a ResMed device through at ecosystem their labor costs for setting up sleep apnea therapy go down by up to 59%. So that's a big compelling value proposition that you want to buy ResMed. As I said during earlier in the Q&A and during the prepared remarks we have had some success in France of getting differential reimbursement for that and I'd say that's the first geography outside the U.S. that will have now sort of an S-curve of growth if you like of the digital side that allows to bring some of that faster device growth there. But look out our French team are doing an amazing job firstly in market access and talking to the government but also in execution of driving that and we would like to see that continue their in France but also across Western Europe and other markets we participate in.
Matt Taylor: Thanks for that. I just had one follow-up for Brett. I think there's a lot of things moving around on the tax line and I was wondering if you could give us some sense for when you're developing these ranges for the second half of fiscal 2018 and 2019? How much of that is still kind of moving around and what are the factors we should think about that could actually move those ranges up or down or moving within the ranges.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure. I mean, it is -- I mean all of this is very recent and there's been a lot of activity, so these are all if you like our best estimates going forward given what we know about the draft Australian legislation and also the U.S. tax reforms. So put that guidance out there, which I'm recently confident on but they are estimates. And -- looking forward the impacts it'll just be around geographic mix of income and operations. Okay, so as operations evolve in different geographies and that can impact your tax rates typically over time. So that would be kind of longer-term impacts that you might see but on shorter-term I think that's going to be our best estimates with what we know on the legislation which you know is very hot off the press. So clearly, we will generally refine that as we go through the quarters if we need to.
Operator: Vic Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.
Vic Windeyer: Hi, just quickly firstly I just wanted to understand the tax. The lower tax that brought non-GAAP back from $1 to $0.83 can you just tell us what would just be?
Brett Sandercock: Yes in terms of the non essentially I broke down to -- we were forecasting some repatriation which would typically have U.S. tax attributed to it under the new tax reforms which came into forth any repatriation we make is no longer taxed in U.S. So that does in fact impact is favorably FY '18 and that has lowered our tax rate on a non-GAAP basis not having to payback tax in the U.S.
Vic Windeyer: Okay, all right, great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just in the respiratory care business I guess the -- end of that second horizon of growth I suppose that when do we sort of expect that that mark through inflection point then we go higher rate of growth out of that business given the large opportunity that resonates some of that back at sort of maybe been on slightly to the point of being modest? So I was just wondering whether you could outline how you see that coming through and the timing on that?
Mick Farrell: Yes Vic, it’s Mick here. Look there are the 380 million COPD patients out there, we think somewhere around 10% of them will and should have some type of therapy whether it's non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator, and/or life support ventilation. So it’s a huge long-term opportunity but it’s not overnight and it takes a long time. I think a really important factor about that second horizon of growth for us is that the money that can be saved for the healthcare system is huge. These 380 million patients are incredibly expensive for the healthcare system, they come back and back and back again to the emergency room and they get re-hospitalized within 90 days on a very high frequency and when they use our products and we show this in the HOT_HMV study when they use our non-invasive ventilator and they use our oxygen concentrator together, we can reduce hospitalizations by 51%. So look like we did with the French government and working with them on telemonitoring and showing the return on investment, we are going country by country, payer by payer in the full profit country insurance markets and showing these data. So it’s not in overnight. ASCO it’s market by market but we see a lot of runway ahead and when we launched the Mobi, we will have another part of the portfolio in there another ResMed brand that is part of the portfolio to add in there. So as you look forward to next couple of fiscal years, you will start to see some good growth out of our respiratory care business.
Vic Windeyer: Good. And then just on the tax, for a follow-up, what was the tax be in FY ’19 Brett, if the Aussie legislation doesn't get through? What is the impact of that particular component there?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, in the unlikely event it didn't go through then that would likely pull it back to closer, closer to the corner right, so we are saying second half. So yes more like that $0.15, $0.16, $0.17 are if it didn't go through or happen to be delayed or something like that. But I think that's a very low likelihood, I think that's going to parliament in February and I expect that to be passed.
Operator: Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with a question.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So Brett you mentioned 50 bps negative FX impact. Can you split out the impact because the dollar, the U.S. dollar as we know has depreciated quite a bit against the Euro whether you want to look at it from the beginning of 2017 or even from the beginning of 2018, the Aussie Dollar obviously has strengthened so I understand they are working against each other but is 50 beeps the net impact and if you could kind of give us what happened from a revenue perspective what was the FX impact on the top-line.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, the top-line was that kind of grow that grow from a 11% to 13% so that couple percent benefit if you like with the strong euro year-on-year. The 50 basis points I mentioned was sequential that's coming through from Q1 to Q2 and if you look at the kind of Euro sequentially it was relatively flat but all the -- has been kicking up and then we have the impact of one quarter lag. So you've seen that appreciate over that time. That has driven that sequential impact for us.
Suraj Kalia: Got it. And Mick one question for you in terms of Brightree can you give us the broad contours of your international strategy? Congrats on a nice quarter.
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks Suraj. Brightree really is a U.S. designed and operated software. However we do have software programmers who are in the UK and in other parts of the world, so it is a globally supplied business. We operate in 120 countries, the amazing efficiency that we brought to our U.S homecare customers with Brightree, I wouldn't want to limit to just that country. Having said that I don't want to distract the team from the really strong teams level double-digit growth and so they will be focused on that but Suraj it's a good question and one we're looking at and we are looking at other geographies including ones that where we're heavily invested to think can we start some pilot trials and experiments some greatest experiments if you like of taking the Brightree technology to some of the other markets that we do business in. So I guess that's part of our Horizon three strategy that out-of-hospital software expansion you'll see us talk more about that as we go forward.
Operator: Tom Godfrey from UBS is online with a question.
Tom Godfrey: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me with regards to the new AirTouch memory foam cushion sort of set up I'm just wondering if you've heard from any of your customers always it's got the 30 day replenishment schedule anything from your customers around pushback from funders just given that increased replacement run rate or are you managing to show enough sort of uplifting compliance or comfort levels, so that funders are happy to increase replacement. Thanks a lot.
Mick Farrell: Yes, it’s a good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead from our global sleep business perspective.
Jim Hollingshead: Yes, thanks Tom. I think the most remarkable thing about mask is the patient feedback we receive on it. It's an incredibly comfortable mask and the patient feedback is really almost overwhelmingly positive on it. From a funding perspective as we take it as our channel partners we're working with them for them to fully understand the replenishment cycle and what impact that might have depending on what insurance the patient has or what the funding situation is patient by patient. And so we haven't heard any real feedback, any real negative feedback from the market probably about the mask but it’s being put on patients who for whom it's appropriate given there in particular either health insurance situation or they're paying out of pocket or whatever.
Mick Farrell: Yes, I mean I'd one to that it's such a comfortable mask that it could be a second line of defense if a patient doesn't tolerate LSR or plastic touching their face, there are people who object to that it interferes with their sleep. Foam is incredibly comfortable it’s what lot mattresses are made out of it feels more like the bedcovers and so it's a great niche that I think goes after those customers who need that and as Jim said it will depend on the insurance and the reimbursement schedule but also depends on that individual patient selection. And if you're able to get a patient compliant versus not compliant the difference is as we showed in those published data a huge for the healthcare system, so they're sort of self evident but obviously we're collecting health economics and market access data while we launch a product like this into all our markets.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Great thanks Christine. In closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their execution on our product launches and their commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter that work translated into continued market share gains, strong revenue growth, and excellent operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers, patients, physicians, payers, and providers. Thank you for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days.
Agnes Lee: Okay, thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Christine you may now close the call.

Mick Farrell: Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders that joining us today as we review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then cover some business highlights and discuss some key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett Sandercock, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. We are very grateful to our global team for a very strong performance this quarter. We achieved double-digits global revenue growth led by sales of our software solutions, our mask systems and our sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we grew operating profit 12% and our diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis. We are proud of this solid top and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team. Brightree’s growth continues to be strong at 15% year-on-year inclusive of tuck-in acquisitions. We are making great progress as we expand our connected care offerings for all of our customers creating efficiencies and improving patient outcomes. Now let me cover some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth at 11%. These results were fueled by strong growth in devices and masks as well continued double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily. Growth in devices in these countries was 8% for the quarter. It has been over three years since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions cloud-based software and we continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find ongoing sustainable value from our connected care solutions. The masks and accessories category grew 13% in the U.S., Canada and Latin America countries this quarter. We've seen good demand across all mask categories. The AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 masks are performing well and we are able to fully supply the fast growing demand for these products. Our brand new AirTouch F20 is in its very early days and has high patients comfort ratings right out of the gate. Device sales in the combined European and Asian countries were up a very strong 9% this quarter on a constant currency basis. ResMed France achieved very strong device growth catalyzed by the announcement of increased reimbursement for telemonitored sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices. We expect to continue our connected care value creation for our customers across Europe and Asia Pacific as we expand digital help and connected care globally. Across Europe and Asia, our teams achieved strong mask growth of 15% this quarter. We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum: patients, physicians and homecare providers. I’ll now take a few minutes to update you on our three horizons 2020 growth strategy and then I will hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products enhanced by digital health and connected care. We now have over six million patients monitored with AirView software and over four million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables. In addition, we have seen over 1,300 new patients’ signup for the myAir patient engagement app every single day. It turns out consumers love seeing their own data. We are expanding globally with our connected care solutions translating the value creation that we have brought to our customers in the U.S. over to France and across Europe and beyond. In September, we featured our recently launched travel CPAP solutions, the ResMed AirMini at the European Respiratory Society Conference in Milan. There continues to be the demand and interest for a category of small travel-friendly second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. We are focused on growing this category all around the world with particular success in existing cash pay markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada and the UK. This quarter ResMed and Brightree launched another integration solution. Together, we provide a seamless solution for all homecare providers through automated resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree Connect and AirView software. With this enhancement, AirView automatically alerts Brightree Connect once the patient has achieved compliance criteria. So that the patients can be automatically enrolled into the Brightree Connect resupply program. This feature helps our homecare customers to ensure that every sleep apnea patient is getting the supplies that they need in order to have the best possible therapy experience while saving the customer labor costs through software automation. This enhancement is the latest in a growing list of time saving features for our customers that maximize both the patient benefits as well as homecare provider benefits. Brightree also launched ConnectPRO at the Medtrade Industry Conference just earlier this week. ConnectPRO is a comprehensive solution that combines all technology services and data analytics that are necessary for our homecare customers to efficiently manage resupply workflows and to improve patients' resupply engagement. Our connected care strategy is also having a positive impact on the clinical front with ongoing publication of studies. The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine known more simply as The Blue Journal published a study run jointly by ResMed and Kaiser Permanente, which reported that remote monitoring improve the patient adherence to sleep apnea therapy. The key takeaway from the study was that telemonitoring of sleep apnea patients with ResMed's algorithms resulted in an increase of therapy adherence of 22% to 37%. This is statistically significant and also clinically significant data. We look forward to more publications using ResMed's database of the identified aggregated data. We are transforming big data of more than 1 billion nights of sleep metrics into actionable information that can improve clinical outcomes. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. Our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and light support ventilators continue to grow globally and we are building our connected care strategy for COPD. We relaunched our portable oxygen concentrator called Activox with improved quality and performance at our U.S., Canada and Latin America Sales Conference during the quarter. We expect steady growth of Activox throughout the year and beyond. Watch this space for future enhancements of our connected COPD offering. We are driving awareness of key clinical studies that have shown improvements in COPD mortality and reductions in COPD hospitalizations such as our home oxygen therapy, home mechanical ventilation study called HOT-HMV. Our market access teams are working to change the standard of care for COPD in key countries around the world to drive future growth in non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator usage and life support ventilation businesses to serve COPD patients. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management models and out-of-hospital software businesses. This quarter Brightree announced the appointment of Robert Dean as General Manager of our home health and hospice business within Brightree. This continues to be a very exciting area for us with lots of long term growth potential. We are expanding out-of-hospital software offerings as we continue to grow and acquire software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We’ve had a tremendous start to the fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond. We are encouraged by the success of our new product launches with the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20 and the ResMed AirMini. We continue to work on a pipeline of new products and enhanced connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and other critical chronic diseases. We have positioned the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020 as we continue to execute our strategy and action, drive operating excellence and pioneer market leading connected care solutions. We have improved our 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to pursue the holy grail of health care improving patients’ quality of life, slowing chronic disease progression and reducing overall health care system costs. With that I will now turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $523.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Taking a closer look at geographic distribution excluding revenue for Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $296.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $189 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas device sales were $157.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $128.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 9%. Masks and other sales were $60.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $38.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. The Brightree results include two small acquisitions we made in our fourth quarter of FY 2017. On an organic basis, Brightree revenue for the quarter grew by 13%. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. And in the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Now, I’ll turn to rest of the P&L. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.4%, lowering our prior year non-GAAP margin predominantly due to ASP declines. On a sequential basis, we saw an increase in gross margin reflecting favorable foreign currency movements and improved product mix from stronger masks sales. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $143.9 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.5% compared to the 27.7% that we reported last year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to progressively improve and to be approximately 26% of revenue by the end of the fiscal year. R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 7.4% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018. Moving further down the P&L. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, consistent with the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $124.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $94.1 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.66, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60. Additionally, foreign exchange movements positively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro largely offset by the stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $94 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $29.6 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.7 million and repaid $60 million of our outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. And as previously announced we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At September 30, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $208 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.5 billion, and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.
Joanne Wuensch: Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Mick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Joanne.
Joanne Wuensch: Excellent, very nice quarter. I have two questions. The first one has to do with adoption of the ResMed AirMini. You are talking about adoption in certain geographies that are more comfortable paying out-of-pocket and I noticed the United States wasn't on the list. Can you discuss how – which regions are more willing to get into [indiscernible] with wonderful product and why not United States?
Mick Farrell: Sure, Joanne. I’ll start and have a go then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead, the Present of our Sleep Business to talk about how we're expanding our AirMini business. Firstly, I'm a personal user of the ResMed AirMini and have been for many months. And I traveled all around the world with it and just in love with it as my new travel companion; literally anywhere I go around the planet it follows me. So that I get my great sleep apnea kit without having to get distilled water at Tokyo at 2’o clock in the morning when I land from the direct flight from San Diego. The adoption of AirMini in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the U.K. where we have established cash pay channels has been very strong in fact far above our early expectations. Patients are really loving paying out-of-pocket for something that has provided such great care. But I’d say in our business to business to consumer markets like the U.S. where we sell to our homecare providers and then they sell cash to patients. It's been a slower ramp up as those customers start to ramp up their cash businesses with all the changes of competitive bidding in the U.S. landscape change, our homecare providers in the U.S. are loving to build their cash businesses and it's something they've been working on strategically for a number of years. And we think the ResMed AirMini along with portable oxygen concentrators is a great opportunity for them and we’re supporting them in both of that. But with that introduction to it, Jim anything further to add for the U.S. or beyond?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, thanks, Mick. I would just add that sales of the AirMini in the U.S. are actually going very well. I think that the comparison intended to Mick’s comments is about on a sort of per patient basis you know where the relative volume of AirMini against the AirSense 10 platform. So the U.S. market, AirMini is performing as expected. We think it's launching well – really well. It will ramp. We’re in a B2B2C model in the U.S. because we're selling it through our channel partners as Mick just spelled out and we see those volumes growing very nicely. It's in the markets where patients are having to pay cash for an AirSense 10 or they choose an AirMini where we're seeing on a proportional basis AirMini is being purchased more frequently.
Joanne Wuensch: And as my follow up question, you spoke about patient volumes for sleep apnea patients being somewhat strong, which is quite the opposite of what we're seeing in other pockets of med tech utilization. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in patient volumes and how you’re measuring that? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for your follow up, Joanne. We don’t go into the details of patient volume growth within geographies. What I can say and the difference maybe between us and other parts of med tech is – this is a very personal experience of suffocation before therapy and then the experience of getting that gift the breath and the life change that can happen with sleep apnea. And taking the U.S. geography with somewhere between 40 million to 60 million Americans suffocating every night and maybe we have six or seven million so far diagnosed and on treatment. We still have 85, 80 plus – 85% plus of the opportunity in front of us. So I think that a large pool of undiagnosed patients provides a regular flow into the sleep labs and into the homecare providers that allows for that sort of steady growth of patients into the channel. We've got a long way to go on that journey. And if you go to other geographies around the world, Western Europe, 85%, 90% of the opportunities still in front in terms of sufferers and getting them through the system. And in our Asia growth markets, the opportunity is above 95%, 98%, 99% in some of the geographies. So we think we’re in mile one of a marathon here and we're really excited about that, patient volume growth continuing to grow steadily not just in this quarter, but throughout the fiscal year that we expect ahead and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. David Stanton from CLSA is online with a question.
David Stanton: Thanks very much and thank you for taking my question. I had a question about replenishment of mask. And I know that you’ve rolled out a new replenishment systems through Brightree. Can you give us some kind of idea about what kind of replenishment growth rates particularly in the U.S. that would be greatly appreciated? Thank you. 
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks, Dave. That's a good question. Clearly through ResMed Resupply which is part of the AirView software solutions package and part of Brightree Connect as we talked about linking on the backend with AirView. We are really working very closely with our homecare providers to make sure that every patient, who wants the mask and is qualified for a mask has the opportunity to get one. As I’m saying earlier I am a personal user of this therapy and you need to change this mask. It's a piece of plastic that touches your face every day and stays on it hopefully for seven hours of sleep every night and even with regular washing and regular drawing the mask needs replacement. And we think there's a lot of opportunity. We know there's a lot of opportunity to work with patients and empower them with the information that they have to be able to access the supplies that they need. So without going specifically into numbers, we can tell you that qualitatively the pool of installed base of customers, patients who are using masks and want to resupply them is increasing quite strongly. And it's a large part of our mask and accessories category.
David Stanton: Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up would be, would it be fair to say that replenishment masks are growing as strong or less strong than new masks?
Mick Farrell: So, David, we probably don't want to go into the specifics of each category of masks, the installed base and new patient flow and how quickly they’re growing. But if you think about it from sort of a mathematics point of view as the installed base grows larger and larger and we work on replenishment protocols with patients and expand them, there's some linear opportunities with new patient setup and some exponential opportunities with replenishment as you engage the patients throughout the world in all sorts of different models.
David Stanton: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Operator: Steve Wheen from JPMorgan is online with a question. I apologize Steve Wheen is from Evans and Partners.
Steve Wheen: Yes, hello. Can you hear me?
Mick Farrell: Got you loud and clear, Steve. And I am glad we’ve got your company right too.
Steve Wheen: No, no, that other one. Anyway I just had a question just on the revenue for mask. Obviously, a very nice step-up in mask growth and it follows the fourth quarter where there was a bit of hiatus just because of capacity. Is this an unusual growth rate that we’re seeing in this quarter in terms of catch up and therefore it might moderate going forward? Or how do you see the appetite for these new masks, now that there is no restrictions oversupply.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Steve, as we have talked about 90 days ago, we did 90 days ago still have some supply constraints that we were just leaving at the end of Q4 throughout Q1 we were supply unconstrained. And we were able to meet and beat the very fast demand as you saw for masks throughout the world. And if you look at the masks and accessories category, it grew at 13% on a constant currency basis in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and it grew at 15% on a constant currency basis in Europe and Asian countries. Look, we think that that we can continue to grow masks all the way throughout the fiscal year. There were all sorts of different changes that happen in terms of comparables from quarter X and quarter Y as you go through out of fiscal year. But as you think about the next twelve months and twenty four months, we think the runway of the F20, the AirFit F20, the AirFit N20, so the full phase and the nasal components are very strong. And we're just out of the gate with the AirTouch F20, which is our brand new technology which incorporates both the LSR, or liquid silicon rubber, but also foam technology. And it's early days, but patients are really loving that opportunity. And so we're working with our channel partners on the business side of it. But in terms of patient acceptance, we’re seeing some really good patient acceptance. So having said all that, I think we've got a really good runway ahead for growth throughout fiscal 2018 for our masks. I don't think it's a catch up. I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond.
Steve Wheen: Great. And then just on life follow up question. On the SG&A side, I wonder if Brett you might be able to give us some color as to the major drivers of that tailing off as a percentage of revenue by the end of the year. What's driving that? Is it legal costs related? Yes, if you could just give us some color as to what the major – what’s underpinning that?
Brett Sandercock:
,:
Steve Wheen: So there would be specifically a reduction in legal costs within that number.
Brett Sandercock: I not let that, I mean, you can’t – that’s a difficult one to predict. I wouldn’t say that I’d say you kind of – it builds more, let’s say builds more into the run rate so to speak.
Steve Wheen: Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Operator: David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.
David Low: Thanks very much. Could I just start with Brett your comment with when you talk on gross margins about some ASP pressure, let’s see if you could talk a little bit anything in particular that showing up in this quarter that [indiscernible] different from what we’ve seen in the past.
Brett Sandercock: I mean not particularly, David, we – you see every year in and year out. You see ASP the content impacting your gross margin. So I guess it’s just to call out of the main impact on gross margin year-on-year. If I look at it sequentially, it looked actually pretty good and we’re quite pleased with that uptick there on the margin. So, no, I wouldn’t say it’s adjusting unusually met and it’s kind of more typical with what we experienced in terms of SSP declines.
David Low: Okay, great, thanks. And if I could just touch on the oxygen concentrator, the Activox, could you talk a little bit about where you think that product is positioned versus the competition? It’s been a fast growing space. You see something that now becomes a material contributor quite quickly or is that something that’s slightly to grow gradually over time?
Mick Farrell: Look, yeah, David, as I said in the prepared remarks, we just relaunched with the quality and new capability in systems around our Activox system as we’ve now incorporated that acquisition of Inova into our business and relaunched it really with our sales team this quarter. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to maybe provide some further detail on our POC business.
Rob Douglas: Sure, David. We described some of the quality improvements that’s really under the hood quality improvement. So, we’re very happy with those quality improvements and how they’re going and our customers let’s say use the product will start to experience those improvements. The product positioned us very portable. It's got the longest battery life. It’s very light weight. It’s a good performer. And we see steady take up of it. And we’re patient with this product and we're going to make sure it has really the ResMed quality, and provides really good treatment to patients and we’ll build on that.
David Low: Thanks.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.
Margaret Kaczor: Good morning Brett. Good afternoon everyone else. First question for me is on the generator growth this quarter, which remained quite strong in the Americas. So maybe you guys can give us a little bit more detail around what's driving the strength. You've been keeping in this high single-digit range. Is it existing accounts increasing their mix of the resonate platform, given all of the new software offerings, just underlying patient volume? Any additional color would be great. Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks for the question Margaret. And yes, we did see strong growth in Q1. If you take the U.S., Canada Latin America countries combined we saw 8% constant currency growth in Q1, and across the Europe and Asia countries, we saw 9% constant currency growth. Look, we think the total market is growing in that mid-to-high single digits across the sleep market with devices sort of more towards the mid-single digits and masks toward the high-single digits. Implying in Q1 that we did take share within the device and mask categories, and we believe that to be true. Of course, we don't go into detail around that. But some of the reasons behind that are certainly all boats are floating on the strong patient growth that we talked about earlier, but we are taking share. And I think the share is as you've seen now, it's 36 months since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions platform. And it's really a solution when you combine it together. We've published data now in the peer-reviewed press that shows that we can reduce labor costs for our home care provider customers by up to 59%. So when you have a system that can lower labor cost for your customers by 59%, it can really help them to start to say not only will I try this device and try this software, but I'll double down on it, and I’ll continue to invest in it. And we're seeing a lot of customers garner a lot of profit growth for themselves that they didn't take that cash and reinvest in the business for better patient care. So we think this is really a win for ResMed. Obviously, as you see in these numbers. It's a win for our home care customers that use ResMed, and it's a win for the patients because they get better care. They engage daily sometimes with their myAir app and check out their myAir score and their adherence rates move from 50%, 60% historically in this industry up to 87% in one of our published studies and beyond that in some of our unpublished work. So we think it is sustainable, strong value proposition with our customers that's driving it, Margaret.
Margaret Kaczor: Great. And then on the breakthrough side as a follow-up. That one is chugging along as well, you’ve got this low to mid-teens, and I know some of that is the acquisitions, but how should we think about acquisitions being off for the rest of the Brightree installed base? Can those be material to your growth? And then just as you think about that underlying growth, is it new accounts? Or again those existing accounts just choosing and selecting more new offerings that you have? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. So another good question, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Brightree growth was 13% constant currency if you didn't include any of the tuck-in acquisitions, and it's 15% constant currency, including the modest tuck-in acquisitions that we did throughout the year AllCall and so on into Brightree. Look, yes, solid, low to mid-teen growth in our software-as-a-service business. We think that some of that is new accounts. Our sales team at Brightree is excellent. [Audio Gap] and I and a bunch of the team, Raj went out there to Atlanta to spend time with the team and in a leadership program and looking at those top not just sales but development leaders and how they're teaming up and really adapting the ResMed culture but keeping a strong Brightree software-as-a-service culture and driving a really strong commercial performance. And so we think that's sustainable, taking into account share but also growing users within existing accounts. We find that the HME providers who partnered with Brightree grow, and as they grow, they get more users. And software-as-a-service system users is paid on a per basis. So you can grow by getting new accounts. You can also grow by helping new customers grow. So we're doing both.
Margaret Kaczor: Great thanks.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. 
Sean Laaman: Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just back on Activox, Mick. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more granularity on sort of specifically the relaunch and what you might have changed from what you're doing before to what you're doing with the relaunch, that would be really good.
Mick Farrell: Yes I’ll hand it over to Rob.
Rob Douglas: Yes, Sean. As I said before, we – ResMed's position in the markets are very high-tech, high-quality value and innovation. As we got our early experience with the Activox, we saw a number of improvements that we wanted to make, and we made those improvements. I described them earlier as improvements under the hood. So they're really – they're not features, but they're improving the delivery of the existing features. And as I say we progressively incremented them in a sequential basis, and then we really looking to the absolute measure, which is our customers' response to those to see how we go – to see to really put the metrics around the quality improvements and what extra value that adds. And I can't really get granular on the exact next steps of improvements that we're coming up simply because we don't forecast our R&D programs for competitive reasons, but I would say we've got a very strong team working on it. We've got some great ideas. We still got the feature that we have talked about, about adding some of our connected care capability into the system, which we believe will further improve the quality of delivery of oxygen treatment of patients but also improve the ability of our HME customers to manage those patients and those fleets of devices that they need to. And that's all work in progress.
Sean Laaman: Thanks Rob, thanks Mick. And may be just a quick follow-up for Bret. Are you able to give us a sense of what currency you might be thinking going forward for the euro and the Aussie?
Brett Sandercock: [Indiscernible] this morning they changed for me already, but when I was looking at that we're sort of – we were being forecasting around that sort of $0.78 to $0.79 of the U.S. and around $1.18 on the euro, euro U.S. they're moving around quite a bit of volatility. So yes, on that one, Sean, but that's sort of what we're using as being current rates at the time we looked at it a few days ago.
Sean Laaman: Great. That’s all I had. Thank you everybody.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning guys. Brett, can I start with a quick question on gross margin just to clarify or confirm your comments regarding the outlook for gross margin of the remainder of fiscal 2018. Did you say it should be consistent with 1Q 2018 as a result? 
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I said broadly consistent.
Saul Hadassin: And I just wonder if you can give us some of the contributing points to that considering the mix seems to be improving on the mask side and just cognitive of what currency is doing. But is there anything else presumably, you've got some efficiencies coming through manufacturing so what's maybe offsetting the incremental improvement in gross margin over the fiscal year?
Brett Sandercock: Sure. We saw – well, and I'll just we did see some incremental improvement from Q4 and Q1. And we did see certainly you can see some improvement in product mix, and that's been a turnaround for us. And the expectation is that will be more a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind over the last few years that’s positive on that. And there's number of factors playing out on ASP decline, FX, manufacturing procurement efficiencies, and so on, which we do expect to get over the course of the year. But the product mix and how we're looking, I guess, the portfolio a little more diversified now as well. So that plays into looking at predict on gross margin as well. So I think all in the mix. I guess the other thing I would say is that stronger Aussie on a sequential basis kind of hurt us going into Q2 and essentially a factor that in as well. So that would be headwind for us going sequentially selects inclusive of that. So some of the other underlying trends I think are there in a positive but there could be few going against us, particularly on the FX next quarter. But broadly consistent, I guess, what we're saying is we're comfortable with that margin around where it's at, and we're seeing good growth across both devices and mask, which I think is really showing the strength of the business and a good diversified portfolio. So I think it's going to – with that sales growth and good gross profit dollars, and I think that's in good shape for us going forward.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks Brett. That’s all I had.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks for taking my questions. Just in the U.S. instant card consolidation with DMEs over the last few years. Just try and give us a sense of what you seem pressure on prices, I guess, the business under the hands of larger buyers.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question Andrew. Clearly, over the last three, to five years, there has been some consolidation in our U.S. home care provider base, still around 5000-plus home medical equipment providers in the U.S. So quite a large and diverse group of local mom-and-pop, regionals as well as national players, and we partner with people across that spectrum. As I look at the market, I think we see a relative sampling of changes in reimbursement, some of those big step changes that happen in the early phases of the U.S. government CMS program to get in line with our private payers and now we have a sort of steady program going forward. And I think a pretty broad view at CMS that actually investing in sleep apnea care reduces long-term costs for the government, and we're certainly as I said on the AdvaMed Board of Directors, we definitely spend time in Washington letting Washington know that medical devices as an industry is able to lower long-term costs by keeping patients, particularly in sleep apnea and in COPD, out of hospital and under better care. So we're seeing a pretty steady reimbursement environment. It does have reductions, but they're reasonably steady. So I think we're able to weather that and work with our home care providers to make sure that they use Brightree and they use AirView, and they can lower their labor cost by 50%, 60%, and that's the way to free up cash to reinvest in marketing to primary care doctors and going after the 40 million, 50 million, 60 million people who are suffocating. And as yet haven't had a chance to get diagnosed, get treated and get a better quality of life.
Andrew Goodsall: And Rob may be just to you as my follow-up question. I guess just in terms of your proposition, which is, I guess, potentially higher price mask relative to some of the competition, but I guess a bit of a longer-term recurring revenue line. I’m just trying to understand how that's going with the better sales propositions going with the DMEs in terms of them taking through the benefits of that program versus perhaps just going for margin or sorry, low pricing to increase margin initially.
Mick Farrell: Yes thanks Andrew. I’ll handle that follow-up to Jim Hollingshead, our President of Global Sleep business.
Jim Hollingshead: Andrew I think on your first question we still see consolidation in the market, but it's nothing of out trend right. I mean, there's been no unusual change in consolidation in the U.S. market as Mick said remains very fragments where you get right down to it, right? 5,500 roughly providers of sleep. What we're seeing is that HME customers more and more are realizing how important it is to them and their business to resupply patients. And so we have seen the scheme up a little bit earlier the call. We have an on ongoing increase in adoption of resupply platforms. And our offerings, especially through Brightree, have made that a lot easier for our customers. And so as they adopt those more automated approaches to resupply, they're able to grow that side of their business.
Andrew Goodsall: That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.
Matt Taylor: Hi thanks for taking the question. Can you hear that?
Brett Sandercock: Got you loud and clear Matt.
Matt Taylor: Great. So Brett, I did have one follow-up on the gross margin. You had talked in the past about mix being the biggest factor. So I was still a little bit surprised that we didn't see more of a lift this quarter. Can you just talk about the rest of the year, what you're expecting from effect on gross margin? And is it mainly the Aussie dollar that's holding it back from being better with this better mix?
Brett Sandercock: Sure, Matt. I mean, I guess, you should have asked that back a little while, I guess you've got to put a little bit of context a few years ago when we're seeing what you are experiencing like huge growth rates in devices. So we're talking 30%, 40%, almost 50%. So the differential between the device growth and mask growth was very substantial back then. So that did have a bit of impact on product mix. So we're still seeing that impact, but obviously, can be more modest when differential is perhaps more like 5%. So I mean, part of it is, if you like, the resilience and the strength of the device that we're seeing, which is a very good thing. So therefore, the thing. So therefore, the product mix, I guess, is more modest than what you might have seen two years ago, which makes sense. And the other thing I'd add to that is if you looked at you go back to FY’14, masks were probably something like, matching other categories something like 46% of our revenue. You fast-forward to today is about 38%. So there has kind of been that kind of overall change in our mix as well. So that plays into it as well. But – so it's still there the trends there the improved product mix is there, but it's on a more modest scale than what you might have seen when devices were growing really strongly back in FY’15.
Matt Taylor: Thanks. And your continued device growth a couple of years after the AirSense launch has been impressive. And I guess, I was wondering if you thought you continue to grow at kind of above-market rates with just the base AirSense. And if you could comment on how material you think of oxygen concentrators and the Mini can be.
Brett Sandercock: Yes that’s a great question Matt. I’ll turn try with that. Look, if you think about it, the portfolio of devices we have is a lot broader now. Brett's talking about the change of connected care and our sort of leadership in connected care, not only within our vertical, sleep apnea, COPD, but across the med tech sector has launched us to the No. 1 position in devices in flow generators, and that's a large ballast in the boat to Brett's point much higher percentage of our portfolio. So GM percentage lines move less strongly although gross profit dollars and net operating profit as you saw this quarter growing at 12% year-on-year in OP is really solid growth and that's free cash flow. And we invest free cash flow cash back into our business. We don't invest percentages back into our business, and so we manage on the growth of that. But our continued device growth will expand, and I think you can add on sort of strong, steady maintenance and growth of share. But more importantly growth of patients into the funnel to keep device growth strong and steady. And as you said, there's upside as you add on to ResMed AirMini, which is brand-new category. It's cash pay. It's a second use, it's travel path, and it's sold direct in some markets. It's sold through our great home care provider customers in the U.S. and many European countries, and we think that's good addition. As you said, there's portable oxygen concentrators, and there's also our growing COPD play in noninvasive ventilation and life-support ventilation, and we have now cloud connected both of those, the NIV. So our AirCurve 10 range and our Astral devices both now have cloud connectivity. We're in the early days of driving our connected COPD strategy, but that's a very high-cost disease state. It’s The number three killer in the world, COPD. And it's the number two cause for rehospitalization. So we think as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, there's a lot of opportunity to have steady and growing device growth as we look forward to the longer term
Matt Taylor: Thanks.
Operator: Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes hi, it’s [indiscernible]. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the COPD and also as it relates to the device growth overall. So just as we look forward, do you think RSA itself can continue to grow mid-single digits? And then the COPD part of them, if you like, is on top of device growth given we're relatively early in the journey there? Or how does that sort of play out long term? And then all also perhaps you could talk to where do you think we are in terms of capturing the value out of the noninvasive vent side, you talked about Europe side.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks, Victor [ph]. The answer is yes. I mean, I think the sleep apnea market as we said earlier is growing in mid-to-high single digits with the devices more in that mid-single-digit range. I think we can continue to hold and grow share in the device side that will allow us to grow the sleep apnea business and that mid-single digits in the device category. And in addition to the ResMed AirMini, which is on top of that as a cash pay and the POCs, which is on top of that, there are the noninvasive ventilator devices. Where we're at on that is the early stages. There are 400 million, 500 million patients worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive preliminary disease or lung disease. Many of them remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Many of them need to get first initial drug therapy, and they need oxygen therapy and then they need non-invasive ventilation therapy. And then as their disease progresses towards more chronic care, they need life-support ventilation therapy. And so ResMed plans to be walking with those COPD patients along that channel. So this is a longer-term development. It's sort of part of our 2020 and even our 2020 strategies. We're starting to put that together and developing our connected COPD strategy, and we'll be doing that with partners across med tech and pharma and beyond. And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software. And if you put them all together, I think you've got a very strong and dynamic portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the cash pay at kind of CPAP side that it seems that’s going better in the market ofAustralia in stage? Is that cannibalizing mainly in cash pay market with us cannibalizing sales? Or how much is there [indiscernible]?
Mick Farrell: Yes I’ll hand that to Rob.
Rob Douglas: So our view of the market whole new segment, and so it's contributing to growth. And when a person buys an AirMini to travel in addition to their home sleep app, that's really good for them and to sell that we otherwise wouldn’t have had. So we see a very strongly contributing to growth. As Jim said earlier in some of the cash pay markets, there are some people will say actually I will not use that, it’s my premium one. We’re okay with that either way. But really on as a whole in most of the markets AirMini is really a strong contributor.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with a question.
Anthony Petrone: Good afternoon good morning thank you for taking the question. Maybe make a little bit on rising tide carrying all boats here Philips put up a pretty good print as well high single digit growth. So many a little bit more on is it a reimbursement thing that that benefiting everyone in the marketplace? Is it another dynamic that whether it's in a DME channel or again you also mentioned reimbursement coverage in France. Just trying to get maybe why this quarter's a little bit different from an underlying funnel/volume perspective.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes, look, I think there is some rising tide there, and that's a global mid-single digits to high-single digits market growth. And so other players are going in that mid- to high single digit range as well. As I said earlier, I do think we're taking share with connected care. You mentioned France. There is four levels of reimbursement for sleep apnea therapy that starts from January 1 in France. And the highest is telemonitored patients with adherence over 4 hours and telemonitored patients with two to four hours and then below that non-telemonitored patients, and so on. And ResMed's been leading in connected care not just in the U.S. but globally, and we've been preparing for this type of a change, and we're really excited that the government of France has recognized that they get a return on investment by telemonitoring patients, increasing adherence and taking those patients out of hospital. So we think this market is great and growing and good for all players, but we think it's particularly good for people who are looking at ways to take cost out of that channel and partner with their customers, which include the home care providers but also the patients like giving them their own data every day patients use their devices more. I mean, adherence rates of 87% is unheard of in our industry, and we're publishing that and getting it in the peer-reviewed press in the Blue Journal, Jama, Lancet and you're going to see more from us on that. We have one billion nights of sleep data in the identified aggregated data, and we're going to be putting clinical studies out there to show this therapy, sleep apnea therapy is very beneficial, and we'll be doing the same in COPD as we move forward.
Anthony Petrone: Great and then just a follow-up would be just a bit on working capital once again, just on year-over-year basis. AARs ticked up quite a bit as inventory. I'm just wondering is there reason to hold more inventory? Is there an elongated sales cycle in the same on the credit sales? And is there an elongated cycle there as well? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: So I’ll handle the question to Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks Mick. Thanks Anthony Petrone. On the data side, [indiscernible] I think is still within kind of our range that we would expect and fairly typically historically, and it's probably still may be allow us maybe 12 months ago but still comfortable with where we are on that. On the inventory front, you're right. We're up a little on the inventory, but it's been pretty well documented. We're a little bit supply constrained on masks and so on. So some of that is kind of a rebuild into getting that right. So you see that's kind of manifested in the inventory a little bit as well. That's all the way through the supply chain. So we're now in much better shape, but I guess that's reflected in some inventory build. And then going forward, I'd expect not necessarily come down, but I'd expect sort of the growth with moderate as we kind of balance a bit better now.
Anthony Petrone: Thanks.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the more than 6,000-strong ResMed team for their execution on our new product launches. This quarter, that hard work has translated into market share gains, revenue growth and double-digit 12% net operating profit growth. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, including patients, physicians, payers and providers. We will talk to you again in 90 days. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect. This concludes ResMed’s first quarter of fiscal year 2018 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. For the call today, I will review top level financial results. I will then review some geographic highlights and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. We achieved solid high single-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales of our sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. At the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share was $0.77. We have passed the one-year mark since the closing of our Brightree acquisition. That acquisition has been a significant success for homecare customers, for patients and for shareholders. This quarter, we acquired new capabilities and technologies to add to our Brightree offering with two tuck-in acquisitions that I will go into further detail on later on in the call. We're making great progress with Brightree as we expand our connected care offering for all of our customers, lowering costs and freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested for even better patient care. I'll discuss more details of our digital health and connected care strategy later in my remarks. We have refined our operating model at ResMed to ensure a direct line from customer insights through upstream marketing through our product and solution development teams and also a direct line back down to the sales interface within each of our vertical businesses. You can think of this as a merging of what were regional sales structures into global business units. We now have a global sleep business vertical, a global respiratory care business vertical and a global Software-as-a-Service business vertical. We have also maintained a direct line from Rob and me to our Asia growth markets business and our Germany healthcare business due to the unique go-to-market models of these two businesses. With this refined operating model, we will not only improve our innovation generation capability, we will also be able to scale more efficiently and provide better SG&A leverage, as we grow towards our 2020 financial and strategic goals. Now, for some geographic highlights of the business. The Americas sales teams achieved solid revenue growth at 8% year-on-year, or 6% excluding Brightree. These results were fueled by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume is growing steadily. We launched the world's smallest CPAP, which is now my favorite business travel companion, called the AirMini. Since its launch around mid-May, the AirMini is achieving good early adoption in its product category of small, second-use, travel-friendly, cash-pay CPAP and APAP devices. I'll talk about AirMini in more detail a little later. Growth in devices in the Americas geography was a solid 8% for the quarter. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find value from AirView software and our fast-growing patient engagement app called myAir. We now have over 5 million patients in AirView and over 3 million patients monitored daily with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms in the U.S., led by the Astral cloud-connected life-support ventilator. The masks and accessories category grew 4% in the Americas geography this quarter. As we noted on our call 90 days ago, we expected to have mask supply constraints throughout the first half of the quarter and to get our manufacturing sufficiently ramped up so that we would be ahead of demand and have supply ahead of demand by June. We did just that. However, we clearly missed out on some perishable mask sales of product in April and May, while the N20 and F20 were in limited availability. Now, we have supply solidified and we can instill importantly full confidence in our sales force that when they make a sale, we can deliver the N20 and F20 products to fulfill that commitment. We are now set to increase sales growth in masks for FY 2018, as we unleash our sales force with these excellent products and full supply. In terms of customer feedback on the N20 and F20, it remains very positive. The 97% plus fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal technology provide a very long runway of growth throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our European and Asia geographies. Device sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 11% this quarter on a constant currency basis. Growth was particularly strong in France, the UK, Japan as well as Australia, New Zealand. It is worth noting that reimbursement for telemonitoring has been approved now in France. This has provided and will provide on an ongoing basis increased adoption of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms. Digital health and connected care are going global, and ResMed is a catalyst for that. We have had excellent success with connected care value creation for our U.S. customers these last three-plus years, and we expect to continue that. But now we also expect to provide similar value creation from connected care for our customers in Europe and across Asia Pacific as we expand this offering. We also achieved solid growth in our dental business in Europe with the Narval mandibular repositioning device. Masks and accessories grew at 4% this quarter in combined Europe and Asia geographies. Similar to the U.S. commentary, we expect this growth to expand in FY 2018 based on the positive feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers. Customers in Europe and Asia are also excited by the broad fit range and enhanced comfort of the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we're making significant advances with the smallest, the quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care. We launched our new AirTouch full face mask in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The AirTouch UltraSoft memory foam cushion is a breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea. AirTouch is the softest CPAP mask in ResMed's history. It is a significant innovation that is truly novel and very patient-friendly. This mask addresses the number one reason that patients quit CPAP therapy, which is comfort. The UltraSoft memory foam is permeable, allowing heat and moisture to escape without compromising therapy pressure. The AirTouch foam mask cushion also fits into the AirFit F20 frame, giving our homecare customers interchange and switch options as they fit patients and help patients better adhere to CPAP therapy. As we discussed earlier, we started shipping the world's smallest CPAP midway through May. It is still very early days, but we have had excellent initial demand for the AirMini and we are expanding and leading in this new niche product category. There is solid demand for a category of small travel-friendly, second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. You will hear more from us as we build this category and drive growth with AirMini. We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. This quarter, we announced two tuck-in acquisitions within the Brightree product portfolio that enhance existing Brightree modules and address customer pain points for order intake and opportunities in resupply. The first acquisition of a technology called Conduit Office is the technology behind a Brightree module called MyForms. This technology will allow us to enhance MyForms as a leading documentation and workflow management solution. MyForms provides automation to help improve the order intake process of our homecare customers. The net result is reduced claim denials and improved audit outcomes for our homecare customers. The second tuck-in acquisition is a company called AllCall Connect. This acquisition provides a full-featured live call center for homecare customers who subscribed to Brightree Connect, one of our resupply offerings. It can be expensive and sometimes inefficient for homecare customers to develop their own in-house live calling resupply capability. However, we know from our research that regular CPAP mask and accessory replacement are critical to ensure ongoing patient comfort, fit and adherence to CPAP therapy. AllCall Connect allows us to provide this service to our customers. On the big data to actionable information fronts, a new study was presented at the American Thoracic Society Conference in May. This ResMed-sponsored study of over 130,000 patients on PAP therapy showed that patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, or CSA, are two times more likely to terminate therapy. This study highlights the importance of monitoring patients to support adherence. Also, it shows that early diagnosis of CSA and use of therapy such as ResMed's ASV technology may minimize risk of therapy non-adherence. The de-identified aggregated propensity matched data in the study leverage the more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our connected care digital health ecosystem. With our new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Carlos Nunez, partnering with global teams of researchers in digital health, we predict that the insights gained from studies like this and beyond will provide the opportunity for ResMed and our partners to advance the field of sleep medicine faster than ever before. Moving to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators and life-support ventilators continue to grow globally, and we continue to develop our connected care strategy within COPD. The Journal of Global Health estimates that there are over 380 million patients worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. With COPD being the number three cause of death and the number two cause for re-hospitalization, we are focused on testing and driving models that lower costs and improve outcomes for COPD patients. This is an urgent need to address a growing public health crisis. On the clinical front, a study using a combination of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation, a study known as HOT-HMV was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, or JAMA. This ResMed-sponsored study was presented at the American Thoracic Society in May was previously presented at ERS. The conclusion of the study is that patients who receive non-invasive ventilation at home, in addition to oxygen therapy at home, had a 51% decrease in the risk of re-hospitalization or death. This major finding is now published in a peer-reviewed press and a top tier journal. This is an important milestone. HOT-HMV contributes to a growing body of evidence, supporting the broader use of non-invasive ventilation, such as ResMed's AirCurve 10 platform as an important treatment for patients with COPD. We are excited that we now have our global respiratory care business vertical, including direct line of sight from management down to the sales interface. This augers well for better leverage of studies like HOT-HMV to drive the changes in standard of care and drive further growth of non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator and life support ventilation businesses. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service business models. We are working with payers and providers to develop and enhance chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination models as well as to acquire and grow Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice verticals. We made progress during the quarter in this area with Brightree's new offering for the home health and hospice market. Our solution called OASIS, which stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set. This is an integrated software and service solution with Brightree's coding and billing service that helps home health and hospice agencies reduce errors, improve patient care and optimize reimbursement, saving time so that they can focus on patients. This continues to be an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our software offerings. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about our new product launches this last fiscal year and during the quarter with the N20, the F20, AirTouch full face masks, and world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. We are well positioned for fiscal year 2018 and we continue to work on a pipeline of new products and connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other clinical adjacencies. We are positioning the company for long-term growth for 2020 and well beyond, as we refine our operating model, better enabling customer insights to power our product and service solutions teams developments and then drive even better sales execution. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefits of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks, and we will go to Q&A after that. Over to you, Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $556.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $314 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $206.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $174.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $139.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific device sales were $145.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $61.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9% while masks and other increased by 4% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low double-digits. During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP numbers in the current quarter adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. In the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, Brightree onetime deferred revenue fair value adjustment, SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, consistent on a year-over-year basis. This reflects manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, offset by declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2017 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% compared to the 25.8% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to improve from around 27% at the beginning of the fiscal year to around 26% by the end of the fiscal year. R&D expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6%, consistent with the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $900,000 over the prior year. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $139.1 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $109.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.77, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.8% and for the fiscal year 2017, it was 20%.The current quarter effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $2.2 million (23:03) share-based payment transactions recorded in accordance with Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the vicinity of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $140.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and only a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $28.2 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, an increase of 6% over the previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. However, we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At June 30, we have $1.1 billion in gross debt and $257 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.
Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is actually Scott on for Margaret. I wanted to start on the U.S. market growth for both devices and masks. Mick, should we look at device growth on a six-month basis or is underlying device growth accelerating in the U.S.? And then on masks, how do that underlying market growth compare to last quarter and Q4?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Scott. In terms of market growth, look, I think it's always good to look at a 6-month or even 12-month trailing period because there's lots of sort of fluctuations that could happen on a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted and aspects of how the market might turn. In general, we look at the market as mid to high single-digits growth for the market and devices are at the low end of that range and masks are at the high end of that range. At ResMed, we like to not just meet, but beat market growth rates and I'd say if you look at this quarter completely we beat market growth rates with our device growth, and we're a little behind it on our mask growth rate given some of the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. But the market growth rate I think it is good to look at a 6 or 12-month trailing period to sort of get a better picture of what the market growth is.
Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then, Brett, I wanted to ask on gross margin in the quarter and then the puts and takes for that number in terms of currency and mix and pricing and you guys guided to a gross margin for the next fiscal year to be consistent with this quarter. The same kind of question in terms of headwinds and tailwinds concerning you guys have probably had a pretty strong mask growth rate throughout the year.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Well, as you said, Scott, lots of puts and takes on that. But, I guess, the margins if you look at our last few quarters is relatively stable in that sense and we're seeing certainly sort of moderation and that product mix impact is still there, a little bit negative. We had really strong device growth. So, obviously, if device is growing more strongly than mask, then you have a slightly negative impact on margins. But to the extent we see some improvement in that mask growth for FY 2018 then that would certainly be supportive of product mix and supportive of the gross margin.
Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then lastly for Mick, kind of a bigger picture question on AirMini. Could this potentially be something you push as more of a mainstream product or something you would consider investing DTC advertising dollars towards or are you guys just going to rely on kind of your traditional customers to promote the product themselves? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott. Look, the AirMini is a really exciting product and it's the world's smallest CPAP, but it is designed to be a second-use, cash-pay, travel-friendly device, and that's sort of the niche segment, category, if you like, that it's creating and growing and leading. We've seen great initial demand in the U.S. through our home care channel, as they get the opportunity to enhance their cash sales and in markets around the world where there are other go-to-market models, patients are willing to pay out of pocket. And I think there was some good pent-up demand for a travel-friendly CPAP like this and we look forward to expanding that niche category to a larger niche and continuing to lead it and the AirMini technology is doing a great job now.
Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just to re-ask the question, Brett, on gross margin. If the masks are as good as what the feedback suggests, I'm not really sure why we don't really see a meaningful tick up in mask growth and, therefore, why wouldn't we see some upward pressure on gross margin?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well, really, in that sense, we (29:30) and, I guess, what I'm saying at the moment, it's broadly consistent. We're still seeing some pretty good device growth. Again, we expect to see better growth in masks than what we saw this quarter. And to the extent we see that coming through then I'll update gross margin guidance in a dynamic way. So we'll still continue to update as we go and it's the same story. If we get, say, acceleration in mask then you will see some improvement in gross margin. But we're still doing pretty well in devices also. And year-on-year, we had a few – if you look at that with the FX and things like that year-on-year, it was a little bit of headwind for us as well. So, there's few things playing out on that but the thesis still hold. If we get good mask growth then you'll see an improvement in product mix and improvement in gross margin.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Sure. Great, Brett, and thanks for taking my question. That's all I have. Appreciate it.
Operator: As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, feel free to re-enter the queue. David Low from JPMorgan is on line with a question.
David A. Low - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. If we could just touch on the device growth. As you say, there is a good strong results there. Just wondering if you could give us some sense as the what sort of contribution you saw from the non-invasive ventilation line, if it was that growing strongly and was the AirMini device much of a contributor to that line, please?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Hi, David. It's Mick here. As you know, we don't split out respiratory care device growth versus sleep device growth at this point. But, look, what I can say qualitatively is that the vast majority of that growth was the sleep apnea device growth powered by the AirView software solution and uptake of the great value for physicians and providers from AirView. But that is as we move connected care to our respiratory care platform, that is starting to get some momentum there. I will say that AirMini coming out the gates was relatively minimal on its impact on the aggregate device growth because that niche is really just starting up, but there was some balance between sleep apnea and respiratory care growth, but heavily weighted towards sleep apnea device growth, particularly in the U.S. region in terms of the year-on-year growth rate.
David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks. And sorry, just a related question. The French change, the telemonitoring, was that meaningful in this quarter or is that something that's likely to become more of a contributor going forward?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, it's more of an ongoing contributor. It will have some influence on product selection by customers as they are looking to make purchases during those 90 days, but that changes – something that is actually changing the fundamental basis of competition, if you like, in the industry in France and it's an ongoing opportunity for us to drive AirSense, AirCurve, and really the whole Air Solutions ecosystem, particularly the software side of AirView and we're seeing the French physicians really embracing the technology and we're seeing French customers really liking the efficiencies that they can get from the technology. And we're looking forward to patients getting the ability in France to get access to myAir data and at the same levels that the patients throughout the U.S. have these last three or four years and we think the value across that whole ecosystem of customers will be strong. So the short answer is, it's an ongoing thing and it did impact a little bit in the quarter, but it'll be ongoing for FY 2018 and beyond.
David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I would check regarding just the Brightree commentary in terms of growth. If I go back to the 4Q 2016 period and just look at the revenues there, it looks like the implied growth was about 25% this quarter. Can you just clarify whether that was the case and was there any contribution from some of those tuck-in acquisitions you made? Thanks.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Saul, that's rightly said. It was a little bit complicated last year with the fair value adjustments that we had from Brightree around the acquisition and on revenue side. And I see it like it was a slightly shorter quarter. So what I've done in – what I said for that is really an underlying prudent comparable growth rate. If you look at like-for-like just on the numbers that we've got in our filings, for example, you're exactly right, it's around that 25%. But if you look at it on a pure comparable basis so I would try to (34:20) strip out some of those sort of adjustments then we're looking at that pretty solid low double-digit growth.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks, Brett. And can I just ask one additional question about the impact of currency for fiscal 2018 on gross margin in terms of the way currency stands at the moment, is there a net benefit coming through this fiscal year based on what the euro has done versus the USD, or is that effectively offset by the rise in the Aussie dollar on the COGS side? Thanks.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, you're right. If I have a look – just to give you a sense for it, if I look at – currencies are moving around a lot lately as you'd be aware. But if I look at it going into – sequentially going into Q1, then I think we get a benefit of some currency for that at the moment, I think we're looking to get a benefit of maybe sort of that 20 to 30 basis points. But then if I take it into Q2 where we then start to pick up some of the impact from the appreciating Aussie dollar, it basically reverses that, so basically roughly 40 basis point reversal. That's a little bit of a tailwind sequentially going in Q1 that then turns into a small headwind into Q2. And then going forward, that should then just sort of flatten out. But if you look at it sequentially that impact is better in Q1, but then a worse impact in Q2 for us. And that's really driven off that pretty sharp increase in the Aussie dollar, which just happened quite recently. And then we'll see where that heads. But at the moment, that's the impacts that we're looking at.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: That's great. Thanks very much, Brett.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good evening. Can you hear me okay?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: We can hear you fine, Joanne.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Two questions. The first one is it's great to hear that you're out of supply constraint on the masks and the accessories or the two new mask items. Can you give us an idea of where do you go from here with full supply? What kind of demand that you're seeing for those products?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think the demand is high and physicians like it because of its broad fit range. Technicians like it because – most importantly, patients like it. And it has a good first-time fit ratio and a very broad fit range of 97%, one of them 99% on the other. And the InfinitySeal comfort technology just having very light levels of plastic around the bridge of the nose is very comfortable for patients. So, yeah, we missed some perishable sales in the first half of the quarter due to supply constraints. That goes away in Q1, right. As we look forward to FY 2018, our sales force confidence will really be there and I think that's a product that you shouldn't underestimate that when salespeople are in short supply, they don't sell that product line. And when they aren't short-supplied, they can sell that product line. So, as we look forward to FY 2018, we think there will be some very good success of the N20 and F20 and really happy to let that sales team do what they do best, which is provide (37:38) customers in a way that they can help give it to their customers or (37:41) the patients.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is there a way to quantify those lost perishable sales?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: There are probably 20 different models that we have internally. But it's not something we talk about externally. It's certainly something that – as we said 90 days ago, we never like to be under supply constraints. With innovation, new technologies, new plastics, new ways of designing single cushion masks that revolutionize the market, we had some challenges with the technology there last quarter. But the good news is we are through that. As we look forward, we're looking to continue growth and particularly growth in masks.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. And then my second question really is, is operating margins. They compressed year-over-year on higher SG&A. Do you see sort of this new annual run rate as a steady state or should we start moving up from here with the higher mask margins?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, on operating margins, Joanne, yeah, I mean, we've guided to be broadly consistent on the gross margin. We set (38:46) that around how do we get through FY 2018 improving that mask growth and so on, that's going to be supportive for gross margin. Then on the operating margin side, we expect that we'll get some moderation in those SG&A growth rates. Things such as legal costs and so on have been hurting us through FY 2017. As we work through FY 2018, we're focused on driving some operating leverage and we expect to improve that over the course of FY 2018. And to the extent we do that then that will drop through to the bottom line.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: What I'd add to that I think is, as we look to drive operating leverage on a longer-term basis and moderate SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I think we can get more aggressive in how we scale our business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, Joanne, we've refined our operating model with business verticals that include the sales force and downstream marketing teams in region and in countries. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow revenue significantly faster than we grow our SG&A as we look forward to 2020 and well beyond. So, short term, I agree with Brett, we got some refinements and great capability to drive operating leverage, but longer term it could be even better.
Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Terrific. Thank you so much.
Operator: Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.
William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch: Well, thanks very much. Just again wanted to ask about the gross margin and perhaps why you didn't provide a range for the guidance, that guidance seems quite specific even that there is probably quite a bit of variability in the product mix that could occur – a geographic mix that could occur throughout fiscal 2018.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: You're right, Will. There's always going to be variabilities. There're a number of factors that play out. Obviously, we mentioned a few of them but you've got the interplay of ASP, procurement/manufacturing improvements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, there's a bunch of factors that play out on that, so that is difficult to predict, I guess. But I think broadly consistent. That easily you can see that is being not – don't think of that as being like purely consistent. But I think you could argue that's a bit of a range anyway around where we're at. So it certainly can be – and we've talked about it already on improvement in mask and so on conveying that we can get some expansion in gross margin. So I didn't mean that to be a really precise measure of guidance. I think it could range around that 58.2% as well.
William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks. And secondly, just on the SG&A as a percentage of sales guided to be declining through fiscal 2018. Is that because you expect litigation costs to roll off? And if not, are they going to be a material component of SG&A for fiscal 2018?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Well, we still have litigation costs and that will still be coming through FY 2018, but we didn't ramp up through FY 2017, I guess, and that was hurting our growth rate on SG&A. We do think – in terms of litigations, hard to predict exactly where that will end up, but I think it will be not sort of accelerating in terms of our growth from where we were in FY 2017. But we'll continue to be spending money on legal expenses around litigation. But it'll be – I think it's more broader than that in terms of moderating the SG&A growth rate, so it's not just about legal cost leveling out or going down or whatever that might be. It will be more broad-based than that. And I should say that guidance as well is notwithstanding pretty sharp appreciation in the Australian dollar, which – we got a lot of operating costs in Australian dollars, so we're going to deal with that as well. So, obviously, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind through FY 2018, but we remain confident that we can moderate the SG&A growth through FY 2018 notwithstanding currency impacts.
William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my call. I'm just coming back to (43:10) across the quarter particularly with masks, I know you've belabored this a little bit or were belabored a bit. Just trying to sort of understand when the back order came off and when we look at that mask number, we're sort of looking at really a sort of one-month effect of kind of full availability and, I guess, just trying to understand the exit rate to give us some confidence around 2018?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew. So, as I said, we were supply constrained through well beyond halfway through the quarter. So you can sort of look at it as, yes, (43:38) four to five weeks of the supply constrains starting to go away SKU by SKU and us getting supply ahead of demand. I think the fact that I talked a little bit to earlier, Joanne's question with regard to sales force having full confidence that they're going to have supply, that's not binary. You don't just go Monday morning and say we got full supply and the sales force say it's fantastic, I'm going to go and sell a truckload of F20s. I think what it takes is some time and they make some small orders and make sure it comes through and then ramp up because intelligent sales people with very good relationships with their customers and they want to fulfill those relationships with when they make a sale that we can deliver the order. I think what we've shown in the last four-plus weeks in the quarter is that we were able to deliver on all those sales. And so I think the exit rate from Q4 was very strong from our team in terms of what we're able to provide to customers for N20 and F20. And I expect that to continue very strongly in Q1 and throughout FY 2018, as we are completely supplying non-constrained and the sales force can be really out there driving the full bag of products that ResMed has for our customers, which is a really strong portfolio right now.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. That's great to hear that exit rate. Then I guess maybe without answering my own question, I guess, just obviously the UltraSoft does have a pretty intense replenishment schedule or monthly (45:05) I guess it's fair to say no real effect of that in this quarter, I mean, that sounds like it's sort of a next quarter event?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, the AirTouch range with the foam masks does have a faster replacement cycle. It's incredibly comfortable. Heat and moisture can be removed, but air pressure stays high, but it does have a fast replacement cycle. Yeah, I mean, we've really started launching that mid-May and so you've got very little, if any, replacement cycles on the AirTouch. And that whole category of a foam mask with a different replacement cycle in terms of comfort is really a category that we're developing over time. I don't know, Jim, the Head of our Sleep business and running the Americas last quarter, you want to give any further insights to AirTouch?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, I think we're confident on all three masks. The F20 and the N20 are both on great trajectories and now that we're off supply constraint, we're very confident in forward growth and in Q1 and throughout the year. AirTouch would start later, launch later. It's getting fantastic reviews from both physicians and patients. And, again, you're absolutely right. We're not yet really into it didn't launch early enough for us to see any real impact of resupply on the cushions in the quarter.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: That's great. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is on line with a question.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Hi. Just a question on Brightree. We haven't had an update in the gross margin of that business since you first acquired it and I just wonder how that might look today particularly in light of some of the acquisitions that you've made.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, Steve. It's Brett. Yeah, I mean, look, it's pretty consistent with those that we disclosed at the time we made the acquisition. So there's really no material difference on those margins. We got a couple – these are kind of like small tuck-in acquisitions, I guess. They're sort of not enough to move in any significant way the operating margins of Brightree so they've been pretty consistent through that period since acquisition.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. And then just with the R&D guidance, that looks like it's stepping up a bit in 2018. Is there anything you can talk to on the R&D front that might be driving that other than currency?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Well, currency is pretty big one. So, I mean, the two things is we'll continue to invest in R&D, so we're going to continue to do that. So we'll continue to grow our investment base. And the second one that's probably hurting us a bit on that, on the guidance or – basically I'm looking at 7% to 8% is really the uptick, I'm looking at this Aussie dollar, a lot of our R&D is still (48:06) in the Australian dollars. So that's (48:10) if I look at the forecast, that's hurt us a bit on the R&D – just in R&D in terms of the U.S. dollars. So those two factors have led us to guide around that 7% to 8% mark for FY 2018.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. And then just one other. Could you just give a bit more color around the effective tax rate? It's just even without the change around the Accounting Standard, it looks a lot lower than what I was expecting. Yeah, if you could just address that, that will be great.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Overall for the year, Steve – the quarter's a bit hard because anything you do in terms of the year-end calculation of tax, everything gets sort of trued up (48:55) gets concentrated into the last quarter. But if you look at full year, we're around 20%, and that was probably helped a little bit by the ASU 2016-09 Accounting Standard. So that sort of contributed a little bit there. Perhaps underlying it's more like 21% or something like that. So that's sort of where we landed at an underlying rate. If we look at it going forward, it's just I'd up-tick (49:18) that a little bit but just looking forward around the geographic distribution of taxable income is the fact our (49:26) stronger Australian dollar is going to be a factor on that, at least also contributing a little bit. And there're a few other things, such as the R&D tax concession in Australia, which is capped at $100 million, has reduced from 40% to 38.5%. So, a number of those factors that's sort of playing out on the tax rate and has led us to increase that just a little bit from where we were in FY 2017.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Great. Well, can I just ask one more? Just the other income line that reverses from a profit to a loss. Was that just hedging, or was there anything else in there?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that's predominantly FX losses through hedging.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: All right. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.
Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research: Yeah. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to ask about the portable oxygen concentrator business. (50:28) is that hasn't sort of grown, been a little disappointing. But what's your take on where that business is going and how you can really drive growth there, little pockets of opportunity?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Vic, I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about POCs.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Victor. Victor, we've continued to work hard on the Activox product and we've actually made a number of improvements under the hood, so to say, of the device. And we've seen a lot of improved performance. And we think our teams have done a great job on that improved performance, and now we're just getting that through to the customer base. But we're not re-branding yet. We're still waiting for further improvements that we think and we're happy with the device as – when ResMed puts its brand on it. So today, we're still work in progress, we're making very good progress. The Activox unit remains a very good, very long battery life device, and our teams are promoting it appropriately to key customers. So we're in it for the long haul and we believe it's going to be a very good business.
Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research: Okay. And then do you think, in terms of a ResMed branded product, you're well down the path in terms of development of that, Rob, or is that something (51:54)?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Victor, one of the things we've learned over the years is we really can't forecast our R&D program, it's just too good for competitors and everyone like that, so we're really reluctant to give you a timeline and details on that.
Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research: Yeah. Okay. And does this form part of this new – it sounds like you're sort of doing a slight reorganization in terms of the operations with the new business verticals. Is this presumably this falls into the respiratory care part of that business, is that right?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Victor, we've got a very strong respiratory care team that's able to focus on getting at and treating patients with respiratory insufficiency, the COPD is one of the main patient conditions that we're aiming to treat. We've got an improving and an emerging portfolio of treatment options there. We'll be building more of them. As Mick mentioned earlier, we've really generated lines of business where we've got much closer engagement between our sales organization and our customers back through to our R&D teams. We should, over time, see benefits on the R&D programs for that.
Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research: Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I wanted to ask was just about the acquisitions and other tuck-ins, but could you help us understand whether there was any contribution in the quarter and what you're expecting from those in terms of contribution in the next fiscal year?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. No, there was de minimis contributions in Q4 from those tuck-in acquisitions. They were really about technologies that will enhance our ongoing future growth of the Brightree offering. So, to maintain and grow that double-digit growth of high-margin business in Software-as-a-Service, we're finding tuck-ins of some good technologies can really help enhance that growth and drive further value for our customers. So, AllCall Connect, I met the team, they're actually with me up in Halifax with our Healthcare Informatics team, straight after the acquisition already engaged with our software development teams and really starting to say, well, how do we link this tuck-in technology with all the great offerings we currently have on Brightree and continue to provide that value as we go forward. So, the short answer is no contribution Q4 2017. We'll expect great contributions as that capability of AllCall and Conduit Office roll into the offerings from Brightree, some particular modules that will expand over FY 2018, FY 2019 and beyond.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just a question on leverage. If I look at the guidance quite literally, it would imply slight negative leverage in fiscal 2018. I know you have a headwind from foreign exchange, but what are the other headwinds that you have that maybe we're not thinking about and how can you get more leverage out of the business as you continue to grow the top line?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Matt, look, it's a great question and clearly we are looking for operating leverage. And you can't control things like FX and those just have to be budgeted where they are now. Well, where they will be, who knows, but we will see as those move. But the things you can control, your SG&A growth, your R&D growth, your investments across your portfolio and how you go to market. As I said in the prepared remarks, establishing these new business verticals, rolling sales into global businesses, we think there is a lot of efficiency we can gain here in how we grow revenues significantly faster than growing SG&A while providing the same or even better value to customers. So it's something that we are laser-focused on in terms of operating leverage, getting SG&A leverage and driving that growth. We're not going to grind our R&D dollars and not invest in innovation, I mean, that's something we're going to continue to invest at a very strong rate. Brett put that sort of 7% plus guidance in there and FX might tick that up to 8%. But SG&A can come down from 27% to 26% and below, because there are great ways to scale marketing through social media and digital marketing. There are great ways to scale our sales force and how we go to market in different countries. And so we've got a lot of very exciting plans for the next fiscal year and beyond, in terms of driving our go-to-market strategy that I very strongly believe will drive better operating and SG&A particularly leverage as we grow forward.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on line with a question.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Two quick ones for me. Maybe just on masks, generally just an update on the pricing environment overall and as you get up to speed with some of the new offerings out of the supply issues, do you expect, perhaps, a little bit of premium pricing on the newer offerings? And then maybe, just an update on inventory cycles, receivables, cash, it looks like inventories ticked up a bit as well and just trying to reconcile that with the supply constraints? Thanks, again.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the questions, Anthony. I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead to talk about pricing and the second part to Brett.
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, Mick. Hey, Anthony, thanks for the question. What we're seeing is a pretty normal pricing environment relative to historical. And so, we're not seeing any unusual declines in pricing. We're seeing the same steady, moderate annual ASP declines that we generally see historically in the industry. All of our mask offerings are priced at a premium. We're the market leader. We're the strongest provider in the industry and we have premium pricing. The new mask themselves also are at a premium to the, well, with the existing portfolio.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC: That's helpful.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Anthony, just on the inventory, some uptick there, but we definitely rebuilding through the supply chain to support the new product introductions and to get us into that good strong supply position. So an element of that is building for that and you see that reflected at June 30 in the inventory balances.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Anthony.
Operator: Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on line with a question.
Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. So, Mick, two questions from my side, first on Brightree, can you quantify the OUS or ex-U.S. opportunity for us?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Suraj. Yeah, Brightree has been laser-focused on the U.S. HME industry and has an emerging vertical that they're building in home health and hospice. And so, we think the value provided is incredible there. The skill sets, so none of the existing modules, if you like, from Brightree would be copied and pasted into our German business or to our French business. But the capabilities of running a Software-as-a-Service business, getting strong annually recurring revenue, monthly recurring revenue from customers, having them pay for the software per user per month is a very strong capability. So, we think that out of hospital Software-as-a-Service capability is an incredible strength that ResMed now has, and we are looking to, as I said in the prepared remarks, expanding home nursing and expanding home health and expanding hospice within the U.S. environment. We're also looking to expand our Software-as-a-Service offerings in France and Germany, and the UK, probably not with the direct copy and paste, it's more of a longer-term approach than that. Some things that we are looking to copy and paste and in fact have already started to do that are in the area of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including AirView and myAir. So the AirView software for physicians and for homecare providers has already been set up with service based in Europe, according to European law or with European security protocols and in line with the needs of our European customers, so AirView is going there. In addition, myAir, the patient app, that's universal, right. Humans are the same no matter where they are. And just translating it into French or into German or into Japanese is the pathway and making sure that we have all the right engagements around local law and security and so on. So, that's where the scale is in AirView and myAir and then the capability longer-term with regard to Brightree.
Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And, Mick, one last question, this might be a naïve question, Mick. So let's say I have to order a resupply or reorder a mask, whether a full face nasal or what may be and let's say that N20 and F20 is not available, what happens to that patient? I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there were supply issues, did those patients stick with their existing masks? Did they go to the N10 or F10 in the interim or if you can just help us reconcile because I'm looking at the 4% Americas mask number. Part of me is like, that the patients – are they waiting for these new masks to come online or did they switch to N10 and F10? Any color would be great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Suraj, that's a really good question and one thing that we talked about internally when we saw supply constraints was focusing to make sure that we had resupply for customers versus going after a new patient sale. And so, as I said, there were some perishable sales lost in the first half of the quarter of some new patients that we wouldn't have got on to a ResMed mask and the customer will make a choice whether they went to an N10 or F10 or to a competitor's mask, and losing six weeks or eight weeks of first (01:02:15) is a bad thing to do. But what's worse is, to your point, not being able to resupply an existing customer. And so we've really worked with our homecare customers to make sure that any resupply needs from – and the mask had only been out there six to nine months and so it wasn't a huge population resupply but that the supply was focused on resupply of patients who had already loved the N20 and F20, so that we continue to have those patients. Really our homecare customers continue to have those patient supply with ResMed masks for their life and so that was a nuance during the quarter. I'd see we're just past the bottom of the hour and so we should probably end the Q&A there, Mariama.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And I guess, I could handle this myself. But thanks Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the now more than 6,000 strong ResMed team, here at ResMed (01:03:14) diligently driving execution of N20, F20, AirTouch and many new launches as well as the future pipeline, and even more innovative products and software solutions that we will launch as we move ahead. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of tens of millions of patients globally. And we remain laser-focused on our goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. We'll talk to you again in 90 days with our Q1, FY 2018 results. Thank you for your time.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, again, for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website on investor.resmed.com. Mariama, you may now close the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Mariama. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website, at investor.resmed.com.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth again this quarter, led by sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as our new mask products. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then outline regional highlights from the business and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail. Let me start out with some timely news. Earlier this week, we announced the much anticipated launch of the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. The AirMini is a CPAP solution that is literally small enough to fit inside your pocket. This innovation opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers and delivers amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients. As a CPAP user myself, I have been using a ResMed AirMini prototype in AutoSet mode for the last year or so and it has changed my quality of life as I travel throughout many of the hundred countries where we sell our products and services. I can't wait for this technology to become available to millions of sleep apnea sufferers around the world as we launch the world's smallest CPAP. I'll talk more about this amazing solution later in the call. On the connected care and digital health front, we launched a number of ongoing upgrades of our Brightree and AirView software solutions. Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly. Throughout Q3, we have had strong demand for our new range of AirFit masks, including the AirFit N20 in the nasal category and the AirFit F20 in the full face mask category. We have ramped up manufacturing for these products throughout the quarter. And despite continued strong demand, we remain on track to have supply ahead of demand during our current quarter, fiscal Q4. At the bottom line in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis. Our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring appropriate investments in research and development as well as SG&A so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets. Now let me drill down on some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by SaaS revenue from Brightree as well as solid growth in masks. Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady. The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter in the Americas. This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products. The 97% to 99% fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal of the N20 and F20 are being well received. There's a long way to go on the ramp of these mask products in the quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. Growth in devices in the Americas was in line with the market, at 3%. That was up against a large year-over-year comparable of 15%. We are maintaining the share we gained during the last 18 to 24 months due to our great devices as well as ongoing homecare provider adoption of AirView solutions and our fast-growing patient engagement app, called myAir. We now have over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also have more than 5 million patients in AirView and over 45 million patient accounts in Brightree. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers, patients on a daily basis. We are proud to lead the digital health revolution in sleep apnea and COPD, but we are even more excited by the value that our customers see and how we are reducing costs for therapy setup and enhancing adherence rates for patients, leading to better outcomes. Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model. This quarter, we launched enhanced features integrating document management capabilities between Brightree and AirView. We have a robust pipeline of software-enhancement projects that will add even more features to help make our customers' workflows more automated and efficient, freeing up cash flow for even better patient care. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms, led by the cloud-connected life-support ventilator called Astral. Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our EMEA and APAC regions. Mask and accessories sales for the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products. We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20. This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia. Adoption of AirView by home care providers and myAir by patients is increasing in Europe as well. We achieved solid growth of our dental mandibular repositioning device called Narval. Our philosophy is however you seek treatment for your sleep apnea, ResMed should be there for you. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 Growth Strategy, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new F20 and N20 in the U.S., Europe and many other major markets around the world in the second quarter. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand for these products that led to demand continuing to outpace supply for some of the SKUs in Q3. Consistent with what we predicted 90 days ago on this call, we expect our supply to catch up with and get ahead of demand during the current quarter, fiscal Q4 2017. As I briefly discussed earlier, we announced the launch of the ResMed AirMini this week. The ResMed AirMini, once again, is the world's smallest CPAP. And, yes, it's also an APAP, with availability of our proprietary AutoSet algorithm. And, yes, it also has built-in humidification with no water that needs to be added each night. In addition, there is an AirMini app that can be used with your iOS or Android smartphone so that patients can continue to stay engaged with their therapy even when they are on the road. You can check out details in our newsroom, at newsroom.resmed.com. The key summary statement is we have created the world's smallest and most portable CPAP that literally fits in your coat pocket. One of the biggest requests for portable CPAP devices is the need for humidification. We have created humidification technology that's integrated into the mask tubing that we call HumidX. This amazing innovation requires no water to be added and provides patients with the humidification and comfort they have learned to expect from ResMed. Our well-established AirSense 10 device range is still the best device for at-home use. Our brand new AirMini just adds to that as the best device for use on the road. We have been conducting controlled product launches in select countries and the feedback from patients and providers on the AirMini has been excellent. We also showed the ResMed AirMini to physicians at the Sleep and Breathing Conference in Marseille, France. The doctors that saw the product there are very excited to add this to their portfolio of sleep apnea solutions for their patients. We will provide more details as we launch the ResMed AirMini over the coming quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our Growth Strategy. In February, the European research firm, Berg Insight, released their annual Mobile Health, or mHealth and Home Monitoring Report. This report named ResMed as a key global leader in remote patient monitoring, with over 2 million devices connected. We just announced that we are actually well beyond 3 million devices that are 100% cloud connected. As the world's leading tech-driven medical device company, we now have more than 1 billion nights of sleep data. Our digital health apps have been clinically proven to improve patient adherence and our software has demonstrated that it lowers the cost of therapy setup. We are developing and enhancing advanced cloud-based algorithms literally every day to convert big data into actionable information. The goal is clear; we want to lower costs of the health care system and provide better care and better outcome for patients. We are looking at partnerships with other players in digital health to enhance value across disease states, from sleep apnea and COPD to other important chronic diseases. Watch this space. On the clinical front, ResMed sponsored a research study that was presented at the Sleep and Breathing Conference that I mentioned in Marseille. This new study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea from CPAP to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV technology, significantly improves adherence. This is the largest analysis of patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. The de-identified aggregated data included over 200,000 patients and leveraged our connected care and digital health platforms to run the analyses. In short, the study showed that adherence rates were increased, with a relative improvement in adherence of 22%. These patients also used their ASV therapy longer and had significantly fewer apneas during sleep compared to the control group. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor central sleep apnea and to consider therapeutic options, like ASV, based on each patient's disease severity. Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 Growth Strategy. We are in the early stages of driving our connected care strategy in COPD, and we are making good progress. We have a spectrum of cloud-connected respiratory care products across our portfolio, including cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators in the AirCurve range, cloud-connected life support ventilators, such as Astral. We also have projects on the books for cloud-connected portable oxygen concentrators. With over 200 million patients suffering from COPD and with the disease state being the number-three cause of death and the number-two cause for re-hospitalization in the Western world, we are intently focused on testing and driving models that both lower cost and improve outcomes for COPD, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and beyond. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as clinical adjacencies, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This quarter, the CAT-HF Study was published in the Journal of American (sic) [Journal of the American] (15:15) College of Cardiology. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep apnea with ResMed's ASV therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes for people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. The overall CAT-HF Study results were neutral, with a pre-specified subgroup analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure who also have sleep apnea. Currently, there are no level of evidence 1A guideline recommended therapies specific for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure, which accounts for half of all people living with chronic heart failure. We believe that having the CAT-HF Study published in a major cardiovascular clinical journal is the start of a journey that may prove that ASV therapy can help patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. Another key area of Horizon 3 growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. This is an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our SaaS portfolio offerings. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017, including, of course, the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to pioneer connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep apnea and COPD so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and health care providers. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $514.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions and in constant currency terms, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $297.1 million, an increase of 5% of the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $182.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific increased 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $158.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $122.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, or again in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $35 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low-double digits. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. It the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 100 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices and unfavorable currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 gross margin, Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $137.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 16%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and in constant currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.8% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we've updated our guidance on SG&A as a percentage of revenue and expect it to be in the range of 26% to 27% for Q4 FY 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter was $35.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 5% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for Q4 FY 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $6.8 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter was $126.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $100.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62. Note that our prior-year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard (23:04) whereby we recorded a tax benefit of $2.3 million in Q3 FY 2016. In the current quarter under the standard, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.4 million. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting an unfavorable impact from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%. And, looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for Q4 FY 2017 will be in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $7.9 million associated with the closure of our Paris manufacturing facility. Cash flow from operations was $67.6 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increase in net working capital balances during the quarter, in particular an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable associated with the timing of creditor payments this quarter. It also included the payment of contingent consideration associated with our Curative acquisition and the payment of the BMC/3B litigation settlement. Note these items were accrued in our previous Q2 results. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $28.5 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we're still expecting to recommence the buyback sometime in fiscal year 2018. At March 31, we had $1.17 billion in gross debt and $341 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.4 billion and net equity was $1.85 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our first question is with regards to the current environment for the CPAP treatment adherence, is there any commentary that you could give on the overall market, both at a patient level and just general trends?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. With regards to adherence of patients on therapy, there's been many changes over the years. Traditionally in the peer-reviewed published press in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, adherence rates in the 50% to 60% were published in the literature. Particularly with our connected care and digital health solutions, particularly AirView and, most recently, myAir patient engagement apps, we have now peer-reviewed and published clinical data showing up to 87% adherence when patients are using some of our digitally-enhanced cloud-connected devices and engagement apps, such as myAir. So, there's really a revolution in patient adherence happening through connected care and digital health to get to those 80%, close to 90%, adherence rates. And it changes the game. It's better for patients, it's better for their doctors, it's better for the health care system because the patients who use therapy are less frequent fliers into hospitals. So we think it's good for the overall system.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's great. And then just kind of general trends in the market. How are you seeing the market growth rates?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: So, Matt, we see the global respiratory medical industry growing in the mid to high-single digits with masks growing at the high end of that and devices growing at the low end of that. And that's where we see it broadly globally. And maybe slightly ahead of that in the U.S. or slightly behind that in Europe, depending on some seasonal and economic factors, but those are the general growth rates, in the sort of mid to high-single digits.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Thank you.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Matt.
Operator: Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment, Brett, just on the gross margin and the various components that are contributing to that. I guess I'm a little surprised with the guidance for fourth quarter that it is going to be stable on third just because you are getting the benefit of that mix shift. So, what you were anticipating might be coming through to dilute some of that.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, Steve. As Mick said, we expect it to be back orders or (29:10) basically supply running ahead of demand and we've got pack (29:15) capacity there. So that comes through in Q4. But then I think there'll be some ramp up by then (29:20) within the market. The other thing I think in the Q4 we'll still be facing some headwinds in things like air freight and so on where we've sort of scrambled to catch up and fill the chain a bit. But that trend moderated a bit into Q4 as well. So just some of those factors are I think that we said looking at short term, we're kind of comfortable where we are. Clearly, we look at mask trajectory. To the extent you get outperformance in mask growth in a relative sense, then certainly that would support improvement in gross margins. So, taking more of a short-term view on the current guidance on that, given a couple of the headwinds around things such as air freight that we'll have to deal with I think through the quarter. But then expect that – we see that mask growth in there certainly that'll be supportive of the gross margin going forward.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yes. So the air freight cost is going to be enough to offset even in today's quarter result, the mix shift should've been more favorable, I guess. So, are there any other costs other than air freight?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, just think through it a little bit. Certainly, we've seen a big stabilization in product mix compared to what we've seen. But some of the big mix shifts before previously, don't forget, we had device growth which was huge, so we might have had spreads in those growth rates of 20% or 30%. So that really did exaggerate the impact on product mix. So you'll certainly see some benefits with product mix. But you'd need to see quite differentiated growth rates to see sort of massive movements I guess in that product mix. So it will certainly be positive. But you just – we have to look at the relative growth rates that we get through FY 2018 as we kind of ramp through the new product range and then form a better view after we see true trajectory I think on the new masks.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall with UBS is on the line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to clarify that you are in fact backorder into the fourth quarter. And just another question on the masks. Just when we might expect to see a 20 Series Nasal Pillow?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, we were on backorder in a number of the SKUs throughout Q3. As we predicted 90 days ago, we said we would be throughout Q3 and would getting supply ahead of demand in Q4. And we're reiterating that model. We still were on backorder on some of the SKUs at the end of Q3, but we are well on track with the factories ramping up their manufacturing to get supply ahead of demand in this current quarter we are in, Q4. As Brett said, that comes with a cost of some air freight. But we think getting patients this technology needs to happen and we're willing to invest in the temporary air freight to make sure that happens and we can get off the backorder this quarter and get ahead, get our supply ahead and get the supply chain catching up and look for the benefits from that throughout 2018. To your second question with regards to future products. We don't talk about products that are not yet released nor the timing of those. I'm very happy to talk about the product we released or talked about launching this week, the ResMed AirMini. But we won't talk about product pipeline, products that are not yet released.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Sure. And just to my quick follow-up, just on the U.S. tax reform announcements, just any thoughts around repatriation capital?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Well, I might have a first answer to that and hand over to Brett. We think it's good for business if we design a product in Sydney, Australia and manufacture it in Singapore and sell it in France, we don't think we should have extra tax on that money if we want to reinvest it in the United States. And so, we think some of the opportunities to allow companies to invest some of their cash in the U.S. is a good policy potentially. And, obviously, you've got to see that it can get through Congress and actually become law. But if there are some areas of tax relief for us to reinvest funds into, say, our Atlanta manufacturing facility or our Los Angeles, California motor design and manufacturing facilities, and beyond that, our software engineering capabilities in San Diego and Atlanta, Halifax, we would absolutely consider bringing more funds into the U.S. and North America. Brett, anything to add on that?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No. I think that's a good summary, Mick. I'd just say that I think, that in principle we'd be pretty happy with a repatriation tax. But I think the key would be what sort of rate they attach to that repatriation tax, which would probably be a lot of negotiations, seeing what they come up with. But I think, in principle, we think it's good. It could be an opportunity for us. But, of course, we just have to wait for the detail before I get too excited I think at this stage.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: No problem. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with a question.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Maybe the first one for Mick, please. Can you talk through the drivers of overall domestic device market growth or demand, how that might vary from quarter to quarter based on product launches? And maybe as you look out, what can ResMed do to bring that domestic device market growth into the mid or high-single digits and over what timeframe that can happen?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Americas device growth was 3%. Masks was stronger at 8%-plus. And overall growth excluding Brightree was at 5%. So well in that sort of mid to high-single digits in the overall category. Look, one of the catalysts for moving those numbers up, there's many. We're doing a lot of sleep wellness and sleep awareness work with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz. You're going to see a number of sleep awareness promotions through our SleepScore Labs' investment with those folks. And a lot of getting out to the 40 million people who are suffering every night and snoring and not getting diagnosed as opposed to the much smaller than that, 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, 8 million who are already on therapy in the U.S. And we'll not just be doing that in this country; we'll be doing it globally on sleep awareness and sleep wellness. The other way that we're looking to drive device growth is obviously by moving our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators. The whole connected care revolution that happened in sleep apnea will happen in COPD, a much more severe disease state. And that will allow us to bring some high-margin device growth in life support vents and non-invasive vents. So, there's some upside in both of those areas. And the third and final area I'd say is taking this idea of this travel CPAP niche and making it a little more mainstream. I think bringing ResMed's technology to something that's the size of the water bottle in front of me. And you can have a look at the videos. We've now released the size of this product. It's about five inches by three inches by two inches. I think having the world's smallest travel CPAP with ResMed's technology and no water added for humidification and ResMed's AutoSet capability will grow that relatively small niche now to be significantly larger and allow ResMed to really drive that category. So those three things are potential catalysts for us to drive up that device number. And I've got to tell you, we plan to do it.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: And in terms of the timeframe I think was the tail end of the question.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. So, look, all those things are going on in parallel and have different time frames. The sleep awareness is an ongoing one that we're planning over a long-term period. The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits. Reasonably quickly we'll start to see how well the travel CPAP niche grows. And we're starting from a very low base of what's out there already, but we're really excited to play in all three of those.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just as a follow-up maybe to the overall company growth. Can you give us an idea of what the organic Brightree growth was in this quarter? And maybe provide some context about what maybe you've been surprised by about Brightree in the last few months in terms of leverage points, owning the business and really its ability to drive stronger overall company revenue growth into that high-single digit range? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Sure. Brett, do you want to break out the numbers for the U.S. with and without Brightree and what Brightree's growth was? And then I'll go into some of the more strategic elements of how we're leveraging that.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yes, as we mentioned on, I think it was really on the Brightree revenue on the third quarter revenue for Brightree was $35 million, tracking quite nicely. And that's tracking low-double digit growth for the Brightree business this quarter.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: In that took, in essence, our Americas growth without Brightree at 5% to Americas growth with Brightree in the double digits really strong 18% top-line growth there in the Americas with Brightree. How are we looking at that strategically? I mean, obviously, we have full separation of the commercial teams on go-to-market on the sales teams on Brightree versus ResMed. But as we look at the broader market, having a SaaS capability to map workflows, reduce the costs of document management, inventory management, physician and prescription management and helping even with revenue cycle management for our customers, has really been an advantage for ResMed, an advantage for the customers, the homecare customers that have partnered with us in allowing efficiencies and freeing up cash flow so they can invest in better patient care. And then tying it to the digital side on the back end where we run AirView and myAir and are able to drive adherence rates from 50%, 60% to 80%, 90%, there's just huge upside in terms of the quality that that homecare provider provides to their customer, the doctor and their customer, insurance company in terms of keeping those patients out of hospital and happy for the doctors and the payers. And also for the patients themselves. And so it's kind of like altruism is linked to the profit motive when you're able to drive adherence up. And we're really excited to be able to do that with our connected care solutions.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question about cardiology. You mentioned the CAT-HF Study and some promising results in the subgroup analysis. What are the next steps in this area? And what can we expect on the clinical trial fronts?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, so we're really excited about the CAT-HF analysis on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Obviously, that study was across both HFrEF and HFpEF. But on the HFpEF side, the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction side, having a statistically significant improvement was very strong. And getting published in JACC we think is a major accomplishment. But it's the start of a longer-term journey, as you know, in this space. We have a number of follow-on clinical analyses that we are going to work on there. Professor Chris O'Connor who was working with Duke and now with Inova Heart Institute in the Washington D.C., Delaware area is absolutely – and all the – not just the primary investigators, but all the investigators that are working on CAT-HF are really excited about follow-on work. We're looking at other studies in Western Europe where there's some very similar results, where ASV can have a very good impact on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients. But these are long-term investments. They're not this quarter, next quarter. But over the next year, two, three, we think that that group, which is about half of all heart failure patients, that there's some really good upside in terms of keeping these patients out of hospital with no other pharmacological or device Class 1A guideline therapies. We think that's just an opportunity that we have to pursue, so we're going to be pursuing that over time. And we'll give updates on a periodic basis.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Great. And perhaps could you give it breakdown of where ASV now stands in the mix?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Well, ASV, we don't break out the category specifically, but I will say, as a general trend, it has absolutely turned around from the nadir, if you like, from SERVE-HF a quarter or two or three ago to strong growth and in line with and ahead of some of the growth of the other categories, particularly in Europe. We've seen the European team really double down on ASV for treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. That study that we did on over 200,000 patients – think of that, 200,000 patients in a clinical study using the digital health and connected care. That brings two things to bear; not only the use of digital health and connected care for clinical studies that can get published, but also a much larger population base that can show ASV can be better than CPAP for treatment of those types of patients in terms of adherence. So watch this space. There's more to come on combining digital health and clinical studies and looking at therapies like ASV, life support vent and non-invasive vents.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is online with a question.
William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on cash flow. Your data (44:17) and inventory days both jumped up this quarter sequentially. I'm just wondering if that's a bit of a blip and you expect that to normalize at the end of 4Q?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Will. It's Brett. Yeah, if I look, December was probably compared to our normal quarters, we were in a pretty good position on receivables. If I go back year-on-year and look at it last year, it was pretty consistent on DSOs, for example, on receivables. So I think it's more of December being particularly good rather than March being particularly bad. So I think it's okay there. I think that'll normalize into Q4. And there's just a few other one-time payments were being made through the quarters which pushed our cash flow down a bit lower in March than what you'd typically see. But I do expect that to normalize into Q4.
William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Thanks. And just on the U.S. flow gen growth rate of 3%, do you think you lost market share in the quarter? And, if so, were there any one-offs or any reasons, any contracts perhaps as a result that led to that?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Will. Actually, we think we held share. In fact, the incredible growth of share that we've achieved over the last 18 to 24 months since the launch of AirSense 10 and also Air Solutions and the AirView platform. We took very strong share with strong double-digit growth. But we think the market growth is mid to high-single digits for the whole industry. But flow generator growth is below that mid to high-singles and mask growth is at the high end of it. So we think we held the really strong share that we gained these last four to six quarters. But I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of the Americas. Any further detail with regard to share and holding and growing that?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Mick. No, I think Mick summed it up really well. Our market data shows that we held our very strong share position in the market in flow gen, which means that in the quarter we grew about in line with market.
William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that flow gen thought. You called out a tougher comp, but you had a much tougher comp last quarter, still grew over that with the flow gen. Was there something new in the market that would have taken that growth rate down? I think you still have the best solution, but just curious why we saw that change in the growth rate.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, it's really a return to market growth rate there. Which, again, ResMed we don't accept market growth rates; we like to drive ahead of that. Having six to eight quarters of outpacing the market to have a quarter where you're at pace with the market I think is acceptable for a 90-day run. But we don't want to have the adjusted market growth rate forever. And I answered a little earlier with Margaret's question of three areas that we're looking to through getting more patients into the funnel through driving device growth in COPD, neuromuscular disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy for our non-invasive vents and life support vents and POCs. But then also launching the world's smallest CPAP to drive really a cash business through our homecare providers, where we have a retail business from our homecare providers to patients to grow a really exciting niche. 65% of sleep apnea sufferers travel more than four to five times a year in the U.S. And right at the moment, half of them don't take their device because it's too big. I think that whole area is a really exciting one for us to grow. So, look, we don't want to sit back and just accept market growth rates of 3% to 5% or 5% to 7% or 7% to 9% on the various categories. We want to drive well ahead of that. And we have a lot of strategies to do that. We've had a great six to eight quarter run of incredible growth based upon our price strategy of changing the basis of competition from smaller, quieter and more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And we're not done with that. And that growth and that share we gained as you saw in the quarter is very sustainable because we're able to have customers get very involved in the workflows of AirView and really want to keep it as part of their business. So we think there's a lot of opportunities to come. And as I said earlier, watch this space as we continue to grow this market.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that. And then just one follow up on the P&L. I was just hoping maybe Brett could clarify what is in the other income there? You have $3.5 million. Can you just parse that out?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, that predominantly FX, Matt, or FX gains there basically our hedging contracts and so on. So that rolled through other income.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is online with a question.
J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: J. P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig into a comment that Brett made earlier about on the pricing side of it. It seems like maybe the pressure there has picked up a bit and I just wanted to dig into it. Is it more the mask or the generator side? And is this from competition picking up on pricing, or is it just the DME customers maybe feeling a little more of the competitive bidding squeeze rolling out through this year? Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, J. P. I know I got to tell you, competitive bidding has been in play for seven years now, 28 quarters. And there was no new news in the last 90 days. So we've seen relatively stable pricing within the U.S. geography, and frankly. Also in the other 99 countries we do business in. We haven't seen any major changes to pricing. I'll hand to Jim. Any further color within the U.S. market with regard to pricing effects of CB?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Well, competitive bidding and the reimbursement environment has been an ongoing challenge for our customers now for several quarters, as I think everybody knows. But there was nothing unusual in the quarter related to pricing. We see about the same annual downward pressure on pricing as we've seen in the category for a long time.
J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure. Thank you. And one more for Brett, if I could. Just on operating cash flows, if you look at it year-to-date, I guess for you guys for the last nine months, it's down probably 32% from where you were last year. It looks like you got more eaten up in inventory and AR. I'm just trying to figure out why that is, especially now that you have Brightree involved.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure, yeah. Last year's cash flow was, if you compare that to the year before, it was very strong cash flows. And we're working through getting some good improvements in working capital balances. So this year I think on the receivable side, we've seen good revenue growth. So that's been driving on the receivables. And working capital – working balances around inventories and so on just looking to really rebuild through with a lot of new product launches and so on has been happening. So, yeah, I think it's sort of a little bit of a building in working capital level what was a pretty low base I guess the year before. So not too much there. The underlying earnings are pretty strong. It's just a matter of keeping on top of working capital balances really. If we do that, we'll draw some good cash flow. So good cash flow, but acknowledge it's a little bit lower than where we were last year where we had very strong cash flows.
J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, J. P.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just two quick ones. I'm wondering if you could give us some granularity on your oxygen business in the U.S. and how you're progressing towards the capture of the COPD opportunity. Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean. I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead to walk through the market development for our POCs in the U.S. market. And maybe we can talk a little later about where we're going in Europe with that. But I think for this quarter let's focus on the U.S.
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: We think the POC business is off to a solid start in our hands. We've made some solid improvements to that product line. There's an ongoing shift away from canister oxygen to other delivery methods, including especially portable methods, like POCs. So the demand in the market remains strong. And we think that there's tremendous upside in that market as we continue to develop the product, make it a resonant product and bring connectivity to it. So we're very bullish on the outlook for that business.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. And on the COPD and vents, any commentary there, Mick?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, look, clearly, COPD is a huge market development opportunity for us globally. 200 million patients worldwide, many of them in some of our high-growth markets. As we start to grow particularly our China and India business, COPD will be a major play for that. I think in those fast-growing markets to avoid some of the sick care system where COPD patients get really sick and then appear at the hospital on a regular basis within many Western European countries that we're working on keeping them out of hospital with our cloud-connected devices. We can reestablish models of out-of-hospital care for those patients. So in developing markets or fast-growing markets, like China and India, about setting up systems that avoid the current sick care hospital care system in some of the Western world. But then within the Western world, it's about looking at things differently, trying to find ways to use connected care to predict when patients may have exacerbations and have through chronic disease management physician or nurse practitioner contact with a patient to prevent a hospitalization. We think that's a huge opportunity in the long term and something that we're absolutely focused on. And in the short to medium term, we have home health, hospice and home nursing capabilities within Brightree and beyond in the ecosystem which we think can be leveraged to help keep those patients out of the hospital, too. So almost three phases of COPD growth. One in the fast-growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe developing new models. Two, doubling down on our chronic disease management and connected care play for COPD. And three, some longer-term models to leverage our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service capabilities.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.
David A. Low - JPMorgan: Thanks very much. Mick, if I could start with the travel CPAP. Clearly, it's just being launched in the coming quarter. But could you talk about how big you think that opportunity could be?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, David. I'll start with this and I'll maybe hand off to Jim because the primary first marketed launch will be in the United States, where there's strong demand for this. ResMed's been in business for 28 years next month. And I've worked at the company for 17 years. And almost every time I've talked to a patient, they've asked me, when is ResMed coming up with a travel CPAP solution? I've seen the stuff out there, but it's not what I want. I want ResMed quality. And we spent a long time making sure we could miniaturize this right and that we could get humidification technology miniaturized and able to be used on the go and we could link it to the world's best masks and housings (56:32). And we got there. And I've been personally using this ResMed AirMini for 12 months and it's totally changed my travel life, whether I'm on a plane, in a hotel. Wherever I am, I get AutoSet, I get humidification and I get my Nasal Pillows, my P10 with me. And so right at the moment, to your question around sizing, it's a small niche. It's sub-1% of the device market niche. We think we can grow it very significant multiples of where it is now. And we think ResMed can have a very strong share in that with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, best connected, best humidified product in the category. Having said all that, we're in controlled product launch. I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity as a patient and a user. But I'm also excited as a business manager for where this could go. Jim, any further thoughts about AirMini and how it can grow the category?
James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I think it's actually difficult to predict how big the market can be based upon the current market. We think that the market is underserved. We know there's pent-up demand. And Mick referred to this earlier; there are millions of patients who are on CPAP therapy. The average CPAP patient, according to our research, takes four trips a year. So there's millions of people who are traveling. Half of them tell us they don't take their CPAP with them because it's too inconvenient. And so that's millions of potential patients who are looking for a solution. But what they're waiting for is a solution that's a ResMed quality solution. And we feel very confident in the AirMini offering. It's not only a terrific, small, in-your-pocket AutoSet, it comes with our best and latest masks with inline waterless humidification, so when you're traveling you don't have to mess around with water. You don't have to worry about finding distilled water and those things that patients have to do. And it's managed. It has a simple on/off button, so it can be managed without anything but an on/off for the patient. But it's also managed and reports out data to an app that is based on our very successful myAir app. And so the patient can look at their own data, can manage their own therapy, et cetera, in that app. So it is a completely next-generation offer from a travel PAP point of view. And as Mick said, one of the most frequent questions I'm asked is, when are you guys coming out with a travel PAP? So we think there's big demand. It's hard to predict, but we're excited about it.
David A. Low - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much. And just my other question just on the masks. The 9% growth was a good outcome, given some of the feedback we had about them and the commentary from yourselves that the products were in backorder. Do you have any sense as to what those numbers could have been if you hadn't been on backorder? How big of a drag was the back order on the growth rate?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: It's really difficult to predict exactly what that 9% number could have been if we had had no backorder. I know it would have been above 9%. So it's 10%-plus. Hard to predict exactly what it was because we weren't able to ship those products. I do think it's a huge opportunity for us as we go into Q4 to get supply ahead of demand. You never want to be behind. But of all of the problems to have, it's probably one of the better ones. But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: I think we are now at the 60-minute mark, so I'll probably hand back to Agnes. Oh, okay. I'll just close up. All right. Thanks. So, in closing, I want to thank the more than 5,000 strong ResMed team as they've been diligently driving execution of the N20 and F20 launches and the exciting launch of the ResMed AirMini, as well as our future pipeline of innovative products. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. I want to thank the global ResMed team. And we're really excited about the future innovations and strategies for what we can do with connected care and digital health for 2025 and beyond. Thank you and we'll talk to you in 90 days. I'm going to hand over to Agnes.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website, at investor.resmed.com. Mariama, you may now close the call.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed’s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially, are in the forward-looking statements detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Security and Exchange Commission. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and continued strong growth in our device platforms. We also saw the start of a steady ramp our latest mask technologies. For the call today, I will review top level financial results, outline some regional highlights and discuss key announcements this quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in further detail. We achieved strong device sales due to our leadership in digital health and connected care. The number of patients managed on the AirSolutions platform and the number of daily uses of our Brightree platform continue to grow rapidly. This quarter, we announced that we have reached a milestone with more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our cloud-based physician and provider solution called AirView. We have well over 2 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers and patients like never before. Midway through the quarter, we commenced the launch of our new AirFit range of mask, the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask. Both of the products leverage new step change technology called Infinity Seal that provide significant advances in fit and comfort to the patients. Earlier this month, at the JPMorgan healthcare I announced that we had received FDA clearance for the ResMed AirMini, our world leading, travel friendly, sleep app technology. I will talk more about that a little later. At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-over-year basis in Q2. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share or EPS was $0.73 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring an appropriate investment in both R&D and SG&A, so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across our global markets. Now for some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and 13% growth in devices. Device growth was particularly remarkable given that we were up against a 24% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas grew 4% in the quarter. This is up sequentially and reflects the fact that our sales team that received products around Thanksgiving timeframe has started showing the new technology to physicians and providers. There is clearly a long way to go in the ramp of these products in Q3, Q4 and into fiscal year 2018. Growth in devices was driven by the continued support for the AirSense 10 systems by our customers. These are powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions software platform, including the myAir patient engagement app that has over 1,000 new patients signup every day. We achieved good growth in our respiratory care device platforms in the Americas, particularly our cloud-connected life support ventilation platform called Astral. We earned strong growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions this quarter, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales, with some outstanding performance from our combined Curative and ResMed China businesses. We have now completed the earn out and the integration is going very well. As we enter the Chinese New Year, we have truly formed one ResMed China team with one vision, one mission, two brands and many and varied customer channels, the thing is really coming together well. Mask, accessory and other sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were down year-over-year due to a couple of factors, one we had some international licensing revenue from the comparable quarter a year ago in the region and two, the N20 and F20 were only released in a few countries, and as we know uptake of new masks is a lot slower in EMEA and APAC then the U.S. market. We expect this mask category to return to public growth in EMEA and APAC as we continue to launch the N20 and F20. Feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers on the fit range and comfort of the N20 and F20 are very positive. This is a great indicator for stronger mask growth in Q3, Q4 and into FY 2018. Looking at our Software-as-a-Service revenue Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model in the low-to-mid teens. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio. We are truly creating end-to-end software solutions for our customers and Brightree is achieving strong double-digit growth, with high levels of customer's satisfaction and customer workflow efficiencies gains. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I’ll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, catalyzed by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new AirFit F20 full size masks and our new AirFit N20 nasal masks in the second quarter. The Infinity Seal technology is a step change in comfort for patients and fit ranges of 97% to 99% of patient populations approving a winning value proposition with respiratory clinicians. We are seeing exceptionally strong demand for the N20 and F20 products and for some of the masks SKUs demand is in fact outpacing supply as we ramp up our production capabilities for these new technologies. We will continue to ramp up our supply and expect to be out pacing demand as we go through Q3 and into Q4. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month, we announced the FDA clearance of the world's most CPAP called the ResMed AirMini, it's a tiny portable travel PAP with all of ResMed's best in class comfort features. AirMini is intended to be a secondary device for travel, and it truly compliments our world leading AirSense 10 platform. AirMini is an amazing technology and we expect to launch this product commercially before the end of the fiscal year. I have personally been using a prototype of the ResMed AirMini for over 12 months. It has traveled with me to Asia, all over Europe and throughout the Americas. For those listening to this call, who may also be CPAP patients feel free to go to airmini.resmed.com and signup. We’ll make sure that you’re amongst the first to know when the product is fully launched through our Homecare Channel Partners. We continue to lead in the field of connecting care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have reached as I said earlier 1 billion nights of sleep data and are focusing on algorithms to convert big data into actionable information. The ultimate goal is to unlock even more value for physicians, providers, payers and most importantly for patients. This quarter, we announced results from a European study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzing data from more than 23,000 patients in Germany and the UK. The study shows that myAir patients when compared to controls, used their CPAP devices for longer durations and have significantly higher adherence rates. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea vertical, we are extending this cloud based coaching algorithms to our ventilation and oxygen technologies, watch this space. This is a great transition for the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We know that COPD is the number three cause of death and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the western world. The spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our ResMed portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes for patients with this debilitating disease. Connected Care in ventilation can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes in COPD and beyond. We continue to see portable oxygen concentrators or POCs as an important addition to our spectrum of respiratory care products. Our integration of the Inova acquisition has focused on quality improvements to the current Activox POC platform. We are gradually ramping the launch of this technology to our global sales team as we continue to improve quality and functionality of the product. We will ultimately add cloud connectivity to our POC platform which will help drive adherence for patients, fleet management for providers and activity tracking for physicians. Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of long term opportunities including sleep help and wellness as well as clinical adjacencies, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Another key area of horizon three growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. In the area of sleep help and wellness we are making good progress with our new joint venture called Sleep Score Labs with capital investments from ResMed, Pegasus Capital and Dr. Mehmet Oz. We started the partnership last quarter with an entire Dr. Oz show dedicated to the field of sleep wellness. Dr. Michael Bruce and Dr. Oz leveraged the S+ by ResMed the world's first non-wearable sleep device and Smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. The sleep awareness campaigning encompassed anonymous sleep data from a database with over one million nights of sleep. Sleep Score Labs calculated America's overall sleep score and Dr. Oz announced the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas earlier this month. Dr. Oz reported that people are not sleeping as well as they should, we're getting less than what the National Sleep Foundation recommends which is seven to eight hours plus of sleep. We are about one hour behind the minimum with around six hours of sleep. People say they're tired and people say they want to understand their sleep better. Sleep Score Labs will do just that, they will truly quantify sleep and help people objectively determine which sleep solutions are best for them. For ResMed this is about driving the importance of sleep awareness and sleep health. We will be helping people realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing at night or any shortness of breath day or night. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall health. We will continue to drive sleep health and sleep awareness and our ResMed brand as a leader in the field. Let me close with this, we are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017 including the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower cost for providers and improve outcomes for patients. We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep, so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers. We continue to bring out strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world. With that I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Right, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted we had a solid quarter. Revenue for the December quarter was 530.4 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 18%. Excluding acquisitions in constant-currency terms organic revenue increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $293 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $203.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $154.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $146.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 21%. Masks and other sales were $57 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms a decrease of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 17% for masks and other increased by 2% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was 33.8 million, with growth on a prior year comparable basis continuing to track in in the low to mid-teens. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impact of amortization for acquired intangibles, acquisitions related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and the release of the SERVE-HF accrual. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 20 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. These were partially offset by product mix, typical declines in average selling prices, and unfavorable currency movement. Due to current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue be in the range of 58% to 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $139.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increased to 18%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, and in constant-currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.3% compared to 26% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. This reflects expected marketing expenses associated with product launches and ongoing legal expenses. R&D expenses for the quarter were $38.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter, or on constant currency basis, an increase of 28%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 11% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was 11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.3 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 10.8 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 131.6 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 103.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was 76.7 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, consistent with the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54. Note that our prior year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. Whereby we recorded a tax benefit of 5.1 million in Q2 FY16. In the current quarter, under the standard we recorded a tax expense of 25,000. Excluding this impacts non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%. And looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. During the quarter, we recognize restructuring expenses of 4.4 million associated with rationalization of our European R&D activities. Additionally, we recognize an expense of 10.1 million for additional contingent consideration associated with acuity acquisition. The additional accrual was the result of the business achieving performance milestones that result in the investment contingent consideration payable under the purchase agreement. Finally, we recognize an expense of 8.5 million is part of global settlement of all litigation between ResMed, BMC and 3B. Cash flow from operations was 119.9 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by modestly increase in net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 14.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 27.7 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At December 31st, we had approximately 1.2 billion in gross debt and $380 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31st, total assets were 3.3 billion and net equity was 1.7 billion. And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.
David Low: If we could just start with the mask rollout. Mick, you mentioned that you've had some issues with keeping up with demand and you've also talked about the rollout into other countries outside the US. I was wondering if you could just expand on those two issues, and wondering particularly whether that production issue means that the rollout internationally might take a little longer.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question David. Look the patients and provide and clinician acceptance in the mask has been great. The Infinity Seal technology particularly and its ability to reach 97% to 99% of the patients that coming to a sleep lab or through a clinic. And so these acceptance has been great and certainly exceeding what we had thought it may be. And so what we’re finding with the new production technology that we’re using for this infinity sale is that, as we ramp across the different stock keeping units, that in some of those SKUs, we are not keeping up with very high demand, but as we look forward over Q3 and Q4 we will start to catch up and we will expect by certainly, the end of Q4, that we’ll be well ahead of the demand for the product. Rob, do you want to add something on that?
Robert Douglas: I said, regarding the rest of the world rollout, the volumes in the U.S. are much larger than elsewhere in the world and we really don’t see a big impact on the rest of the world rollout, that will continue slow and steady progress as we reported previously.
David Low: Great. Yes, looking at it obviously, it seems like a good problem to have if you can't keep up with demand. Just the other question I had, Brett, you mentioned in the SG&A commentary, you've given us guidance, which I think is above what we've just seen and I think you made a comment about legal expenses. Just wondering if that relates to the settlement that's already happened or are we talking about other ongoing legal expenses?
Brett Sandercock: No, that’s really the ongoing legal expenses Dave, I mean, we're into, obviously, legal action with S&P, so that's not inexpensive.
David Low: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Probably a follow-on call, sorry, follow-on question from David, just trying to get a bit more granular on the N20 series. Just the 4% mask growth you saw in the U.S., just if you're willing to characterize, was that mainly the N20, I guess, after a sort of flat growth elsewhere? And just also any feedback from the pilots that you guys ran on those masks?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew. Well both the N20, which is mask, and F20, which is the full face mask are doing very well. They both have the Infinity Seal technology this year, single-layer technology that provides excellent fit and moment for patients, I personally wear a CPAP mask and the N20 is particularly comfortable for me, but those products are going very well and doing well in the U.S. market and that’s what got us to the sequential uptick in the U.S. mask growth and we expect to, as we go through Q3 and Q4 and pick our production up to continue to grow quite strongly there and to turn back to a positive growth in EMEA and APAC.
Andrew Goodsall: Any new feedback from the pilot? Did it meet your expectations in terms of the way the DMEs are thinking about this mask ahead of other masks?
Mick Farrell: Yes, certainly as the DME or HME home care providers, as we call them in Europe start to see this product, that fit range, fitting 97% to 99% of the patients that walk through the clinic has just been a real winning value proposition for the respiratory technicians. The N20 is the go to mask for nasal now for them. And the F20, we believe is a go to mask for them on full-face, and its early days in the rollout, the U.S. team got this at the weak of Thanksgiving, they’ve really only had half a quarter and one with the bunches of Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, but we do expect as we look for Q3 and looks to Q4 and start to ramp the production up, that’ll be a slow steady gradual increase in both the U.S. and in other regions through Q3, Q4 and of course beyond FY2018. These technologies have a lot of legs.
Andrew Goodsall: That's great. And I just want to think of that 4% as a good lead indicator of the early success.
Mick Farrell: Correct.
Andrew Goodsall: Okay. That’s great, really appreciated. Thank you.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.
Joanne Wuensch: Couple of things. You mentioned the impact of lower ASPs and mix on the expense structure. Could you expand upon that just a little bit?
Mick Farrell: [Multiple Speakers]. Brett, you want to take that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Just on -- that was really truly that the gross margin year-on-year that kind of ASP product mix is probably the biggest one year-on-year, we’re still seeing, well we’re seeing that really strong device growth continuing and unfavorable FX impacts was quite a bit too. If you just look at it sequentially, Joanne, it was 60 basis points, but we had unfavorable FX of 40 basis points. So it was -- that was probably the drivers you look at on a sequential basis.
Joanne Wuensch: Okay. That's very helpful. Share repurchases, when are you likely to restart those, given your cash flow in the quarter? 
Brett Sandercock: Yes, we’re still of the view that we’ll commence that in FY18.
Joanne Wuensch: Okay that’s very helpful. I’ll leave it back. Thank you very much.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with the question.
Margaret Kaczor: Brett. The first question is really what drove the acceleration in Americas devices and the number was pretty big. The question is, it sustainable and can your mix of new products and ASV offerings really keep that revenue growth profile for ResMed in the low double-digit or teens range?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question Margaret, it's Mick here. So we did have very strong growth in devices in the Americas, it's 13% on a constant currency basis. We think that was primarily fueled by AirSolutions, the portfolio of AirView and myAir capabilities to lower the labor costs for setting up a CPAP by 50%, 60% for a home care provider. Also the ability for engagement apps like myAir to drive adherence from previous industry standards of 50%, 60% up to 80%, 87% in some of the data that we have talked about publically. So we think all that comes together to drive good sustainable growth and that does of course include some of the growth in the respiratory care line, our Astral ventilation, our life support ventilation line. Look we talk in terms of the industry growing in the mid to high single digits. Clearly, we were taking some share in devices in this quarter and you know as we look forward we'd expect to see you know good mid to high single digit growth of the industry and we'd like to lead or beat that and clearly we beat that this quarter.
Margaret Kaczor: Okay and then maybe a similar question on the international side. Obviously you had strength international generator, so was there anything specific to this quarter? And then I hate to sneak one more in, but the constant currency of mask growth what was it excluding the licensing fees that you referenced at the beginning of the call?
Mick Farrell: Okay, I'll hand it to Rob to talk about international devices and licensee. 
Robert Douglas: Yes, so Margaret, the factors driving the international sales are similar to the ones driving the U.S. sales, just that the sort of the ramp has been different as the take out from the whole process of explaining AirView and getting the myAir going is a longer process. Then the other really significant thing in the rest of the world data, outside of the U.S. data is China had a big impact, and so we had a very strong quarter in China, really related to the teams getting together and our integration plan going really well. And the team all pulling together focusing on new channels, really getting the sleep business and also really driving our respiratory care business in China. And then of course you know the Q2 is sort of like the end of year in China, is traditionally a strong quarter for us.
Mick Farrell: The only thing I'd add to that, Rob, which I think is really good is that ASV turned from the post survey check where it was a headwind into a tailwind again. And so we're starting to see growth in ASV, not just in complex sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, but the pain management and in the U.S. in the PTSD category. So all that together, Margaret, is sort of what's one of the tailwinds driving those strong device numbers.
Margaret Kaczor: Thank you.
Operator: Matthew Taylor from Barclays Bank is online with a question.
Matthew Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question can you hear me okay?
Mick Farrell: Yes, got you loud and clear Matthew.
Matthew Taylor: Okay great. So one question I wanted to ask is you announced the settlement of all your litigations with BG. And I just wanted to know if you could help us understand what the ongoing impact is going to be in terms of the licensing royalty revenue that you could see and the lower legal expense that you could have, now that you have this settlement.
Mick Farrell: I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Global General Counsel, Dave.
Dave Pendarvis: Thanks Matt, first of all we're really pleased with the settlement. We think that it is helping to validate the strength of our IP that we're now going to get paid royalty on sales in the U.S. by our competitor for the products that are covered by the deal. The reality is, those royalty streams will not likely be material to us going forward and you know that's fine. They don't have a large market share in the U.S. market. We don't expect that to change anytime soon. So we don't expect it to be material. Obviously there is a reduction in the ongoing litigation cost that were associated with that case and really a number of cases around the world, but as Brett mentioned earlier we continue to have really, frankly a larger case against F&P and some other ongoing legal expenses. So there still will be significant legal expenses going forward. But obviously one of the reasons you settle cases is to the avoid the further ongoing expense and that was one of the reasons that motivated us to reach this settlement with BMC that we did, but we're very pleased with it.
Matthew Taylor: Great and then just a follow up on an earlier question. I mean it's a little bit surprising that's late and kind of the flow gen launch to see such a big acceleration, was there any kind of stocking order or anything else that was abnormal that you would call out or was this just a good execution quarter?
Mick Farrell: Yes, Matthew I think it was really about good execution. The value proposition of AirSolutions has shown itself to be very sustainable. It's a sustainable compelling value proposition for customers. When you're reducing the costs of therapy setup by 50% or 60%, it's just embedded -- becomes embedded into the work flow and just how our home care provider partners like to work, they like to work with the cloud-based system. They like to work with one that's lower costs and drives adherence. And so as Rob said there was some sort of good acceleration in China and some good sales of our China team running through the tape. But then globally we're seeing the AirSolutions platform have a really good impact and Astral as it comes into play and is now part of the cloud-based or cloud connected system, is getting some good traction as well. And then the third factor is ASV, the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology coming to a tailwind. So all that together has provided strong flow generator growth and we expect strong growth to continue. And obviously the rates will be what they'll be, but mid-single digits -- mid to high single-digits is what we see the market going at and again we'd like to meet or beat that.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.
Sean Laaman: I've a question on Brightree. So good revenue number there ahead of us. I was just wondering, Mick, if you could give us a sense of I guess some of the CPAP share dynamics and some of the resupply dynamics you've seen amongst new adopters of Brightree? That's the first question.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Sean, I think I'll hand that question over to Jim Hollingshead, who runs the Americas. I'll just start off with, yes the low to mid-teens growth from Brightree is strong, again it's a compelling value proposition for our home care providers, and they like it incorporated into their work flows. Jim, any further color with regard to ongoing resupply sales associated with Brightree?
Jim Hollingshead: Yes, the Brightree platform, if you think of it from a point of view of the core sleep business is an extension of process automation. And so there's a lot of affinity between new Brightree customers and customers who are users of the AirSolutions platform and the data connection between the two of those platforms makes it much easier for them to continue do that. And so it's -- even though the two businesses have separate commercial teams, separate sales team out in the market they tend to reinforce each other in the market. Brightree customers tend to have a very good experience with ResMed sleep products and back and forth. And then the Brightree software platform for a resupply which is called Connect is getting increasing adoption in the market. It's very valuable for the customers who adopted it and it's very-very good for patients because it drives regular resupply for patients and they therefore have a better experience on therapy and that is a growing part of their offer.
Sean Laaman: Sure, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up when might we see the P20?
Mick Farrell: Sean, we don't talk about future pipelines to a great extent. We did open up a little bit on this call about the ResMed AirMini, the world's smallest travel seat CPAP that we got FDA clearance on, that was a public FDA clearance, but we won't be talking about the pipeline of future masks. But thank you for the question.
Operator: Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.
Will Dunlop: Just firstly on pricing in the U.S. I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that you had gone early with customers in reducing price prior to the introduction of competitive bidding on 1 July. Not all customers, but some I remember you saying. Just wondering when you might cycle those price reductions and you might see maybe a more favorable pricing environment in the U.S.?
Mick Farrell: Will, I think you're referring to something maybe 18 plus months ago, where they were some changes around competitive bidding round two. So 18 almost, 24 months ago [Multiple Speakers] when there were some resets.
William Dunlop : I'm referring to the latest round of competitive bidding. [Multiple Speakers].
Mick Farrell: So, okay. Well if it’s related to that they know that what we’ve being saying, which is the reality around the competitive bidding round three and round three national expansions, and the rebids going on now is that it’s pretty steady pricing picture, in fact no step change at all. Industry normal price changes year-on-year in a steady pricing environment. Obviously, we’re seeing a lot of competition amongst the innovation. Innovation in the masks and innovation in the cloud connectivity and connected care side. So intend complication for us and our competitors in masks and digital offerings. But in terms of price it’s been a very steady environment last four, eight, plus quarters.
William Dunlop : Okay. Thanks. And then could you just talk to demand for the AirSense in Europe please?
Mick Farrell: Sure. Rob, do you want to address?
Robert Douglas: We don’t really break it out, but as I said before the value proposition around AirView and the connectivity is the same in European countries as it is in the U.S. It's just that some sort of the dynamics of how people understand the value and create the value is different and it takes -- has taken more time to build that up. In particular, in France, we had talk about, there was some legislation or some rules supporting that that was going to effectively create a differential reimbursement. So there was more reimbursement, the devices that were monitored wirelessly. And that was then knocked out in a court case, but subsequently that rule has been reversed and we’re expecting sometime this year to see it become the norm that there will be that differential back in the French business and that, for example, in that one country, of all those many countries would help drive volume. Other than that, we continue to see the volume increases going on, the take up of myAir is strong and we continue to see that patients in Europe are very interested in getting their own data and using that to help their treatment and help improve their own health outcomes.
William Dunlop : Okay. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions Will. 
Operator: Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question.
Mike Matson: I guess, I just wanted to start with your manufacturing operations. I think they are pretty much all outside the U.S. One, I want to know if that’s correct, and two, how do you think you’d be affected by some of these border tax proposals that the Republicans are talking about?
Robert Douglas: Listen Mike, currently we have a very strong global supply chain footprint that manufactures in many countries and we talk a lot about Singapore and Sydney as being major part to that supply chain. What we don’t often talk about is that we do have manufacturing in the U.S. as well and our motor, ResMed motor technology subsidiary is based in the Los Angeles area. And we also manufacture some in the U.S. in our Atlanta facility. And so we’ve actually got the capability to respond to what is needed on a tax basis, as needed and we'll keep any eye out and be flexible with it. Dave I think you had a comment?
Dave Pendarvis: Yeah Mike, its Dave here. Though I think the one thing we can all agree on about U.S. politics today is it's going to be hard to predict. There are a lot of -- there is a lot of discussion about tax reform and what that might mean and we'll just have to wait and see what the actual proposals are, and what the details are, and what gets implemented, when it gets implemented. As Rob said, we’ve got opportunities to do things and frankly, if there become incentives to manufacture more in the U.S., clearly that could be an opportunity for us. We've got a lot of customers in the U.S., a lot of patients in the U.S. But we take care of all of our stakeholders, we look at what we do best for shareholders, what we do best for customers, what we do best for employees and take all those factors into account when we make our decisions. But it’s going to be I think a few years for things to sort themselves out, and we’ll obviously make the best decisions we can on the basis of whatever the details are.
Mike Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then just curios for AirMini, I think there is one other product out there that’s big part of that segment of the market. So I was just wondering if you had a feel for how big that market is currently, I guess in the U.S. at least, if not globally?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question Mike. The current travel PAP is a very small niche segment and what our goal at ResMed as the global leader in sleep apnea therapy is to bring the world’s smallest, the world's most comfortable, the world’s quietest and most engaging travel CPAP to the market. And so we think we will actually expand on what is currently a very small travel CPAP niche and create a sizable segment of travel CPAP users that are willing to pay retail cash and work with our home care provides who access those products and really make it as part of their care so that you can have the same experience when you’re traveling around the country, around the world as you do at home. So that’s the goal of the ResMed AirMini and as we launch that between now and June 30, you'll see us talk about how we're going to drive awareness, create that niche and make sure that patients the world over have the opportunity to have ResMed therapy with them wherever they are.
Mike Matson: Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? Just curious if the liquidation of AirStart devices had any kind of material impact on of your U.S. flow generator growth in the quarter.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Michael. I’ll hand that over to Jim any thoughts on AirStart?
Jim Hollingshead: It is a very small part of sales in the quarter. Not material.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions Mike.
Operator: Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with the question.
Suraj Kalia: So, Mick, a couple of questions from my side. First, you just mentioned you're expecting AirMini to be cash-pay for customers, specifically from a travel perspective. Mick, can you give us some idea about how you'll stratify this market in terms of numbers in the U.S.? Just trying to get a sense -- obviously, you guys have a head start here also, how the numbers could play out? That would be one question. And the second question would be how do you all view a potential Tom Price confirmation as HHS had? Our checks obviously are that he's pro DME. Any color from you guys thinking perspective also would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my questions.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Suraj. I’ll take the second one first and then I’ll hand to Jim maybe to talk a little bit about AirMini and we're looking at segmenting the cash-pay market and working with our provider, customers. But the second part first, Tom Price was a Congressmen from Georgia who spoke at the Mid Trade Conference in Atlanta last fall. And I don’t think anyone in the room knew or thought that he might become HHS Secretary, but when he got off on the floor and made a very passionate speech about the importance of home care, importance of keeping patient's out of hospital, taken well care of in the home. He's an Orthopedic surgeon, I think he understand the economics of the broken sort of sick care system where patients are frequent fliers in the ICU and CCU with COPD and we believe also sleep apnea is a big impact on that. I think he will be a big supporter. And if he puts in place some of the policies that he was advocating for in behalf of the homecare industry as HHS Secretary, we think it could be beneficial for our industry. But look you know as Dave said earlier, there is a lot of things going on in Washington right now, a lot of change and we're going to wait and be ready to hopefully see some more homecare friendly policies out of Washington, but we'll wait till we see them and then we'll act on them. But that sort of the early take on Tom Price, I’d say it's a positive for our industry. Jim, on the AirMini, thoughts?
Jim Hollingshead: On the AirMini, we see a couple of opportunities with the AirMini. One for patients and one for HME customers. Patients, we believe have a strong pent up demand for a good travel solution for CPAP. And right now there are some solutions on the market that we think are not up to snuff. We think our offer is going to be very superior and well actually as Mick was saying earlier, we'll grow demand in the category because patients really want to take our full featured CPAP with them when they travel. And so we see an opportunity for patients to have better care and more convenient life with their CPAP as they travel. For customers it's an opportunity because we know that our HME customers, especially in the U.S. are trying to grow their cash-pay business. There is more and more health care spend that's out of pocket in the U.S. because the way insurance is increasingly shifting the landscape. Our DME customers, HME customers are looking for and often exploiting quote, unquote, cash-payer out of pocket opportunities. We intend to take this product through our dealers which will allow them to service patients and that pent up need for a good travel PAP experience and also create a cash-paying opportunities to grow their businesses.
Operator: Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with the question.
Anthony Petrone: Just a couple on underlying device growth in the quarter and it sounded like there's some moving parts there. I'm just wondering if you have the combined contribution for Astral and Nova and ASV. And then maybe just a revisit on underlying sleep margins, where they sit today, just getting all the moving parts with pricing and mix versus Americas or U.S. and masks flow gens? And then one follow up question. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Right, Anthony, well look, the underlying device rate, we don’t split up sleep versus respiratory care and then respiratory care down to ventilation and oxygen. But as you saw in the Americas, a really strong 13% constant currency growth in devices and in EMEA and APAC, very strong 21% with the global 17% growth. We think that growth is strong and sustainable, but there are elements, as we've said earlier with regard to China where there were some things that where sort of onetime and there were other more sustainable parts such as the AirSolutions platform and its ability to continue to drive AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 sales along those lines. But with regard to margins and as we look forward, I think other than the foreign exchange impact, it was pretty reasonably good quarter in terms of margins. Any color there Rob, you'd like to add?
Robert Douglas: Well, I think as I said some of the drivers around margins in the sleep have to do with product mix, so while machines grow stronger as the headwinds for margins, sales strong in the U.S. compared to our lower volume markets in Europe and in Asia will generally also be a headwind to margins as well. Offsetting that our efficiency improvements in our supply chain and as we really cranking the production for the AirSense 10 and in other products we see ongoing improvement and it’s a continual headwind to our win rates, so we run neck and neck too. Brett, I don't know if you have any other comments?
Brett Sandercock: No, everyone thinks you've articulated it pretty well. I guess we try to take it all into account as best as we can and so we're still looking at the guidance of 58% to 60% and then it’s just contingent on how the product meets geographic mix, FX plays out during the quarter.
Anthony Petrone: That's helpful. And then a follow-up would just be, did you quantify the benefit from China and then just any comments on the Cures Act, with that passing, obviously, that pushed out some of the reimbursement cuts, how does that play out? Our checks are suggesting there's sort of one-time payments that DMEs will get at some point in 2017, but that it could be scattered throughout the year. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Right, thanks Anthony, I think somehow you managed to get four questions in there, but we don’t quantify the breakdown there. Rob was talking qualitatively to the curative ResMed China combination and its impact on the quarter, so we're not going to break all that out. Dave do you have any comments with regard to 21st Century Cures and impacts for ResMed?
Dave Pendarvis: Sure, so it's really well done by the industry to get this through, you know it's been a long time coming. You remember we were a while back and we were about to have some relief for the rollout of the national expansion of rates and it was stopped by a protest on the floor of the house for gun controls. Just goes to show you, crazy things can happen when you're trying to go through the legislative process. So the industry worked very hard, really across the board and was able to ensure that this time around it stuck and they got some relief, that was six months of relief and there are still some issues with competitive bidding rates and how competitive bidding is determined. But the industry I think on the whole feels good about having gotten a win and feels like, as Mick was saying earlier, that if Congressman Price is confirmed as Secretary of the HSS, there should be at least a sympathetic ear for perhaps some further regulatory relief. And as the industry moves forward you got some stability now. The rates are set with Medicare for the next two years, till January of '19 and Congressman Price has billed to add in binding bids, so that now anyone who bid in an area has to put up a bond, that's a benefit. And so I think the industry is feeling like it’s a better environment with some more predictability and some more stability and that's a positive.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question, Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.
Saul Hadassin: Maybe first question, Mick, any more color on just what the production issues involved with regards to those SKUs on the masks. In other words, is it a matter of adding more manufacturing lines, for example, or is it just simply putting more product through the existing lines and the demand has maybe caught you by a bit of surprise versus the production capabilities? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Saul, well yes clearly the market acceptance has been ahead of our expectations and Rob you want to go into some detail with regard to the manufacturing?
Robert Douglas: Any new product sold has new tooling and new things to learn about it and really new fine tuning to do on the process and it's really just a matter of mixing that fine tuning and matching that fine turning and process building, plus capacity building, which is predominantly driven by tooling and supply chain management. Matching that with the take up of demand and we should see that sort of match up as we said earlier through the quarter.
Saul Hadassin: Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up for Brett maybe. But just on the cash flow from operations, for the half, again, looks like it's reasonably weak versus the PCP. You did flag the inventory build. Should we expect that to recover second half as you start to clear this product that you've been building up, particularly on the mask side for the launch? 
Brett Sandercock: So, we've had -- I mean -- I think Q2 [ph] cash flow around 120 million was quite good and we just had some sort of modest working capital gain. So that was pretty good. If you look at comparing it to the prior year, I guess we're kind of -- working capital was definitely moving in our favor and we pushed that down quite a bit, so we're generating some big cash flow last year. But I'm still -- Q1 was a little low, it was quite happy with Q2, actually that cash flow ran 120 million, and you might -- we thought new product flow and so that we need to sort of catch up with -- and you might say that you're a little bit, but I still think overall working capital probably just a modest increase that we'll see.
Operator: Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on line with a question.
Matthew O'Brien: Just to start with on the core sleep business, by my calculations, and there's a lot of inputs here, looks like it increased, the gross margin increased by about 80 basis points. First of all, is that fair sequentially? And then is that strictly -- it looks like it's mostly manufacturing driven, maybe a little bit of mix on the generator side, but would love to hear your thoughts on that.
Brett Sandercock: So, I'm not sure on that. Sequentially -- if you look at this sequentially, we're at Q1 was 58.9 and this quarter was 58.3. I mentioned before unfavorable effects impacts around 40 basis points, a little high then what we expected with kind of deterioration in euro really through the quarter. I mean I guess the rest was pretty benign if you looked at it sequentially. If you look at it year-on-year which is up a tad from 58.1 up to 58.3 --.
Mick Farrell: Hey Brett, excluding Brightree.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, so excluding that we've got. Yes, I mean the bigger impact there is on product mix and we're still seeing really strong device growth. I think as we go forward and we get some improvements in mask growth with the new products and so on, then you'll see that impact moderate, but at the moment it's still a headwind for us, so that's kind of if you like kind of offsetting this to large extent on the Brightree. And had typical ASP decline and there was FX also year-over-year which was unfavorable, but as we mentioned earlier in manufacturing procurements so on, we've driven that and we've got efficiency there as well, which more than offsets those other elements.
Matthew O'Brien: Okay. I'll follow up a little bit offline on that. As far as Inova goes, I think when you bought that about this time last year, you said it would take about 18 months to refine the product, feel more comfortable in rolling that out to your broader sales force. Just based on the comments from earlier in the call, is it fair to say that you're a little bit ahead of schedule and you could be a little more aggressive in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017?
Mick Farrell: I’ll take that. Matt, I’d say we’re pretty much on schedule for that sort of 18 months, I'd get it to, where we think ResMed's quality and functionality should be. Look the Activox product is a great POC. It’s light and very portable. But it can improve in some areas and we’re really working on the improvement of those areas in terms of oxygen delivery and sustainability of that over the many months that they’re out there helping patients get freedom back. And so I’d say, I don’t track and we’re looking forward to gradually ramping that Inova product out there. And as we said in the prepared remarks earlier adding communication capability onto that and pulling it as part of the whole AirSolutions portfolio, we think we’ll allow home care providers to do better fleet management of all these POCs that are out there, but really engage the patients in terms of inherence for the product as well. So the conclusion is, I think we're just pretty much right on track with the versus the timeline that you talk about.
Matthew O'Brien: Thank you.
Operator: Victor Windeyer from Citi Investment Research is online with a question.
Victor Windeyer: Look, my phone dropped out before so if I'm going to be repeating something, I apologize. I just wanted to understand the rest of the world masks and I think, from the questions, you've been saying that supply outstripped demand on this. Can you just confirm that? And why the masks in the rest of the world declined 4% post launch and what we're expecting there.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Victor. So I mean, I’m sure, you heard the prepared remarks what we talked about. There are two factors behind EMEA and APAC on the masks. Number one, we had a big comparable, what was about around 8% constant currency growth in the quarter a year ago in EMEA and APAC. So we had some licensing revenue in there and some really good sales to particular customers. And we just launched the N20 and F20 at the ERS. And so it’s the first quarter out there and as you know, you’ve been following our stock for a long time, mask launches in EMEA and APAC, you're talking hundreds of countries and you go country-by-country and thy see the masks, they don’t immediately buy the masks. It can even slowdown the purchases of current masks, because they see the next generation technology and they put it through their systems, they have it as their frontline setup and they work out how to put it into the protocols and starts to get launch through. So as we said earlier, we expect to gradual improvement of masks growth not only in the Americas, but also in EMEA and APAC. Certainly the positive in that region and then through Q3 and Q4, we really think the impact N20 and F20 are going to be there and sustainable throughout fiscal 2018.
Victor Windeyer: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask about the sort of pricing and whether there has been a significant return -- end of quarter bulk discounts been away for a while. Has that come back into the market? How are you sort of seeing pricing around [indiscernible]?
Mick Farrell: We’re seeing pricing as I said earlier in the pretty steady state these last six to eight quarters. Back to industry standards on year-on-year in terms of price. So the competition is fierce, but it’s around innovation. Who's got the best fit, the best comfort, the quietest device and now best informatic solution to really improve quality of care with patients and provide us to improve their world flow efficiency. Thanks for your questions Victor.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark. So will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. 
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks. In closing, I want to thank the 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing tens of millions of lives. We remain laser focused on our long term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020, and we look forward to executing on everything we talked about this last 60 minutes and driving this innovation, great products throughout 2017. Thanks for your time today. And we’ll talk to you again in about 90 days. Thanks.
Agnes Lee: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If there’s any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com. Marianna, you may now close the call.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2017 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today's call. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Ferrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today, as we summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and strong growth in our device platform categories. For the call today, I'll review high level financial results, outline regional highlights and then discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. Then, I'll hand it over to Brett who will walk you through financial results in more detail. We continued to see the benefits of our leadership in connected care. The ongoing value proposition of the AirSolutions software resulted in strong growth for device platforms in both sleep and ventilation. Brightree's value to providers also led to recurring Software as a Service revenue from that part of our business. At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 11% on a year-on-year basis in Q1. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share was $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth. We continue to balance revenue growth, gross margin improvements as well as ongoing investments in both R&D as well as SG&A, as we prepare for upcoming product launches across our global markets. Now for some regional highlights: The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software as a Service revenue from Brightree and 10% growth in that region in devices. Device growth was up against a robust 40% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas was flat in the quarter. We are very confident that we will drive strong growth with mask technology that we are launching this quarter. Just yesterday we started selling our brand new AirFit F20 product into our European market and we will launch another mask technology imminently in Europe. We tested both of these technologies with customers during the quarter and they were very well received in market trials with physicians, providers, and with patients. We plan to launch these new technologies into the Americas market during the current quarter. We are incredibly excited about these new products. In the Americas region, growth in devices was driven by the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 systems, powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions Software platform including AirView, U-Sleep and myAir offerings. In addition, we also saw solid performance in our respiratory care device platforms with the launch of cloud connected Astral ventilation systems. We achieved good growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with balanced contributions from both devices and mask categories. We are now on a solid positive growth trajectory in ASV therapy in the region. We're seeing good growth in patient groups including central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea and pain management. We will see mask and accessories growth accelerate as we move forward with current and very near future product launches in the category as well as ongoing resupply partnerships throughout fiscal year 2017. We will show some of our new mask technologies to physicians and providers in the U.S. next week at Medtrade. Patient, physician and provider feedback from controlled product launches have been excellent and we know these masks will be very well received as they transition to full market launch. Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We continue to lead the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have high-quality Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree that continues to grow strongly. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality with our core AirSolutions platform. We continue to invest in a portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions that help HME customers become even more efficient and help them free up cash flow that can be reinvested to drive even better patient care. Connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing therapy adherence and improving patient outcomes. We are growing our connected care solutions in COPD as well as linking our technology to include other chronic care applications. This technology is a valuable asset that we will continue to leverage and provide insight to channel partners. This foundation of connected care is an integral part of our long-term strategic plan. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand over to Brett. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep-apnea business, we have achieved sustained year on year growth since the launch of the AirSolutions platform more than eight quarters ago. We were a sponsor at the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association that was held last week in Minneapolis. One of the main themes at AdvaMed 2016 was the importance of digital health, and the convergence of technology from data analytics to connectivity to patient engagement. This represents a significant shift from two to three years ago. I was on a panel titled Unlocking the Transformative Potential of the Internet of things, with colleagues from Deloitte and Medtronic, one of the other med-tech leaders in this area of connected care. While many companies are talking about digital health and connected care strategies, just a few of us are leading the way to value. We now have well over 2 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sitting on patient's bedside tables, liberating data every day. We turn Big Data into actionable information, which can unlock value for the patient, the provider, the physician and the payor. We are helping to reduce costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. With our expertise in sleep and respiratory medicine, we are also taking the lead with digital patient engagement tools that drive therapy adherence. Since we launched AirSolutions, we have been actively involved in clinical studies that show increased patient adherence and customer efficiencies, as well as demonstrate the value of our AirSolutions platform. Technologies like their AirView and U-Sleep improve patient adherence from baselines of 50% to 60% adherence all the way up to 80% adherence and above. These are game-changing capabilities. We just announced the results from the world's largest study on sleep apnea and connected care using our MyAir technology. This study included over 128,000 patients. These data will be presented at the Chest Medical Meeting tomorrow in Los Angeles and without stealing too much thunder from the investigators, at the highest level, these online self-monitoring tools engage patients and improve adherence to therapy. In the MyAir study, we showed an absolute increase in adherence of approximately 17 percentage points. This represents a relative increase in adherence of over 24%. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea market, but we know that these technologies and capabilities can be applied to our ventilation and to our portable oxygen concentrator technologies for use in patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. During the quarter, we enhanced myAir with the launch of a new smartphone app, which has been very well received by patients. We now have well over 1,000 patients each day signing up for the myAir app. Patients love getting a daily myAir score for their sleep, learning about the quality of their sleep and learning about the quality of their breathing at night. Patients like to engage with their sleep health as much or more than their exercise health and the nutrition health. Our view is that these are three equal parts for good overall preventative healthcare. Moving on to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. This quarter we announced positive results from a randomized controlled trial in the field of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation. The Acronym for this trial is HOT HMV. The data from this study were presented in September at the European Respiratory Society Congress in London. In HOT HMV, patients who received non-invasive ventilation in addition to home oxygen therapy had an astounding 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death in the first year compared to patients who received oxygen therapy alone. Additionally, the patients who received at home NIV and oxygen experienced an average of 4.3 months without a hospital admission or death compared to 1.4 months for those on oxygen alone. The reduction in mortality speaks for itself for caregivers and loved ones. The extra almost 90 days without hospitalization also speaks to government payors and to private payors. In the U.S. market, hospitals face a Medicare payment penalty if COPD patients are readmitted to hospital within 30 days for any reason. A future where NIV and portable oxygen concentrators are standard of care to reduce mortality and reduce hospitalizations in COPD patients upon discharge is well within our second-horizon view. Turning to progress in our respiratory care product portfolio, more broadly, we launched cloud-connected conductivity for the Astral platform. We continue to enhance AirSolutions to provide more value for Astral so that it can provide value for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients and beyond. We are on track with the Inova acquisition integration process and we're leveraging our quality systems and product development expertise to further improve the Activox portable oxygen concentrator or POC platform. We expect to make good progress in the global rollout of Activox over the following 90 days and beyond. We have significant opportunities to grow POC revenue by selling through our global market channels throughout fiscal year 2017. COPD, as a reminder, is the number three cause of death in the Western world and it is the number two cause of re-hospitalization. We know that our spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes to millions of patients with this debilitating disease. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of long-term opportunities including sleep health and wellness, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the broader field of chronic disease management. In the area of sleep health and wellness, we announced a sleep awareness partnership with The Dr. Oz Show through the use of the S+ by ResMed device. The S+ is the world's first non-wearable sleep device and smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to the field of sleep wellness with guests including Dr. Michael Bruce, a board certified sleep specialist and Arianna Huffington, the Co-founder of the Huffington Post who has written broadly about the importance of sleep health. The sleep awareness campaign involves selling thousands of S+ devices and tracking anonymous sleep data to create a database with over one 1 million nights of sleep. Dr. Oz plans to calculate what he calls America's overall Sleep Score and to announce the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas early in 2017. For ResMed, this is about driving the importance of sleep health and helping consumers realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing or shortness of breath. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall sleep health and overall health. This will be a critical part of the overall sleep awareness work. Moving from sleep awareness to hard clinical data, we presented positive results from the CAT-HF trial this quarter. The randomized clinical trial results were presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Conference in Florida last month by the cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Jonathan Piccini. Dr. Piccini's analysis showed a reduction in atrial fibrillation burden for heart failure patients who used ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV therapy to treat their sleep disorder breathing. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep disorder breathing with ASV may improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This is a large population of heart failure patients for which there is no Class 1A guideline therapy. Researchers are finalizing the manuscript for full publication of the CAT-HF study. We are excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally. Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new mask technologies globally. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. Customers are voting for this technology by signing up for our patient engagement apps and by voting with their wallets. We are also leading the industry driving consumer awareness of sleep so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers for diagnosis and for treatment. We look forward to executing on our strategies to benefit physicians, providers, payors, and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world as we move forward. With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett for more comments. Over to you, Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our recent acquisitions last fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid start to the year. Group revenue for the September quarter was $465.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 13%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $267.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas' device sales were $145.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.3 million consistent with the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms also an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $50.9 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $33.1 million. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers – the non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time expense associated with the field safety notification. In the prior year comparable, I've excluded the amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 58.9%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by an unfavorable but moderating product mix and typical declines in average selling prices. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 70 basis points, largely attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we are narrowing our guidance range and expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60% for fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $128.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 15%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our SG&A expenses increased by 6% in constant currency terms. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.7% compared to 27% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses increased by 8% in constant currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.4 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $111 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker British pound and a stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. During the quarter, we initiated a field safety notification regarding potential degraded battery performance in our Astral device. Under the notification, we will replace all the batteries in our Astral devices. In our Q1 GAAP results, we have recognized a charge of $5.1 million for the expected cost associated with this action. Cash flow from operations was $86.2 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increasing net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $27.8 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $391 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion. And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional question after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners, your line is open.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the Brightree revenue growth. Just wondering, in the quarter whether or not you've seen any pushback from DMEs with regards to ResMed owning that particular software.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Steve. No, we haven't seen customers moving out of the Brightree system since ResMed acquired or announced the acquisition in February or closed the acquisition in April or has formally moved forward from then. So, we've had a good eight months of customers being aware of this, and what we've seen is customer love the value that's been provided. And they actually – I think the customers I've spoken to love the fact that there's a multibillion-dollar public company that's going to make sure they invest cash in this business for the long run, which is investing in the infrastructure and extracting value for our HME provider customers and adding even more value, as we integrate some of the functionality from Brightree, as we said in some of the prepared remarks, between Brightree and our broader AirSolutions platform across sleep apnea and COPD.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: Okay. And is the gross margin on that revenue similar to what was reported when you gave the historical figures for Brightree when it was acquired?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Brett, do you want to drill down into some of the GM implications pre and post acquisition for Steve?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, it's Brett. I mean, yeah, that's pretty consistent with when we filed the 8-K, for example, on profitability ratios and, obviously, Brightree contributes to our gross margin there as well. Let's just say, we've got – I mean, it's consistent with our expectations. We're very pleased with how we're progressing and how Brightree is progressing. So I think that's good, probably, business there and it's definitely meeting our expectation.
Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mick, can you – or maybe Brett, can you talk about kind of the flat M&A or mask and accessory growth in the quarter? Maybe what are the inputs to that? Was it, perhaps, some people holding out purchases typical at the end of the quarter in front of the new product launch because you've been pretty vocal about having stuff coming? And then my follow-up is, within the 10% device growth, can you give us some flavor about the product mix and what the bigger drivers were within that across the range?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So, first, the EMEA and APAC masks and accessory growth was 4%. Americas was flat. Obviously, we showed these new technologies at the European Respiratory Society Congress in September and, as you noted, Ben, we've been pretty public about that and so it had been out in the public forum. There may have been some impact on Americas' customers knowing that new products will be coming to market soon in terms of their purchases during the September quarter. But look, the way that we look at it is, we've got some excellent first results here on our controlled product launches on this product, the F20. It's an excellent full face mask that we think is going to be incredibly successful as we've tested it out there. And certainly, there were some customers testing it in the Americas and some customers testing it in Europe, and we did show it at the conference there in European Respiratory Society, but we do expect very significant growth for this throughout fiscal 2017 and we will launch the product, as I said, we launched it yesterday in Europe. And we will launch it – another technology into Europe and both technologies we plan to launch into the U.S. this quarter. So, I do think the future looks pretty exciting on that front. To the devices, breaking out the 10% year-on-year growth in devices in the Americas, we don't typically break it out precisely between how much was ventilation and how much of the growth was sleep, but we talk about the sleep apnea market generally growing in that sort of mid to high single-digit number and devices growing in the mid single-digits and masks growing at the high single-digits. So you can sort of look at that 10% and say, well, if it's mid single-digits on the sleep flow generators then there's some incremental growth from the ventilation and the portable oxygen concentrators on top of that.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And, I guess, if you'll allow me, I'll just ask about Activox and how you might size the OUS opportunity as you launch that over fiscal 2017 because that's the first you talked about that rolling out more broadly? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Well, Ben, we'll give an update next quarter as we really start to roll that out. The point I was making in this call is that we've now got the quality to a level that we like and that we are launching it now throughout not only U.S. but our global sales forces over the coming quarter. And as you know, the sale cycle on POCs is an S-curve and you start to ramp that up this quarter, but we'll give an update in 90 days as to the progress on that. Thanks for the questions, Ben.
Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly wanted to ask you about SG&A growth accelerated this quarter, and I'm wondering whether that's related to the upcoming product launches or if there's something else in there, if you could talk about that would be great. Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Will, there are two factors involved in SG&A. One is the absorption of some of the acquisitions we've made and that has contributed to the SG&A. And in addition to that, as you noted, we're launching two new masks in Europe and we plan to launch them in the Americas and these things that we prepare for. We've done them many times, but you do prepare for them in terms of the marketing, promotional capabilities and so on. So, those two factors of the acquisitions and the preparation to new product launches were both factors in the SG&A.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And then, on gross margin, despite what seems to be quite a negative product mix effect in the U.S., you still posted very strong non-GAAP gross margin relative to the last few quarters. Can you just talk to the pricing environment in the U.S. and whether you are seeing pressure to cut prices and whether you think you will, as a result of Medicare funding cuts that went live in July? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Will, I'll take the second part of that and I will hand it to Brett for the first part of that on the broader GM review and what's going on there. But with regard to pricing, we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary in pricing. You know this. Obviously, we don't break it out in detail here, but what I'd say is we've seen sort of what we've seen traditionally in year-on-year price deltas in our U.S. and other markets, throughout the whole CB process, it's been very visual and open as to what the new prices will be, and we've been working with our customers as soon as prices were announced six months ago, not as they start to go into play during this sort of July, August, September quarter. So, pretty steady as she goes in terms of historic price deltas there. But, Brett, do you want to provide a little color for Will with regard to what's happening there with GM?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, even though the product mix continued to be unfavorable for us, it's certainly moderating. That headwind has definitely moderated in this quarter, which is good. And the other thing also on ASVs, which is a pretty big headwind, our ASVs returned to a growth trajectory, and that's helping us on the product mix piece of this. It's not a headwind now. The biggest component there, I think, that has been driving through on the margins being manufacturing and procurement and sort of really getting some traction on those cost-out programs that we've been running all the time, but it's becoming more evident because of that product mix moderating. So, that's sort of working through. As you know, the first 12 months we couldn't really work on it. We were really concentrating or focusing on just meeting demand. But as we've worked through the last 12 months, we've been really able to ratchet up that program and the team's done a great job just working through on the various cost-out programs, particularly for the platforms. And that's definitely now flowing through on the gross margin. And, I guess, the other one, obviously, the Brightree acquisition is a meaningful contributor as well. So, I mean, I guess, you're saying some of these headwinds are perhaps turning into tailwinds. So we're seeing that come through on the gross margin.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much. If we could now return to Brightree, I was just wondering if you could talk to the level of growth you've seen given we don't have much in the way of historics and perhaps some sense as to what integration benefits or what the opportunity feels like it could be now that you've owned it for, I think, you said, eight months?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Look, the Brightree growth is in that sort of low-to-mid teens, low teens sort of area, good solid double-digit growth. It's 80, 90%-plus recurring revenue there, David. So the Brightree business is a very solid and strong recurring revenue business. It's providing incredible value to providers automating process flows for inventory management, clinical informatics management, revenue cycle management in terms of ensuring payment and also even managing physician scripts. And so, when you think about the synergistic value, if you like, between a customer who is operating on ResMed's AirSolutions for patient engagement through myAir and physician engagement through AirView and now HME engagement through Brightree, there are many of those workflows that you can look to if you are removing costs from the front-end of patient engagement and the back-end of inventory management that there can be synergies in saving those costs for the HME provider. And so, we are working with all our customers who use both AirSolutions, Brightree and particularly those who use both to really help them garner those savings in their own operating costs to improve their own P&L and free up more of their own cash flow to then reinvest in better patient care and drive adherence rates up of the likes of what we've seen in the myAir study and the U-Sleep where we're able to achieve 80-plus percent adherence rates. That's a win for the patient obviously, but it's also a win for the physician getting the patient on therapy and the provider in terms of keeping that sleep apnea patient on good therapy and ongoing resupply.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks. And if I could just change topics a little bit. You talked about the connected devices and I think more than 2 million connected with AirSolutions now. Just making sure that I understand, I mean, this is AirSense, AirCurve products, are the vast majority of those devices that you've sold effectively, connected devices now?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Since we launched the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 lines, every single sleep apnea non-invasive ventilation device that we've sold has communications capabilities in it and so we have more than 2 million of them – well over 2 million of them sending data to the cloud every day, so that if it's sent at 6:30 in the morning, we call it the halo, hour after last off, by 7:30 in the morning those data are available for the patient that they can review on myAir, for the doctor if they go see them at an 8 o'clock appointment on AirView and even for the government of Finland or United Blue Cross Blue Shield in terms of their population health management into their systems that very day.
David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: All right. Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.
Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our questions for – first for R&D and we're looking to see whether or not this increase in guidance is kind of the short-term related to acquisitions and integration or if this is kind of more of a longer-term strategy? And then my follow-up question is, with regards to the Curative acquisition, we're at the one-year mark. Is there any observations that you've made that were different from your initial expectations? Thank you very much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Matt and I'll hand both of those, actually, over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, the R&D increase largely has been around bringing the acquisitions in and the engineering work that we wanted to do make sure quality is right and really synchronizing the roadmaps and making sure everything is on track. We're committed to innovating in our industry and we see the R&D program sort of continuing apace. We've got a lot more things on our roadmaps than what we can actually do and a lot more plans and ideas and anything we can invest sensibly into the R&D program we will. On to your other question regarding Curative, you're asking about any differences from how the early integration program went? We're really encouraged with Curative and its position in the Chinese market. The whole Chinese economy has had some interesting developments and changes and things going on like anticorruption drives and stuff like that have made the market continue to be interesting. We still see a huge opportunity there just in terms of the number of untreated patients, both in obstructive sleep apnea and also in the number of untreated COPD patients in the standard of care there. We're making great progress on the integration program. We're very happy with the role of a few key players that we've got in China at the moment. We've got Justin Leong, who's sort of heading up our Asia Growth Markets Group and Jason Sun, who's remained as the CEO of the Curative subsidiary and together they are bringing together the team of Curative and ResMed and we're the major player in treating sleep disorder breathing and long-term ventilation in China and we've got lots of good plans to further develop that.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to know if you've got any early feedback on the launch of the new 20 series mask just from the market testing that you're doing? And then just a follow-up question is, to what extent does your outlook or your upgrade gross margin consider that new mask launch?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions, Andrew. Yeah, clearly, we've got some really good early data from the controlled product launches of F20 in Europe and in the U.S. markets in these sort of controlled product launches where we've had customers looking at the product, putting it on patients, seeing how the setup goes for a provider and working with physicians so that they can see the change of care. The F20 is a fabulous full face mask, one of the best I've seen that ResMed's produced and I think as you look forward over the next number of quarters, this thing is going to be a real winner for us. To your second part about upgrading our gross margin guidance, I'll let Brett go into that in more detail. But at a high level, yeah, there's a combination of ASV. As Brett said earlier, ASV has turned from a headwind now to tailwind. Mask growth is at its nadir here as we transition from two-year-old mask products to brand-new mask product and both of those tailwinds in terms of positive GM contributions. But Brett, any further color on that for GM?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Maybe we try to look at that and try to factor that in. As you know on gross margin, it's always hard to predict because you've got ASP movements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, what we do in manufacturing and procurement. What happens with how the acquisitions go on and so on, so sort of pool that in. But, I guess we're getting kind of more confidence in the range there on the margin and certainly we saw some really good improvements on the margin in Q1. And clearly we look to build on those. But in terms of the product mix, to the extent that the mask growth accelerates, then we think these masks will be successful and we do think we'll get shares back with these masks and clearly that's going to be supportive of the gross margin. And then it just depends on relative mix of devices versus masks and so on. But it certainly is – the expectation is those new masks will be supportive of the gross margin. I mean, you'd have to think that.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Yeah. Terrific. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Just to follow up a little bit on the mask commentary, given that you have rolled that out internationally and we're going to see it next week at MedTrade, could you just talk a little bit about what are some of the unique or differentiating points that you see in the mask versus what you've been selling and how should we think about things from the cannibalization and pricing perspective? Is this environment one where you can ask for some uplift in pricing versus what you are charging right now?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Matt. I'll take the second part, and then I'll hand the first part to Rob to talk about some of the features of the F20. Yeah. With regard to pricing, we work very carefully with our customers in each of the 100 countries we're selling to and each market we're launching to. This is some very innovative technology in these multiple mask technologies that we're bringing to market. And we are certainly working with customers to understand that value and ensure the price is appropriately in line with that value. And, so I see it rolling in as we traditionally have with our mask launches at appropriate pricing that takes account of the value but also takes account of the realistic nature of the markets in which we're selling in the healthcare world. Rob, do you want to take the second part?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Sure.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: The first part of the question, second.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. These masks are really about comfort and feel and ease-of-use. Our early testing – all of our mask development programs are heavily involved with working with patients and trying ideas and working through, and it's sort of iterative, it keeps going. But we believe the F20 and the N20 have really superior seal and that they just don't leak, and that they're more comfortable and easy to use than earlier masks. To your question of cannibalization, the market will pull out as to what are the preferences, and people will have to develop their preferences over time for that, and so that will take some time to fallout. But we are extremely excited about the response that we've already had on these masks.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. What I would add on there is, if there is any cannibalization, it's cannibalization of some of the competitors' positions in full face and nasal. So we will not only keep going in the market as we are with Dr. Oz and reaching out to new patients in, but I think we'll be taking some good share in these categories as we launch this amazing new mask technology.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then as a follow-up, just a little bit more color on the North American generator performance in the quarter. You had Astral, you said ASV is a tailwind, you are benefiting somewhat from the COPD purchase. Is it fair – and I know you have a really difficult comp here in fiscal Q1, but is it fair to say that that business is actually down when you exclude those other products or was it still positive?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: No, it was still up. We are not going to break it out in detail, but what I said earlier, I'll say again, which is the sleep market is growing mid-to-high single digits where the devices are growing mid-single digits, masks growing at high-single digits. We held share in our sleep devices.
Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Victor Windeyer from Citi is online with a question.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks very much. Look I just wanted to understand mask growth a little bit more, if I can on . The high-single digit mask rise, perhaps you could, like in the industry, if you like, but perhaps you could break out what is your number one volume growth and what the, I guess, the key factors are that are driving that. How long that can continue for?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vic. With regard to mask growth, revenues and volume, we don't break out pricing delta. What we acknowledged in the prep remarks and I'll say again, we lost some share in masks in the quarter. If masks are growing at high-single digits in the U.S. market and we're growing 01, then we're losing some share. We're very confident with the new masks we are launching. Well, we are launching today, yesterday in Europe and over this quarter. We plan to launch them again in the U.S. and beyond in global markets that we will get back to not only strong market growth, but above market growth as I alluded to earlier. These are great masks that will move us up there. So we're seeing good market growth of mid-to-high single digits in masks and there's always price declines to play in there, so you've got low-double digit growth in volumes of masks in the market that really hasn't changed from Q4 to Q1. It's more about the product lifecycle of our two-year old masks and the brand new ones that are just coming to market.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. I guess, I was interested in understanding the importance of your informatics platforms to driving growth in the mask and supply side, and whether you can with your position there, you may get a better part of the share of that going forward?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Clearly we have a very large investment in the infrastructure with healthcare informatics and AirSolutions. There's a much more direct relationship between the informatics and the connected care and the value we provide to the device growth. We've seen that very strong for now, eight quarters since the launch of AirSolutions, AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10. There is a connection to masks. Clearly, it's often linked when you think about it all the way through to the ReSupply program. So we have ResMed ReSupply, we have Brightree Connect. We have a number of offerings in the U.S. market, a number of different offerings for customers in EMEA and APAC where the go-to-market models are different. We're engaging patients better than ever. Patients are signing up to understand things like myAir and as part of that we're absolutely contacting patients to let them know when it's time for a new mask and then to push them through the system. And, so I do think that – and different markets of the world there's different ways of doing that. You're going to see – as you look forward over FY 2017, 2018 and beyond, a lot more interplay not only between the informatics and device, informatics and masks but also informatics in chronic disease management, keeping these patients out of hospital and providing holistic value to the healthcare system by what we can do.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thanks so much.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the questions.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks and good morning, guys. Mick, maybe the first question on the Astral and just if you could talk to what impact, if any, that field safety notice had? Also on sales and just what you see in terms of take-up of that device in the non-invasive ventilation category, please.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll take the second part and hand the first part of it to Rob. Sales of the Astral in terms of its use, it's pretty broad. It's different in every market in the world and in Germany, it's far more used as a life support ventilator and in the life support ventilation side. In the U.S., it's kind of split between Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular disease and COPD. With the changes in reimbursement that have been announced recently and have been ongoing for a year-plus in the COPD side, we've actually been focusing since we have no entrenched sales in this field saying to the customers, do you want non-invasive ventilation like an AirCurve 10 SST Bi-Level type product or do you want Astral and for which types of patients would you choose this? We are working with physicians and providers to do that. And so, we're really partnering with our HMEs and with the physicians to make sure and keeping the whole context of the healthcare economics that are involved to make sure that the right therapy goes on the right patient and that it's sustainable over time. So that's how we look at NIV as well as LSV for neuromuscular disease and COPD. But as for the field safety notice, Rob, do you want to?
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll just give a bit of background on it. We had a small number of reports of degraded battery performance. But there continue to be no adverse health effects from the degraded performance. And there are very clear mitigations for patients around it. But we felt it was the right thing to do to put out the field safety notice and alert ventilator-dependent patients and their carers about the issue, how they should mitigate the risks and where appropriate how to arrange for replacement batteries. It's a rolling replacement program. It is proceeding well, and we are communicating closely on an ongoing basis with the customers for this. We have to manage the patient population very, very carefully, of course, with this type of device. But the program is running along to plan at this stage.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Saul.
Operator: Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Good morning, everybody. Two quick questions. Mick, the first one is the – and I might have missed it, the time to full rollout of the new mask series. So when will it be available to all of your customers? And, secondly, I don't know if you could give us a sense of organic growth. I know you've split out Brightree nicely for us but broad organic growth for the rest of the business would be great.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: So I'll take the first part, and I'll give the second part of the question to Brett. So the time to the full rollout – one thing, we're obviously very open here on a public conference call, but we don't want to give full indication to our competitors as to the date, the time and the hour of the launch of the F20 in each of the specific country markets. I'll talk broadly to the fact that we've launched in Western Europe yesterday. So this is available across major countries in Western Europe already and that our plan is to launch into the Americas and the U.S. specifically this quarter. But I don't really want to go into any more granularity than that for competitive reasons on this call, Sean. But I can tell you this thing is going to take off and it's going to be a very valuable mask as it rolls to each of those countries as we launch it. Brett, do you want to have a breakdown of the acquisition versus organic growth question?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Sure. I mentioned that earlier Sean, so the organic growth in revenue for us was 3% this quarter.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.: Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I have, guys. Thank you very much.
Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.: Great.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the breakdown of the acquisitions. Can you just talk about not just the top-line growth, how much did acquisitions contribute to the bottom line this quarter?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yes. Matt, we've sort of broken down and given more details in terms of revenue but we haven't gone down line by line or segmentation out in terms of the acquisition. So at this discussion, we would prefer to keep it that way.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Just curious...
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: I will say that, you know, I mean, you know that in the 8-K on Brightree, for example, which is the largest acquisition by far, the ratios are not inconsistent with historical, so that will give you at least a sense of it.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yes.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, I want to address, there has been a number of initiatives that have been talked about by the government in terms of being on kind of a watchlist with sleep testing with vents. I guess, is that a risk that you see for any of those parts of your business or do you think this is sort of just normal activity on the part of the government with regard to some of their investigations?
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yes, Matt, look, I think the government has regularly looked at their spending in all parts of healthcare whether it's in pharma, in different areas of med-tech and clearly, this is something that is important to make sure that the government's money is invested well. There are 40 million to 60 million Americans who suffer from sleep apnea and we've only got 6 million of them who are suffocating – 6 million of them on therapy. We need to get to the other tens of millions and it needs to be done appropriately and economically. And we are partnering with every government where we do business to make sure that we can appropriately and economically diagnose and treat those patients and keep them out of the hospital care system because it's much less expensive to have a patient safely breathing at home than badly breathing and needing to visit the ICU or CCU.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the thoughts.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Thank you for taking my question. Sorry to go back to gross margin, but just on the Brightree acquisition, I think previously you've mentioned that that would have added between 70 basis points and 100 basis points. And I'm just comparing that to the actual results this time around, and I know there are multiple factors here but can we – is it possible to sort of get a correlation between what you expected Brightree and what it actually has added this time around to gross margin?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah. Chris, this is Brett. It would be that the Brightree contributed at the top of that range for this quarter.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: So out of the 90 basis points, most of that is Brightree?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: No, there's basically positive and negative, right, so it's going to be – in absolute terms it's going to be, as I said, on top of that range we said I think 70 to 100 and that's towards the top of that range in terms of basis point contribution. But then in case you have any impacts from ASP declines, you have negative impacts from product mix still flowing through. But we had good contributions, very strong contribution from manufacturing procurement improvements and then also Brightree. They're probably the kind of the four big elements that are playing out on the gross margins. So you can't – you've got kind of -it's a mix situation that you end up with.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Sure. So, it's tracking as expected more or less?
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. And Brett, can I just trouble you for the device sales non-U.S? Again, I just missed that number.
Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.: Device sales non-U.S. 6% was the EMEA and APAC constant currency growth.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Yeah.
Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.: Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Marianna. And in closing, I want to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 literally by giving a product that helps the patient who is suffocating or couldn't breathe before, breathe afterwards. Thanks for your time today and we'll talk to you again in 90 days. Agnes?
Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.: Thank you again for joining us today. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com in about two hours. Marianna, you may now close the call. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2016 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Laurel and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Laurel and thank you for attending ResMed’s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we summarize our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region and high single-digit growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions. We closed the Brightree acquisition April 4. So, this is our first quarter that includes revenue and profit contribution from the Brightree suite of software-as-a-service offerings. For the call today, I will first review our high level financial results, I will then outline some regional highlights from our business, and then finally, I will discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. After that, I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. Throughout fiscal year 2016, I have talked about ResMed’s growing global leadership in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This leadership has been a catalyst for strong overall revenue growth and market beating organic revenue growth these last 12 months. We produced robust double-digit growth in the Americas region. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of organic masks and devices growth augmented by new software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We achieved above market growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with the highlight being double-digit growth of our flow generators in the combined EMEA and APAC group. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share, was $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 9% year-on-year growth. In terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew our bottom line at 20% in Q4 on a year-on-year basis. We continue to balance strong revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D and our global focus on operating excellence. We achieved positive operating leverage in SG&A, keeping its growth well below our top line revenue growth. We are investing for the long-term future, maintaining R&D spend at around 7% of top line revenue. These R&D investments will enhance our long-term pipeline of innovation across the portfolios of sleep apnea, COPD and connected care solutions. Now, let me drill into some regional highlights. First, in the Americas region, we had strong sales performance in Q4 with our commercial team driving 11% growth in masks and accessories and 6% growth in devices in the Americas. This latter number was up against a hefty 53% growth comparable from last year. These robust results from the Americas team have the foundation of stable market growth. However, it really shows the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 systems, powered and catalyzed by our cloud-based Air Solutions software platform, including the U-Sleep and myAir applications. These applications are liberating data and unlocking value in terms of actionable information for HME providers and for patients, respectively. The double-digit growth for the masks and accessories category was a great result for the Americas in Q4. We expect solid masks and accessories growth as we move forward with resupply initiatives and new product launches during fiscal year 2017. Turning to the combined EMEA and APAC group. We had strong sales performance in these regions, resulting in 8% growth on a constant currency basis in Q4. We produced solid growth in devices in the region, especially from our sleep apnea platforms. As we discussed last quarter, the ASV growth headwind started to subside mid-Q4, and we will pass the anniversary of the tail of this impact in this current quarter, Q1 fiscal ‘17. We are clearly turning the corner in ASV, and we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead for ASV therapy, particularly for patients with central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea, pain management medication and posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. We are excited to get back to growth on a trajectory for this really innovative, beneficial and high-margin therapy. Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We have made good progress in global leadership for connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have now incorporated into our P&L high-quality, recurring software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We will continue to invest in our portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions to help our HME customers become even more efficient and to help them free up cash flow for even better patient care. We recently announced a new CEO and a new COO for Brightree. Matt Mellott is the new CEO and Bobby Ghoshal is the new COO. Matt’s experience in successfully building and running a multi-state HME that used Brightree as an integral part of that business sets him up as a strong and capable leader for Brightree. Bobby’s experience in running ResMed’s IT team for the Americas sets him up to be a great operating partner together with Matt. So Matt and Bobby, together with the Brightree leadership team, will guide the development and ongoing integration of the Brightree suite of software solutions within and as a part of the Air Solutions platform offerings. The goal is clear to provide enhanced value for HME partners, for physicians, for payers and for patients. With our HME channel partners, our current connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency. They are eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence and improving patient outcomes. We intend to continue to grow our connected care solutions in COPD as well as other chronic care applications as we move forward. This strategic foundation of connected care is an integral part of our current and our future success. Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of our Three Horizons and then hand over to Brett, and then we’ll head on to Q&A. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong, sustained growth since the launch of the Air Solutions platform. While many companies are talking about connected care and digital health, we have executed in connected care, and we lead the market with well over 2 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, sending data to the cloud every day. This is more than double the nearest competitor. We also have over 900 patients each day signing up for our patient engagement application called myAir. Air Solutions not only has millions and millions of patients, it is also connected through APIs to hospital and physician managed electronic medical record systems that allow patients to share data with their caregivers. We are in mile 1 of a marathon of population health management and health care analytics. Through this ecosystem, we are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers. At ResMed, we are a company that is clearly founded on scientific principles of research. During the quarter, Dr. Dennis Hwang of Kaiser Permanente presented results from a large prospective randomized controlled trial at the SLEEP meeting in Denver, Colorado. The Kaiser Permanente study randomized 1,455 patients, and its conclusion was that the use of ResMed’s cloud based algorithm called U-Sleep produced a 21% relative increase in sleep habit adherence. Dr. Hwang was quoted as saying the following: anything that significantly increases CPAP use in the first 90 days is a big deal. That initial period is crucial for patients to embrace CPAP to treat their sleep apnea, which is linked to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and other serious conditions. Tools like U-Sleep hold a lot of promise for patients on CPAP and the clinicians who treat them. We think that’s a great quote. We believe that U-Sleep and the broader Air Solutions platform is a huge value to Kaiser Permanente as well as other payer provider models in the U.S. and around the world, including ACOs, IDNs and many government run payer provider models as they look for ways to take better care of patients and essentially to keep their patients out of high cost hospitals and to treat them with high quality and great care in the concerns of their own home. With the close of the Brightree acquisition in Q4, we have augmented Air Solutions to create an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for HME customers. We will continue to help our HME partners drive even more efficiencies in their businesses and also continue to invest in market development of new channels for the software-as-a-service offerings of Brightree in home health, home nursing as well as in the hospice channel. Watch this space. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we have continued the integration process at Inova, which is the portable oxygen concentrator company we acquired in Q3. We have completed the integration of our commercial sales and marketing teams and we are now leveraging our global manufacturing, quality and product development expertise to take Inova to the next level. We clearly have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels and we will prioritize the 100 countries where we sell so as to maximize physician, provider and patient value throughout fiscal year 2017 and beyond. We will create next generation Inova products that provide not only a step up in quality, but also to leverage our global connected care leadership in this space. The strategy is to leverage connected care solutions for COPD across a broad portfolio of offerings, including life support ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and now portable oxygen concentrators. This spectrum of respiratory care products will help patients with neuromuscular diseases like ALS as well as normocapnic COPD and hypercapnic COPD patients. With COPD being the number three cause of death in the Western world and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the West, we know connected care will play a big role in the future. This quarter, we announced that we are adding a ResMed communication module, essentially a wireless communication module, to our life support ventilator, Astral. There will be more to come on this front. Along with our product strategies in this space, we are driving market channel strategies. In Q4, we announced a group purchasing organization, or GPO contract, to enable 3,600 member hospitals and 120,000 other providers to purchase and use ResMed’s best-in-class respiratory care products and services as patients move from the hospital to in-home care. As I noted just a moment ago, there will be more to come on this front as we continue to execute against this part of our strategy. Our third horizon of growth, includes a robust portfolio of long-term opportunities in new markets, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and sleep wellness. During the quarter, clinical trial results from the CAT-HF trial were presented at the annual Heart Failure Congress at the European Society of Cardiology or ESC. The overall CAT-HF study results were neutral. However, a pre-specified subgroup of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint for this study was a combined measure of mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of the patient. This study, CAT-HF, is the first study globally to show that addressing sleep disordered breathing with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation may improve cardiovascular outcomes, heart outcomes for people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. We expect full publication of the CAT-HF study shortly and we are very excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization and re-hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally. Returning to our financial results, we have been able to put our balance sheet to work this fiscal year. We have invested $1 billion into high quality acquisitions that clearly drive us towards our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. You will see us laser focused on ensuring we get return on capital for these investments. Our Board has increased the dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our long-term strategy and our ability to drive ongoing cash flow from the business. Given our significant capital deployment this year, we believe it is prudent to continue to temporarily suspend our share repurchase program. It is important to note that we reserve the right to resume the share buyback program at any time in the future as conditions warrant. Let me close with this. In fiscal year 2016, we established ourselves as the global leader in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This is only strengthened by our acquisition of Brightree. We have added essential building blocks for our global cardio respiratory care strategy, particularly in connected care for COPD. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners and most importantly, for millions and millions of patients around the world. With that, I will hand the call over to Brett, who is in Sydney for his comments, over to you, Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our acquisition this fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid finish to the year. Group revenue for the June quarter was $518.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 8% over the prior year quarter and excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $295.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pac totaled $194.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific also increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $161 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $134.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pac, device sales were $133.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $60.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, also an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. I would now like to provide some additional information about the Brightree revenue contribution. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $28.9 million. On a pro forma full quarter basis, Brightree’s revenue would have been $32.2 million. This represents the most relevant measure of Brightree’s fourth quarter revenue run rate. The difference in our reported revenue and pro forma revenue is related to two items. First, a one-time $2.3 million fair value adjustment to Brightree’s deferred revenue balances required under U.S. GAAP purchase accounting rules and second, the pro forma revenue of $32.2 million for the quarter includes a few days revenue that was not included in reported revenue due to the close of the Brightree acquisition on April 4. As it relates to acquisitions, during the quarter we also incurred $1.9 million in acquisition and integration related expenses associated with the Inova and Brightree acquisition. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted for the impact of acquisition and integration expenses associated with our acquisitions of Brightree and Inova, the amortization of acquired intangibles, the Brightree acquisition of one-time deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. In the prior year comparable, that excludes the SERVE-HF accrual, amortization of acquired intangibles and the donation for UCSD and the ResMed Foundation. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margins declined by 20 basis points, reflecting typical declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix, essentially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, largely attributable to the Brightree acquisition and a more consistent product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue to be in a range of 57% to 60% for fiscal year 2017. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $133.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.8% compared to 27.2% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 24%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year ago figure of 6.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $12.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.6 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $135.1 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $104.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $83.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.74, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard that was issued in the U.S. called ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. As a result of adopting this standard, we have recognized the full year tax benefit of $11.2 million and this provided us with an opportunity to increase our foreign cash repatriation to the U.S. with the additional tax expense largely offsetting the tax benefit. With this adoption and the increase in cash repatriation, our full year effective tax rate remained relatively consistent at 19.8% compared to the prior year tax rate of 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, we have reflected full year tax benefit from the adoption of this standard within our tax expense for the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%. Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $27 million. For fiscal year 2016, we generated record operating cash flow of $547.9 million, an increase of 43% over the prior fiscal year. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the June quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of June, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $444 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains modestly geared and very strong. At June 30, total assets were $3.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Laurel, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my question. I was just wondering if you are willing to tell us something about your new mask range, we have seen the 510(k) there and perhaps if you are not willing go into too much detail whether you are willing to talk about the opportunity to evolve the business model with the AirSense 10 and the connectivity piece?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Andrew. You are right in your caveat around the question, but we – for competitive reasons, we don’t think it benefits shareholder value to go into the details of product timing and product launches. But as you noted, there is some activity there in 510(k)s and we do plan to launch at least one new mask before the end of the calendar year and that’s all the information I will give on that. But in terms of your second part of your question, which was about connectivity and how we can use the fantastic ecosystem of connectivity that we have and the installed base of 2 million cloud-connected medical devices to interact with patients and the myAir application, where patients are connected directly to the cloud, we think it’s great to liberate these data and then to provide actionable information to patients. We think patients should know how long they have had their mask and when it’s time to replace their mask and we are seeing patients really engage in that. So we do think there is a strong link to that. And I think if you look at this quarter, where we saw 11% growth in masks and accessories in the Americas, clearly we have patients engaging on that front, more to come on new products and more to come on engaging patients over fiscal year ‘17.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Andrew.
Operator: Next online, we have Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the questions. A couple of things, Australian dollar has been up and down a little bit, but mostly down, how do we think about that impact for next year’s gross margins?
Mick Farrell: I will hand that question over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks Joanne. Yes. If you looked at it sort of year-on-year sort of Q4, we did see some, a little bit of benefit from FX in particular the Aussie. Going forward into FY ‘17, we have seen more recently, I guess that’s sort of bit of an up-tick in Australian dollar, it strengthened a little bit against the U.S. dollar. So in that context if you look at it sequentially into Q1, that’s probably around a 50 basis point headwind for us on the gross margin there, at least in this kind of the near-term. Longer term I guess, it depends where the Aussie dollar goes, but short-term, probably a little bit of a headwind, but you would have to think longer term, it should be still be beneficial for us with the Aussie, but it has strengthened recently and we really don’t know where that’s going to go.
Joanne Wuensch: Okay. And can you just take a bigger step back and talk about the sleep apnea landscape, how it may be changing competitively, one of your comments talked about some pressure on average selling prices, so anything as it relates to pricing or products would be appreciated? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Joanne. Well, the whole sleep industry landscape has changed fundamentally, I would say in these last 18 months since we launched, 18-plus months since we launched, approaching 24 months since we launched Air Solutions. And the basis of competition in the space is now changed to be not only do the devices have to be quieter, smaller, more comfortable, but they also have to be more connected. And we think that connectivity has really changed the space. It’s meant that we are able to take waste out to increase adherence of patients and to remove some of the inefficient steps in the value chain and therefore extract some value for our partners our HME partners, our patient partners, our physician partners and also ourselves out of that. And so there is some mitigation of some of the historic price impacts. We don’t go into details on that, but at a high level, I think that shift to value from price discussions has been a really beneficial one for us and our partners and the whole industry in general.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Great. My first one will be for Brett, just some of the moving parts on the tax line and maybe can you walk us through the benefit of the ASU, but also the additional tax expense that you incurred from the repatriation of foreign cash and just how much foreign cash was repatriated in the quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I will give you a sense. So we did adopt that standard and what we did, I guess is we took that opportunity to increase cash repatriation and the tax expense associated with that largely offset that benefit. So you saw in our full year tax rate, it was pretty consistent with what we saw last year. To give you an idea on the repatriation, if you look at – we basically repatriated an additional $60 million this year compared to what we did last year, so quite significant for us. So we felt that, that was the best thing to do and just take the opportunity, I guess that would be implementation of the standard. So overall, if you kind of looked at our overall full year tax rate and tax rates going forward, I think it will continue to be pretty consistent.
Anthony Petrone: Okay, great, that’s helpful. And maybe my follow-up would just be back on pricing a bit and maybe just a little bit more details on underlying pricing in sleep, specifically it relates to the competitive landscape, we did some checks earlier in the quarter and our understanding is Respironics came in with more of a price discount since the beginning of the year and additionally, we are hearing 3B Medical is sort of out there with more aggressive pricing, so any comments there would be helpful? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don’t go into particular details about competitor A or competitor B. I will reiterate what I said before a little bit and I will maybe give to Jim Hollingshead, our President, Americas, to give a little more color and detail around the U.S. environment. But at a high level, I think the shift to value and the shift to talk about how much data you are extracting from devices, how you are getting that data into my customer, who for our customer, their customer is either the hospital or the physician or even the payer. And by providing those data, we are extracting value for their customer and their customers’ customer. So you are sort of changing the conversation from a pure price one to a value one. And if your box is X dollars cheaper, but the value provided is X plus, then the discussion goes back to the value side of it. But with that as a prelude, Jim any further comments on pricing?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure. I think everybody is aware that the big driver of pricing in the U.S. market has been ongoing Medicare changes to reimbursement and that’s pressure that the market has been under for several months through the competitive bidding process. I think our results in Q4 show that our Air Solutions offers or our AirSense and AirCurve devices coupled with our software platforms create a lot of value. So we – our revenue grew against a huge Q4 comp last year precisely because we have really shifted, as Mick said just earlier, we have really shifted the nature of what we are doing with our HME customers to allow them to create more value out of their business. So our offerings allow them to increase their revenue and cut their operating costs and that’s why our offerings have held up so well over the course of the year and continue to maintain share and volume growth.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Anthony.
Operator: Next, we have Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sean Laaman: Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Brightree, you have owned it for one quarter now, I don’t know Mick, if you could give us a sense on the retention of existing customers and the uptake of new ones, just some commentary around there to give us something to work with would be fantastic?
Mick Farrell: Sure Sean. Thanks for the question. Yes. So we are 90-days plus into the close of Brightree and beyond that from the announcement. And I can tell you these first three months or four months have been a really smooth transition. We have seen great contributions from Dave Cormack, the CEO, in this transition and the new appointment of Matt Mellott as the CEO. And apart of the – directly after the announcement, which was four months or five months ago that we announced the acquisition, there was a series of phone calls and I might hand it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the details. But Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas, and Raj Sodhi, who runs our global – is the President of our global business unit for healthcare informatics, along with Dave Cormack called all the top customers and individually spoke to them both in our core HME space and in the Brightree space and had really good discussions with them about what we were trying to do with this acquisition, which is help them and reinvest with them to take costs and waste out and to improve patient adherence and have better flow of data through the industry and extract value for all the partners. The conversations I had, which were with a small subset of those customers were very positive and we have seen very good customer retention. In fact no significant change in customer retention pre or post the announcement or the close of the acquisition on both the core business and on Brightree. But Jim, you were involved in a lot more of those calls, do you want to provide some more color for Sean?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks Mick. Sean, we have had by and large, very favorable responses from customers, whether they were individual customers on both sides, whether ResMed customer or Brightree customer or whether they were shared customers and there are several hundred shared customers out in the world. Initially, we had terrific conversations with customers and I think that the response has held up over time. We have maintained virtually all of our customer relationships with both businesses and any concerns that customers had about how the two units work together have been, I think have been effectively addressed both by the fact that we have kept Brightree operating as a separate commercial unit, separate sales force, etcetera and just in conversations that we have had. If I just go back quickly to one of the rationales for the acquisition was we were already working together out in the world making our customers business process is more streamlined. So we had data connections that were allowing an HME – so for example, in sleep, if you set up a patient on a ResMed flow gen, you could import all of the same data into the Brightree application and will go straight into our compliance applications with the click of a button. That kind of labor savings made a big difference. And I think customers see what we are trying to do, which is to extend our health informatics offering from the therapy into their back-office operations and just continue to add value by taking out costs and streamlining their business. And I think the customer response has by and large been very, very favorable.
Sean Laaman: Great. Thank you, Jim. And just one quick follow-up, is there any reason for perhaps seasonality in the revenue for Brightree?
Mick Farrell: Why don’t I hand that over to Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks Mick. Yes. Sean, that – I mean, it’s very much a subscription model. So you would certainly, from that perspective, you certainly get much less seasonality. So it’s less of an impact than it would be, for example, for our kind of core existing business, so less seasonality due to the subscription model.
Sean Laaman: As I hope, Brett. Thank you. And thank you Mick. And that’s all the questions I have.
Mick Farrell: Thanks a lot Sean.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon. I guess maybe a question for Brett to try to be direct, can you give us a sense of what the tax hit was for the $60 million of extra repatriation and because you keep saying largely offset, but can you be more precise?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. I mean well, to that extent it did largely offset that side, so a slightly smaller number, but not – it’s around that number.
Ben Andrew: So very close to the actual incremental...
Brett Sandercock: It’s around that sort of $9 million, $10 million mark on the repatriation.
Ben Andrew: Okay. Thank you for that. That’s very helpful, Brett. And I guess the second question for me, as we look at the Brightree revenues, the $32.2 million, is – what growth rate does that represent year-over-year and how do you think about the sustainability of that growth rate or what should we be looking for, for the business in the next balance of the fiscal year?
Mick Farrell: Yes. Thanks Ben. It’s Mick here. One of the beauties of recurring software-as-a-service business model that Brightree has established over these last 7 years, 8 years, 9 years since they have been in business is that it’s 80, 90-plus percent recurring revenue. And so you see a really steady flow, to Sean’s question, proves a really steady flow, not much seasonality and sort of building up of per customer, per user, per member, per month, if you like, per user per month type of revenue models and they build up over time. We have seen really solid double-digit growth in Brightree year-on-year to get to where they are now and we expect to continue to do that. We really like the Brightree model. We really like what value it provides in the core business, which is its HME channel and partnership business. One of the upsides I alluded to in the prepared remarks, but I think related to your question there about growth and future growth is home nursing, home health and hospice channels, these two – as our population ages in the West and it’s particularly focused on the U.S. market for this, there are some really exciting software-as-a-service revenue models, including iPad applications for home nurses directly entering data in the home that goes directly to the cloud, efficiency savings that are well ahead of the competition and really value that we can help extract for us and from new channel partners. And there is an upside for us and that there may be a large chunk of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD and untreated sleep apnea and COPD amongst those two channels. So there is sort two levels of upside. One is the core business is software-as-a-service and Brightree revenue in those two new channels, but secondly identifying patients for our core business in sleep apnea and our growing business in COPD.
Ben Andrew: Great. And just to be again direct Mick, is that mid-teens growth for Brightree or is it lower than that, higher than that? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. It’s going to be around that mid-teens number. Brett, you want to go into any further detail on that or are we good with that?
Brett Sandercock: No, that’s right, Mick. It’s definitely tracking along mid-teens.
Ben Andrew: Thanks guys.
Mick Farrell: Thanks a lot Ben.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Mick, maybe just one question, I wonder if you could talk to what you see as an industry growth rate, you have mentioned this in the past on previous quarters, where you think the industry is growing maybe in the U.S. and then rest of the world, just in a sense are you going ahead of markets, what do you – where do you see industry growth rates across the two key regions that you participate in? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yes. Look – thanks for the question, Saul. We think the market growth rate for the markets that we play in is in that mid to high single-digits revenue range globally. And so we think hitting that 8% constant currency growth in EMEA and APAC we are slightly ahead of market growth there. We think we took some share in that sort of combined sleep and respiratory care space. And if you look at excluding Brightree, the core Americas business, excluding Brightree grew at 8% as well. And so again, I would say we are taking some share there, not a huge amount of share, but taking some share and against a very tough comparable from Q4 last year. We think that’s a pretty good performance. And as we look forward, that’s our goal, right. We don’t accept market growth. We like to drive market growth. We like to have innovations that create opportunities for us to grow ahead of the curve and so we don’t give guidance as you know, but we see the market growing in that mid to high single-digits and we like to meet or beat on a regular basis.
Saul Hadassin: Alright. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Saul.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ian Abbott: Hi guys. Good morning. One thing, when you speak to DMEs, one of their focuses is on re-supply and they are focusing on trying to ship more accessories with masks and I am just wondering, from your perspective, how far do you think there is to go on this. And secondly, with your solutions with connectivity, how is that helping them?
Mick Farrell: So good question Ian, I will do the first part and then hand over to Jim for some further details on the Americas and what we are doing in re-supply. As a personal user of an AirSense 10 device and an AirFit P10 mask, I like to change my mask on a regular sort of three monthly basis. Any patient who puts a piece of plastic on their face every day and wears it for six hour, seven hours I think would find that a hygienic and an appropriate thing to do. The numbers out there in the industry are far below that, well below that sort of 4x replacement per year. In fact I think there was some data from some governments showing around 1.8, 1.9 masks per year, which would mean lasting 6.5 months. Personally, I think there is a lot of runway as patients get more engaged with high deductible health plans and health savings accounts in the U.S. and take more control of their own healthcare, but they will invest the co-pay dollars or even full cash pay to receive that dot com type payments to get themselves involved in this as the deductibles go up and so on. But I am just talking from a personal patient experience. Jim, why don’t you give sort of the broader U.S. market thought on that?
Jim Hollingshead: Thanks Mick and thanks for the question, Ian. The first thing I would say is, just as Mick is relating his own experience, it’s really important to remember that we have a very firm belief that re-supply is very good for patients. The experience of therapy for patients is always made better by fresh equipment. Equipment does wear out, it gets old, etcetera. And so when the experience with therapy is better it leads to better adherence and just better long-term health for the patient. So – and that’s one of the reasons I think both ResMed and our customers seek to drive re-supply. It also happens to be good obviously for our customers business. We have been working with customers for years to help them to understand how to efficiently re-supply patients. And with the advent of our Air Solutions offering, we have been able to provide some software platforms that help to automate that process. And as a reminder, we actually have two platforms now with the acquisition of Brightree. We have a platform called ResMed ReSupply, which is a platform we built out of the acquisitions of CareTouch and Jaysec previously. And that’s an automated re-supply platform that has both a software component and a call center live call and automated call component. And then Brightree has a platform called Connect, which is also an automated re-supply platform. Both of them create a lot of value for our HME customers because it allows them to re-supply in a very cost efficient, cost effective way. And we have seen very good growth, both in terms of number of customers joining these platforms and grow the re-supply through them over the course of the year and that’s an ongoing phenomenon for us. So our customers are enjoying the benefits of it. It has helped our re-supply numbers obviously, so our accessory sales. And it helps patients. Patients love getting fresh equipment on an appropriate basis because it improves their quality of therapy, their quality of life.
Ian Abbott: Alright. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Ian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.
Matt Taylor: Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, okay.
Mick Farrell: Yes.
Matt Taylor: So I just wanted to cover one thing with the gross margin, previously you had said that Brightree was going to add about 70 bps to 100 bps, is that about what you saw in the quarter and is that what we should think about as kind of the contribution for the next year?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Hi Matt. The Q4, it came pretty much in middle levels – it was 80 basis points that it contributed. And then look going forward I think I would stick with that range around that sort of 70 basis points to 100 basis points.
Matt Taylor: Okay. And I guess with the moving parts that you alluded to before the Aussie dollars you talked about but also euro is going down, how does that factor into your guidance for GMs for next year, so what are you assuming?
Mick Farrell: Alright. Matt, I apologize. I missed the first half of that question.
Matt Taylor: Yes. I am just asking with the euro as well, euro is a little bit weaker in recent weeks, how are you thinking about those two major currencies for gross margin next year?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. I mean that plays into I think – we talked about that a little earlier on. Just for – it does, I mean obviously, a weaker euro, a weaker pound or whatever it might be doesn’t impact us there. If I looked at it just at least in this sort of near-term into Q1 with that sort of strengthening of Aussie and probably some weakening in some of the European currencies, we – I think all up probably at the moment, estimates probably a 50 basis point headwind for us going into Q1 and now it’s just a question of, I guess then if currencies stay where they are from thereon in that you wouldn’t see any further impact on a sequential basis. We might see a little bit on a year-on-year basis, but pretty volatile at the moment. So it’s hard to say on that, but near-term, I would say it’s about 50 basis points and of course that can change depending on what currencies do. But at the moment, I will put it around that kind of number.
Matt Taylor: Great. And then can you just give us a sense of how to model the interest and other expense for next year, since you have the debt from Brightree, I think due to modeling some income, you had some expense this quarter, any parameters you can give us around the interest rate or the – your cadence of the debt pay-down to help with that number?
Mick Farrell: Matt, the interest rate for us would be around – is rough number around that 2% mark in terms of funding costs on the interest – if you use that. Had Brightree basically the acquisition from close to the beginning of the quarter and I think we finished with kind of this net interest expense for the quarter around $2.4 million. So it’s probably kind of a reasonable go forward number going into FY ‘17.
Matt Taylor: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.
Steve Wheen: Yes. Hi guys. Just a quick question on that GPO announcement that you made, are there any milestones in terms of volumes that are required and is there any sort of color you can give around how that will contribute going forward. And then just if we could Brett, go sort of talk on the gross margin outlook for FY ‘17 you have mentioned FX and you have mentioned Brightree, but just any other sort of moving parts that we should be mindful of? Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions. Steve I will answer the first one and as you indicated, I will hand it to Brett for the second. The GPO announcement was really as an example of us executing on that channel strategy and you may or may not see further press releases from us about other GPO and government contracts that we have over time, but we don’t give details of any particular customer and milestones associated with them on a sort of milestone basis. Essentially these GPO contracts are hunting licenses and then you are allowed to go in hospital-by-hospital and move forward on it, but it’s an upfront negotiated air cover for the sales folks to go in there and work with those 3,600 hospitals and 120,000 other providers and push forward on our respiratory care growth within the channel. So I said in my prepared remarks, more to come on that front. There will be a lot more to come. We might not put press releases out on all of them. It was really just an indicator of where we are moving on that front. Brett, do you wanted to take the second question about gross margin?
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Yes. Steve, on the outlook there on gross margin, I guess as you know, there is a lot of moving parts on that. We have mentioned on FX if I look at certainly from a product mix perspective, it’s definitely that sort of unfavorable mix is certainly moderated for us. It’s far more consistent to the extent and Mick mentioned earlier in terms of new mask introduction and so on, you could probably expect that would be supportive on a product mix front as we get through FY ‘17. We have done – the team has been doing some really good work around the manufacturing procurement and so on. We have seen some of that come through. So I am quite positive on that. And then you have got, obviously the Brightree is now kind of built into that Q4 margin, but that will continue to be supportive as well. I mean you have the usual ASP declines and things like that coming through. But overall, in the mix I think some of the big unfavorable items are certainly moderating and potentially could have – as masks are introduced and so on, that should be beneficial. So overall, we have got – it’s probably a near-term currency headwind that’s a bit unhelpful. But overall, pretty comfortable with that 57% to 60% range and we are kind of more or less just about right in the midpoint of that range at the moment. So that’s kind of how I would characterize the moving pieces.
Steve Wheen: Great. Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the questions Steve.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Chris Kallos with Morningstar. Your line is open.
Chris Kallos: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the cardiology trial Mick, from the sound of your – of the CAT-HF numbers, they are neutral to positive, does that now maybe reboot your efforts in cardiology and are you planning any more sponsoring of clinical trials in that space?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Chris. That allows us to talk to our sort of third horizon portfolio if you like. And we are absolutely dedicated to cardio-respiratory care since it’s almost – I am not sure it’s a medical term out there in the formal literature, it’s something that we are really leading the market on and I would define it as sleep disordered breathing amongst atrial fibrillation, sleep disordered breathing amongst heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. And I would also include some play in hypertension and some other cardiovascular diseases. But clearly, the data from CAT-HF were incredibly exciting. I don’t know if you had a look at the detail that was presented there at ESC or the Heart Failure Congress at ESC. But as you start to look at those clinical data and the level of clinical and statistical significance from a relatively small group of patients, it certainly indicates to us and if you talk to Chris O’Connor, who is the primary investigator who was formerly at Duke and is still the PI on the trial, clearly our investigators in all the hospitals and all the clinicians involved want to do some follow-on work in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction space. So it certainly gives me more excitement in the space. The clinicians are very excited about it, the nurses, the doctors and we would like to continue to invest in the space. And so we won’t go into details about what an investment will look like large multi-year clinical trials or a lot of market development work or some combination of the above. But you will hear a lot more from us regarding that Horizon 3 growth opportunity, including the CAT-HF trial and follow-up in the coming quarters.
Chris Kallos: Mick, just on that, is the data strong enough to incorporate into marketing to cardiologists and also these initiatives, are they in the next 2 years in terms of next steps, is that the sort of timeframe we are talking about?
Mick Farrell: So the data are not strong enough for an indication for use or IFU to start marketing to cardiologists. So no, it would require a lot further work on that front. What you might see is some work with – we talked about that trial with Kaiser Permanente, where we did some work on U-Sleep. We might work with payer providers, who are looking at these clinical data saying that’s exciting, we would like to work on that in some sort of IRB or other controlled environment. But yes, I don’t want to go into sort of real details here on the final question of our Q&A about what that part of Horizon 3 will look like at this point, but what I will say Chris is you will hear more from us over the coming quarters as to what we are doing in the cardio-respiratory care space, but it’s pretty exciting data from CAT-HF. I am glad you noticed that.
Chris Kallos: Great. Thanks Mick.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Chris. May be one last question?
Operator: Yes, of course. Your next question comes from the line of Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Will Dunlop: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could please give more detail on your rest of the world flow gens growth and what countries perhaps and what products are driving good 11% growth there? Please.
Mick Farrell: So I will hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO to talk about EMEA and APAC.
Rob Douglas: Yes. Will, thanks for that question. We – as you saw, we reported pretty good results through there. We are not going to break it up by country, but we saw good continued take-up of the AirSense platform. We had previously talked about the value proposition really came on very strong, but it’s been a little more work to get that value proposition going in some of the other countries. And we are very pleased with the progress going through there. And so we are really seeing good take-up across the board with that. So it’s really been a good result.
Will Dunlop: Okay. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks a lot for your question, Will.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: So in closing, I would like to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. I am really proud of what the team accomplished, not just here in Q4, but throughout the whole fiscal 2016 to establish ResMed really as the world’s leading tech-driven medical device company. Through clinical research, new features that expand our products and solutions and our acquisitions, we are transforming how healthcare is delivered and shaping a new frontier in connected care in respiratory medicine. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days. I will hand back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, everyone, again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website in about two hours at investors.resmed.com. Laurel, you may now close the call.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2016 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Andrew and thank you for attending ResMed’s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance.  We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the filings made by ResMed with the SEC.  I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we summarize our results for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region. We made progress executing on our respiratory care strategy by closing our acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter.  We also made significant progress executing on our connected care strategy by closing our acquisition of Brightree on April 4. For the call today, I’ll first review our top and bottom-line results. I’ll then outline some regional highlights from our business, and finally, I’ll review our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. After that I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financials in greater detail.  We have seen strong ongoing success with our global leadership in connected care. For the seventh quarter in a row, our global team achieved market beating topline revenue growth. We exhibited continued strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 12% year-on-year. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud based connected care software system, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms.  We achieved steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions, despite the headwind for macroeconomic conditions in Europe. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings-per-share was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth. We continue to balance solid revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D innovation and our global focus on operating excellence. This quarter we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our topline revenue growth.  We are investing for the future, maintaining R&D spend at 6% to 7% of our topline revenue. These R&D investments are focused on enhancing our growing portfolio of sleep apnea, COPD, and connected care solutions. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region we had very strong sales performance in Q3 with our commercial team in that region driving 12% growth against very tough year-on-year comparables. Flow generator growth was 15% in the Americas reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, our AirCurve 10 platforms, but all powered by our cloud based Air Solutions software including the U-Sleep and myAir apps.  The mask and accessories category also grew very well, we have achieved double-digit growth for the last three quarters in this category with 10% growth in the Americas for Q3 in masks and accessories. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth as we move forward. We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw solid growth in sleep apnea platforms and our respiratory care offerings in the regions. It is important to note that the ASV growth headwind from the SERVE-HF announcement in 2015 was significant on a year-on-year basis in Q3. The studies announcement anniversary is May 13, 2016, so we will pass that date in just a few weeks here, after which, those headwinds will begin to subside. ASV growth will remain an issue in Q4 with the largest impact on the EMEA and APAC region. We continue to see opportunities for ASV in central sleep apnea, especially in those patients with complex sleep apnea, with pain management medication and also with posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. These all provide a basis for very good growth in ASV for 2017 and beyond.  Now, I would like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We're making good progress with all three foundations that allow us to drive our strategy. As a reminder, these three foundations are, one our global leadership in healthcare informatics; two, our investment and expansion in high-growth geographic markets; and three, a strong focus on best-in-class talent development, as well as global excellence. We continue to make great progress with our global leadership in healthcare informatics. This is truly a core competence for ResMed team and a source of sustainable competitive advantage. With the close of the Brightree acquisition we're continuing to invest in cloud-based computing solutions. These solutions help make our customers more efficient and help them free up cash flow to invest in even better patient care.  With well over 1 million cloud connected medical devices sending data every morning to the cloud, we are the world's leading tech driven medical device company. With the addition of the Brightree suite of software solutions we're building an end-to-end solutions offering that provides value for HME, physicians, payers, and for patients. With our channel partners we are improving operational efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence, and improving patient outcomes.  We intend to grow our connected care solutions into COPD, as well as other chronic care applications as we continue to execute on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Our second foundation is our investment and expansion in high-growth geographies. Our investment in China with Curative is an example of this strategy in action.  Curative is strategically aligned and integrating well with our ResMed China business. Curative has very high quality products that are developed in China, made in China, and sold in China. Curative opens up channels that just aren’t available for foreign made products. We are now leveraging the distribution capabilities of both organizations. We will continue to invest and expand our presence in China and other global high-growth markets including Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe.  In each geography, the value we deliver is to improve patient quality of life, to improve objective patient outcomes and to reduce national healthcare costs in key chronic diseases. Our third foundation is operating excellence with a focus on developing the best-in-class talent and leveraging our market-leading style. We hire and develop the best talent in the industry. The leadership team that Rob and I have assembled is a key part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. On the operational front, we continue to create efficiencies that allow us to free up cash to reinvest in key innovative R&D programs and also to better unlock value from our acquisitions. We are committed to continue growing operating profit ensuring that we have headroom to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth. These strong foundations are critical to allow us to achieve our ResMed 2020 growth goals. Before handing over to Brett, I would like to take a few minutes to update you on some key milestones of progress against our three horizons growth strategy.  In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong sustained growth these last seven quarters. 18 months after the launch of the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and our Air Solutions platform's, we have truly changed the basis of competition in our core market from smaller quieter and more comfortable devices to smaller, quieter, more comfortable devices, but also more connected solutions.  While many companies are talking about connected care and talking about digital health, we have executed in connected care and we lead the market with well over 1 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sending data to the cloud every morning. We are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, for physicians, for providers and even for payers. With the cloud-based software solution we’re able to add enhancements every couple of weeks, every couple of months, to improve the efficiency of our customers and provide benefits to the whole value chain and especially patients. We continue to integrate to EMR and each EHR systems through the ResMed data exchange. And we recently added functionality within AirView, U-Sleep, and our newest ResMed mask text coaching program that provides daily coaching texts for patients, especially those who are brand new to therapy. With the Brightree acquisition we have augmented the Air Solutions platform with an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for our customers. On the market access front, there was a study published on the results of the first large-scale employer program to screen, diagnose, and monitor OSA treatment adherence in the U. S. trucking industry. The study concluded that drivers who were diagnosed and were adherent to our OSA therapy had reduced accident risks, similar to the control group.  However, drivers who had not adhered to OSA therapy had a five-fold, that is a five-fold greater preventable crash risk. There is clearly a long road to fully develop regulations in this transportation sector and we’ve been working on this for a number of years, however, this type of clinical evidence of the risks to human life and major costs for the transportation sector are very important steps in the progress. In addition, this quarter the largest study in the history of sleep apnea was published by the European respiratory society. The study looked at the effect of gender and age on the co-morbidity burden of obstructive sleep apnea across a group of 1.7 million patients. The study concluded that type II diabetes, stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and depression were all more prevalent in patients with OSA when compared to the control group, regardless of gender. Bottom line, these data reiterate that sleep apnea remains a huge public health problem and that women are significantly at risk, not just the stereo typical men. And a key milestone of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy we closed the acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter. With this acquisition we have expanded our COPD offering to include portable oxygen concentrators or POC’s. POC’s enable patient mobility. This fits very well with the key value proposition of our life support ventilation platform Astral. They both give increased mobility and freedom back to the COPD patient.  We have started the integration progress at Inova and we are excited to add these products into our respiratory care portfolio. We have opportunities to grow revenue by filling POC's through our global market channels. We will prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into to maximize physician provider and patient value. We will also be able to bring our global operational and technological capability to create true economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing, and in logistics.  We will create mix generation Inova products that not only take quality to the next level for the platform, but that also leverage our health care informatics leadership. The strategy is to create connected care solutions for COPD with POC's, life support ventilation, and noninvasive ventilation. Given that we have already created connected care solutions for sleep apnea, we know we can execute to this plan. Midway through the quarter a study was published on overlap syndrome, which as a reminder is a cohort of patients who suffer from both sleep apnea and COPD. The study showed that early diagnosis and adherent treatment of sleep apnea in patients admitted with acute COPD exacerbation both reduces hospital readmissions and reduces emergency room visits over a period of six months.  The study also projected that these benefits would persist over 12 months. This is great news for patients, hospitals, physicians, and payers. Under the new reimbursement models everyone in the value chain, including hospitals wants to keep COPD patients out of hospitals and in their home and happy. Our ResMed products and solutions will be a key part of this. Our third horizon of growth includes a robust portfolio of opportunities in new markets, including a trial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. We expect to have some exciting clinical data on our third horizon of growth next quarter. I do not want to steal the thunder from the researchers, so for now I’ll just say watch this space. Returning back to our financial results for the quarter, we’ve been able to put our balance sheet to work with the completion of the Inova Labs acquisition and just a few weeks ago, the Brightree acquisition. We have continued our dividend program and for now we have held back our share repurchase program. We believe this approach is prudent given that we have taken on an additional $725 million worth of debt to fund our acquisition of Brightree. It is important to note that we may resume the share buyback program without prior notice in the near future as conditions warrant. Let me close with this, we're the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly with game changing innovation in both products and solutions for the future of connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly the patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for more a detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $453.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 9%. Movements in exchange rates, predominately a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by approximately $6.3 million in the third quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $282.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.7 million, consistent with the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EME and Asia Pacific increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $153.2 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $129 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our Inova sales are included with flow generators under the advised revenue category. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $116.7 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year and in constant currency terms an increase of 3%. Masks and other sales were $55 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 10% while masks and other increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred acquisition related expenses of $3.6 million associated with the Inova Labs and Brightree acquisitions. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the acquisition related expenses as well as the amortization acquired in intangibles both in the current year and last year. We reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter press release. Gross margin for the March quarter was 57.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 220 basis points reflecting the impact of changes in product mix, declines in average selling prices and changes in geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. We estimate the recent Brightree acquisition will have a positive impact of 70 basis points to 100 basis points on our gross margin and with this impact combined with current exchange rates, unlikely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin to continue to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $119.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26.3% compared to the year ago figure of 27.5%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.2% compared to the year ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.6 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior year amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.9 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 will be in the vicinity of 20%. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $112.4 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $95.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $88.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.63. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar partially offset by the weaker euro. Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $19.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the March quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of March, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Inova Labs effective January 29. The acquisition was funded by drilling on our existing credit facility. Additionally, this month, we announced the close of the Brightree acquisition effective April 04. Brightree will be included in our consolidated results in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The $800 million acquisition was funded by utilizing $75 million in existing cash, relishing a $300 million term line and drilling down funds from our revolving credit facility. Note we have also increased our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion. At the close of the Brightree acquisition, we have approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Post acquisition, our balance sheet remains modestly great and very strong. Total assets are approximately $3.3 billion and net equity is approximately $1.7 billion.  And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Andrew, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.
Ian Abbott: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the gross margin, it certainly stepped down again this quarter, you did call out the impact of ASV. I am just wondering why that was particularly an impact this quarter given it would also have been an impact in the prior two quarters.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Ian. There is a number of factors as you know that go into gross margin. One of the impacts is that the ASV as you talked about. If you remember 12 months ago in March 2015, there was the American College of Cardiology and there was a lot of very positive press around heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and ASV, and we really saw those very high margin ASV products this time a year ago do incredibly well in the March quarter, and so we are annualizing if you like a steeper curve on ASV from a year ago and that headwind. And as I say the endpoint of that is the announcement is May 13, 2016 when we annualize that, so there will be six weeks in Q4 with that steep curve as well. That is one factor. Another factor impacting gross margin was the outperformance of our Americas team, which is lower than group margin but still very positive gross profit dollars but lower than group margin and the other impact was the outperformance of our flow generator line. So the AirSense 10, and the AirCurve 10, which were lower than group margins but very positive products as a platform together in flow generators and those were outperforming the market and outperforming the rest of the business and so had an impact on GM.
Ian Abbott: Okay. And then as a follow-up, you also talk about average selling prices and that’s always a feature of the industry but if you could perhaps comment just on what you are seeing there both in the U.S. and also rest of the world.
Mick Farrell: Yes, look, the pricing environment is pretty normal. As you know, Ian, about two years ago we stopped giving the quarterly update on year-on-year ASP adjustments, but it's really back to a pretty normal level. 18 or 20 months ago there was a bit of a step change but we are back to a pretty normal level on pricing. Another factor on GM that I didn't talk about was the acquisition of Inova which again a great product portable oxygen concentrators but closer to flow generator profit margin. And so there was two months of the three months of the quarter that we had sold Inova which had an impact on GM as well, but average prices are in a pretty stable environment both in the U.S. and in Europe.
Ian Abbott: Great. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Ian.
Operator: Matt Taylor from Barclays is on the line with a question.
Matt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand the total impact of the various acquisitions in the quarter and any help with which pieces are going where; I’m trying to determine what they contributed versus what you are doing with the AirSense platform.
Mick Farrell: Yes, that is a good question, Matt. Thanks. That will allow us to talk to organic growth and some of the acquisition growth. So as I mentioned just earlier, we had two months of Inova included in the quarter. We also had a full quarter of Curative, our acquisition in China. So when you combine the two months of Inova and the three months of Curative, it probably together contributed around 2% to global growth, so our 9% constant currency global growth was 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven. Those are broad estimates. Brett, do you want to provide any further color on that? Is that approximately right?
Brett Sandercock: That’s spot on, Mick. It contributed around 2% to revenue growth this quarter.
Matt Taylor: How intuitive is in both categories outside the U.S. and Inova is just [indiscernible]?
Mick Farrell: Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, yes. Okay, thanks a lot, very helpful.
Mick Farrell: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on the line with a question.
Andrew Goodsall: Sure, thanks very much. Could I just borrow down a little bit more there and sort of understand if we look at the U.S. flow generator growth with device growth 15%, just within that number what was organically acquired with the Inova?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks for the question Andrew. We really don’t want to sort of because we do give that sort of matrix of detail now within Americas and EMEA and APAC within flow gens and masks. We don’t want to break out the organic versus acquisition debt all the way down the matrix. I can tell you at a high level that the core growth, if we say the market is growing at mid-to high single digits in the sleep apnea markets if you like, we well outperformed that but I don't want to break the 15 out down by basis points because I think that starts to get us into a level of granularity that we just do not get from our competitors on public conference calls and it doesn’t really help our shareholders and driving long-term value but I appreciate the question.
Andrew Goodsall: Okay. So if market is 6% to 8%, you are tracking above that level on your flow gens?
Mick Farrell: Yes, we are significantly above that.
Andrew Goodsall: Great, that's perfect. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with a question.
Margaret Kaczor: Good afternoon, everyone. Good morning, Brett. The first question maybe is on the U. S. side, obviously, we've seen some good durables strength you just talked about it, but you guys are facing a tougher comp as we go into the next few quarters. So, do you envision being able to keep up that double-digit range and just talk about the overall durability of the business. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, good question Margaret. Look, we do want to go into too much. We don’t give guidance. We don't want to go into too much detail. But look at a very high level, we think the Air Solutions Platform and what it has created – the ecosystem it has created is provided such value for our customers and not just the HME customers, but also for patients. We have 900 patients every day signing up to a patient application called myAir. So the value for the ecosystem is just so strong that we see that demand continuing. But we are realistic; we know that there are some big comps particularly on flow generators and particularly in the Americas for Q4 and Q1, but we have a very strong value proposition on that. Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, do want to give any further color on that?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure. Thanks for the question, Margaret. We are seeing very robust growth in the flow gen platforms because of the solutions adoption. The AirSense and AirCurve 10 platforms are both superior products to anything on the market just as a flow generator to begin with, but we are seeing a lot of uptake of our solutions across many, many of our customers and we think that’s driving the persistent growth. We feel very confident in that.
Margaret Kaczor: Okay, great. And then just to keep pushing on that a little bit, how is the sales process may be changed with your acquisition of Brightree, I know it’s kind of early days, but are you seeing your sales guys go into these accounts and sell Brightree, Inova and sleep apnea [ph] in one transaction and how should we expect that go-to-market strategy to change in year one, two and so on? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yeah, thanks, Margaret. Well, there is a lot of aspects to that question. I will let Jim provide a little more color if it makes sense on the go-to-market, but at a high level what we are doing with the Inova acquisition, which we had two months as said of close of that in the quarter is we are working very carefully with our territory managers and our region managers and some specialists from the Inova team on portable oxygen concentrators. In a similar way that we have specialist on ventilation and other respiratory care products, we will have specialist sales force on portable oxygen concentrators. But the full portfolio is available to our whole sales team. And so what we really like to provide is a portfolio of solutions to our customers. There are different selling methodologies and selling cloud-based software that requires an infrastructure investment upfront and signing long-term contract such as Brightree interaction versus providing, say, faster turnaround items such as patient interface systems and masks. However, we have a good portfolio of people in our sales force that can do both the transactional and the long-term strategic sales as part of that. Jim, do you want to provide any further color on the go-to-market for the Brightree and Inova?
Jim Hollingshead: I will comment, may not be further color, I will just say it’s work in progress. We’re a little bit further along with the planning for Inova Labs and how we integrate that. Brightree will continue to be a separate subsidiary, but you can imagine we really just closed both of those acquisitions, so we are working on that plan right now, Margaret.
Margaret Kaczor: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.
Will Dunlop: Thanks. Good morning. You’ve given the contribution of acquisition to sales; are you able to give the contribution to profits or EBIT?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks for the question. We really don’t want to drill down through the whole P&L. With regard to that, we will have an SEC document that we will provide before the end of the fiscal year. So this quarter that will outline the Brightree business in quite some detail, so you will see that in the coming months. But we really don’t want to sort of get into a quarterly reporting where we break down all the way through the P&L for these three acquisitions, but we are happy to provide that color at the top line that it is around 2% of global growth, so 9% total growth, 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven.
Will Dunlop: Okay, thank you. And are you just able to give some color around what your U. S. customers are asking for in terms of price given that we are heading into the implementation of round two [indiscernible] and full round three price reduction as of July 1?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, I will hand to Jim Hollingshead; he is closest to the U. S. business line.
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, we’ve been having those conversations for months with customers. I think that this year is a little bit different from FY2014 when CB2 hit for the first time. So the vast majority of our customers have anticipated what’s coming and we’ve been having pricing conversations with them for months. And so, this does hit their business and we are continuing to have the normal pricing conversations in that context.
Will Dunlop: Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Will.
Operator: Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question.
Mike Matson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to ask about Brightree. I know there has been concern amongst the HME customer base around the data that you guys have access to through their cloud-based system, so I was just wondering, one, do you think that’s a risk, that they only need some of those customers and then they might choose to move to a different software provider? And two, is there a way that you can try to wall off that data and convince them that you are not going to use that to try to help your flow generator and masks sales?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Mike. The Brightree acquisition is really – when you think about it, it’s a huge investment that ResMed made, around 10% of our market cap we invested, $800 million in our HME customers in software that is purely focused on having cloud-based software applications that take laborious tasks like revenue cycle management, like inventory management, like clinical protocol management and physician signature management and automate those. And so, we think that instead of being owned by a venture capital firm being owned by a player who has a long-term 27-year history in its industry and plan to invest for the next 27 years in providing home medical equipment, but it's a really positive sign for our customers that it’s got strong financial backing and someone who really cares about it. We are excited about the hospice and we're excited about home health because those are the new channels that the Brightree acquisition brings. Have a lot of sleep disorder breathing and a lot of COPD and neuromuscular disease patients, so that we can roll back in to our HME customers. But look I got to tell you, I haven’t had as many conversations with Jim, but I have out of these last 2.5 plus months since we announced this acquisition been in a number of dinners and conversations with customers where I express what our goals are and what our plans are with Brightree and how we are going to invest to not only improve good quality to great quality, but ensure that we have even more efficiencies for them as a whole channel and our investment is to make sure more and more sleep apnea patients are able to be served by them has been received very positively. But, Jim, do want to talk a little bit more to the specifics of Mike’s question?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, sure, it's a great question and we have had that question from customers, right. And I will say as a blanket statement to start, we are absolutely committed to putting in place appropriate protection for our customers’ business sensitive information. It’s very important to us that we do that, that’s how we work with our customers in general and that’s how we are as a company and so we are completely committed to that. But if I go broader and just say about the reaction of customers in the market, it has been more than two months since we announced that acquisition. And generally speaking, I think that the response from our customers has been very positive. And I think you can see in the Q3 results that if anything it’s impacted the business positively.
Mike Matson: All right. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the international business, at 3% growth, I mean what do you think those markets are growing at, do you think you are gaining or losing share in those markets? And just comment on the air solutions, it’s doing really well in the U.S., but do you think it is as appealing to those international customers?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, good question, Mark. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Rob Douglas: Yeah, thanks, Mike. In all of our other countries around the world, we view them as a portfolio; they are all running on different dynamics. And some are growing strongly at various times and other ones have challenging periods. Across the board, we are seeing – we talk about the mid-single market growth, mid-single digits market growth, and we believe that we are very much holding our own in that market growth and going well. The air solutions dynamic is quite different in different countries and every country has own major drivers. Some things are always the same, patients are always interested in their information and anything we can provide to them that helps them use the equipment and stay on using equipment that improves their outcome is useful. And we are seeing that in all of those markets. In other markets, we have to deal with specific issues, specific privacy concerns in Europe, language concerns in Japan, for example, and all of those things we’ve got going well and we are on, I guess, it’s slower than the U.S. but a very solid implementation plan through all of those countries to roll air solutions out. It’s an ongoing program for us.
Mike Matson: All right, thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Mick.
Operator: Matth O’Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with question.
J.P. Peltier: This is actually J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess in terms of going back to the revenue break down between flow generator and masks, I mean you’ve been able to grow flow generators faster than masks for the past few quarters and arguably tougher comps, so I’m just trying to drill in on the mask side of the business, is there anything going on from a competitive dynamic or from a pricing headwind perspective that is making performance there challenging?
Mick Farrell: Look, don't judge the outperformance of our flow generators to make our masks look bad. I mean the Americas flow generator performance at 16% year-on-year provided on a constant currency basis was just incredible and driven by, as Rob said, a very fast take up a air solutions in these last 18 months, it’s a longer haul for some of those other 99 countries we do business in. The 10% year-on-year constant currency growth in masks and accessories I think is exceptional. And certainly keeping share and probably taking share in some categories. Look, having said that, we are in a competitive game and the competitive game is across the board. We changed the basis of competition in flow generators, which has allowed us to outperform in that category. Will we and can we continue to change the game and bring increasing and great innovation to our mask platform? Well, we’ve been doing it for 27 years and we plan to do it for the next 27 years. So the answer to that is yes. We put 7% of our revenues approximately into research and development, a very good chunk of that goes into mask innovation, plastic science, anthropometric, understanding what patients need now and in the future. And I got to tell you I am really excited about the pipeline of masks and I think that the team did well in that in Q3, but we can always do better. Sure just a follow-up, on the competitive that you alluded to what is in the feedback the year-over-year sales reps effort on this treat from the Phillips launch?
J.P. Peltier: Sure. And just a follow-up on the competitive dynamics you alluded to. What is in the feedback that you’ve heard or your sales have heard on the street from Philips-Medtronic generator launch?
Mick Farrell: You know, look, I really don't like to sort of throw a model, get involved in sort of a competitor back and forth on these conference call J.P. All I will say is that look our device, and it’s really our solution, the air solutions platform has incredible advantages. We take great cost out of the system, we provide such value for our customers and customers are using a broad sense. The customer is the patient obviously but it’s also the provider, the DME, it is also payers and other folks beyond. And the value we are able to do by linking up with EMR and EHR systems in a closed payer-provider network or a government run insurance in Western Europe network or – and the data we’re able to provide, patients means the strong demand for our product. And so I do think we’ve got a winning value proposition. I think it’s a very sustainable competitive advantage. But having said that, we believe in productive paranoia. And as I was saying earlier, we innovate our cloud-based systems on a regular basis. Weekly and monthly upgraded to these to make sure we keep those is a finely oiled machine here and that’s our goal in this space. But look there is always competition. We love competition. What we love doing is really providing value to customers and customers choosing our products and solutions because of that.
J.P. Peltier: Great, thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, J.P.
Operator: Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mick, maybe a question for you. I think in the past you’ve talked to a mask lifecycle of around 1.5, maybe 2 years, I just want to check if that’s still correct, because you are up the T’s I think since the range of the masks were launched. And I'm just wondering where we are in terms of that launch cycle, how should we be expecting some new masks anytime soon?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Saul. Yeah, well, I mean, I was talking about the healthcare informatics lifecycle of being every couple of months with an upgrade. Mask systems – it depends on the full face, the nasal, the pillows and the technologies you are using. The AirFit range has been incredibly successful. The P10 mask, which is a nasal pillows mask, which I personally use, is the best mask on the planet for nasal pillows and our F10 remains clearly a world leading mask. And the N10, I think it's a very good mask, I think look we can always do better. And every time we release a product we are looking to do better. You know, Saul, that we don’t go into the specifics of our roadmap, but if you are asking me are there are exciting masks in the horizon? Of course, there are. How far is that horizon now? Well, I can’t go into details on that. It just doesn’t make sense to from a competitive dynamic front given the public nature of this call.
Saul Hadassin: Fair enough. And just to sneak one more in for Brett, just regarding operating cash flow, another quarter of very strong right there, I think, for the nine months it’s up almost 40% with essentially flat non-GAAP earnings, just wondering what you’ve changed there in terms of that working capital management that has benefited that line?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The cash flow has been very strong for the business and has been quite sustained over the three quarters as you noted. So we're really pleased with that. If you look at the big one there is probably around inventory where we’ve managed to reduce that over time. There's a lot with the essence growth thing, so strong over the period. I think now we’ve had time to stabilize that and adjust somewhat. So we really started tune inventory levels and I think that sort of – its underlying – the strong underlying earnings has played a part for sure and then really turning that inventory, I think, it’s just sort of underpin and deliver some stronger cash flow through those quarters. That's probably bring the biggest impact.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks guys.
Operator: Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question.
Anthony Petrone: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on Brightree and I think you touched on it earlier. So forgive me if I'm overlapping me here a bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on the strategy there, how long do you think it will take to fully integrate Brightree and sort of what synergies do you expect particularly in the HME, DME channel in the U. S. in terms of just install base on the Brightree side? Is there an opportunity to sort of up sell Brightree solutions into the existing ResMed install base?
Mick Farrell: Well, thanks for the question, Anthony. Clearly the revenue and EBITDA is an immediate integration right. So, we get a nice addition of $113 million growing at strong levels on the top line and north of $43 million of EBITDA growing strong double-digits as well, so that was integrated immediately. In terms of the operating integration, as Jim said earlier, we will run Brightree as a subsidiary that has clearly separation of some data to make sure that our teams perform everything appropriately. The synergies with customers are that clearly we have customers who purchase our products and will also purchase Brightree solutions. So there will be a clear coordination between our sales force, but as Jim said, we closed the acquisition on April 4, and it is now April 26, we haven’t fully integrated our go-to-market in the first 22 days, but we do have a 91-83-60 [ph] plan here and will be able to provide, probably on this call over the coming fourth quarters, further and further integrations including obviously financial integration starting Q4 those numbers rolling in, but then the go-to-market integration over the coming four quarters.
Anthony Petrone: And then, just one follow-up there and hop back in, but just – again should we assume that this is traditional software margin structure, where it should be margin accretive overall to the business or will that take some time to sort of play out?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Anthony. It will be immediately gross margin accretive and I think Brett in his prepared remarks talked about 70 to 100 basis points of positive contribution is likely in Q4 from including of the Brightree – the Brightree financials. So, it is a really good immediately accretive on top line and on GM.
Anthony Petrone: Got it. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Anthony. 
Operator: Victor Windeyer from Citi is on the line with a question.
Victor Windeyer: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to try it out a bit, trying to get the underlying plain growth. So you mentioned [indiscernible] I think back in the day when the trial [indiscernible] result came out, you’ve had $150 million of [indiscernible] and I just want to know if you could give us any clarity on what the quarter will be year-on-year? [Indiscernible] whether it’s flat sequentially now?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Victor. I’ll hand it to Rob to address the European and ASV question.
Rob Douglas: Yeah, thanks, Victor. When we made the announcement last year, we sort of gave some indications of what we felt the impact would be. We are pretty accurate in those predictions and so we roughly standby those predictions. The impact has been more significant in Europe where we had an indication for cardiology patients versus in the U.S. where we didn’t. Our team working hard on some of the other applications for ASV and Mick mentioned them earlier on. Particularly talking about on complex sleep apnea as well as on patients who are on pain medication and so we see a lot of opportunities there and those market development opportunities are underway not only emphasize in the U.S., but also in other markets around the world. And we should start to see some benefit from those activities selling through. And as Nick also said earlier, we will anniversary the announcement on May 13 and the impact that we – the short-term impact that we had after that came on fairly quickly. So we should see those activities even up from there on in.
Victor Windeyer: Okay. So, after you give the timing, you said 25% [indiscernible] maybe that’s clearly the $40 million or something, $10 million a quarter, I mean is that roughly where it comes in, is that what you --?
Mick Farrell: Victor, we’re not going to go into the details. You’re right. That’s what we side. At that time, we said it’s – ASV is roughly 7% of the revenues and we thought a quarter of that might be at risk and roughly on the global numbers that’s roughly in line. As Rob said, it was a bit ahead of that in Europe and Americas was not as badly affected as Europe.
Rob Douglas : Thanks for your question, Victor.
Victor Windeyer: [Indiscernible] level we expected to grow with the applications, we are going expect that one to grow in the underlying business to come forward [indiscernible].
Mick Farrell: Yeah, yeah, Victor, as I said earlier and Rob just said now, from May 13, we will hit the anniversary of the date of the announcement and from then the activity went pretty quickly as Rob said. So we should expect to ramp to strong positive ASV growth from that date. But really as I said in my prepared remarks, fiscal 2017 is where we are going to see the benefits of complex sleep apnea, payments medication, post traumatic stress disorder and also some other applications on CSA that are interesting in the sort of stroke patients and others. So, we’ll see those going forward.
Victor Windeyer: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Victor.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos from Morningstar is on the line with the question.
Chris Kallos: Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on the gross margin side, the guidance of 57%, 60% does that include the margin equation from Brightree?
Mick Farrell: Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, Chris. Hi, it’s Brett. Yes, it does.
Chris Kallos: Okay. So does that suggest that without Brightree the gross margin would be sort of on the low side? So the guidance would actually be lower?
Brett Sandercock: I am not sure you can conclude that Chris. At the end of the day, we sort of 57% to 60% obviously Brightree will have a quite significant positive impact for us going into Q4 and then all the other factors play out as well that’s come up with that guidance range. I don't think you can form a conclusion either way on what the guidance would have been in, but certainly Brightree will have a positive impact on that.
Chris Kallos: Great. And just a quick follow-up, on the reimbursements, you mentioned on the rebid, are there any other comments you could add to that on just reimbursement right now?
Brett Sandercock: No. there is nothing new in the reimbursement environment globally. So, I mean frankly everything that’s been talked about in the U. S. has been projected, the government run process, so it is usually projected 12, 24, even 36 months in advance. So, there is really now news on the reimbursement plan.
Chris Kallos: Great. Thank you. 
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. 
Margaret Kaczor: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking a follow-up. Maybe the first question, just a follow-up on, we know that the ASV is obviously had an impact on the international dynamics, but do you guys have a same store growth number if you do take ASVs out of international? 
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Margaret. Good follow-up, but we do not want to provide that level of detail. Rob if you can provide any color to help address Margaret's question that we want to share. 
Rob Douglas: No, we really do not want to break that out Margaret, but obviously with the ASV not helping some of the other underlying parts of the business, it would look better, if the ISC wasn’t included in it, but it’s just too commercially sensitive to break all that out.
Brett Sandercock: I mean the one bit of color we can provide is that ASV, and this is important as it starts to come back in 2017. It’s a very margin accretive product. It's a very margin accretive product. So, as it starts to come back it will really benefit us and clearly, just hitting the 12 month mark of a headwind that’s been a tough 11 months on the GM front as you guys have seen in the numbers with that as a headwind as it starts to turn mutual and become a tailwind in 2017. It can really help us, but clearly we are executing on ASV we got some really exciting applications for it, you will hear more from us on this front in the future.
Margaret Kaczor: Great. And then, just in terms of gross margin again, Brett maybe you can give us a little bit more perspective, you mentioned mix ASP and geographic mix, should we think of that about that third or third or third or overweight one of those categories and as ASV comes back, is that the primary driver to maybe reverse that trend on gross margins for the course sleep apnea business and over what timeframe should we expect that? Thank you. 
Rob Douglas: So that seven part multi-question, it’s a perfect one for Brett.
Brett Sandercock: I’ll have a crack of that one. Thanks, Margaret. Look, the most significant one has definitely been product mix and that’s been the biggest one and that’s multiple really, obviously ASV is playing out there a little bit and playing out there as well and just a really strong outperformance in flow generators. So, it’s a big thing of those - with ASV that sort of stuff dissipates certainly through Q4 and then into Q1. So that will certainly help. And then, obviously Brightree comes on boarding in Q4 as well. And then just as I mentioned earlier just depends on the trends for products mix and also geographic mix. So, even really strong outperformance in the Americas, which is positive, does have an impact on the growth margin. So, a number of factors playing out, but some of those moderate and some of kind of disappeared into FY17. So, I think that’s good. I mean the important thing on that European and ASV headwind, is that that’s go away and that’s if you strip that out, the device number internationally would be better. So, I think that’s something to look at that, I think that obviously headwind is really detracting from international and that is definitely something it’s going to go away into FY17.
Margaret Kaczor: Thank you, guys very helpful. 
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on the line with a question.
Suraj Kalia: Good afternoon everyone, Mick one question for you and one for Brett. Mick you give a pretty good insight into how you are going to be integrating Brightree and you're going to be helping your customers, I guess let me just belabor that point, specifically Phillips and the [well-wisher] customers. So what is the stickiness if I can use that word, for Phillips and developers staying with Brightree? In other words, do you all risk losing Phillips and Devilbiss some point in the future, how do all prevent that because that would be some portion of Brightree's revenues?
Mick Farrell: The revenues for Brightree come from the customers who are the HME providers and HME providers have a portfolio of products that they use. So they - our customers or the HME providers are buying from ResMed and some of the competitors that you named. So my presumption is our customers will continue to want to buy from them and would want them to use the software program that our customers are using. It is as simple as that. It is not our decision or our competitors decision it’s the customers decision and the customer has to make a right decision and about the economic interests, the longer-term interest primarily with their patients and for growing business efficiently. So, we think that will play out, really we've had two or three months of this out there and playing out just fine as far as we see it. So, we're pretty excited frankly two months after the announcement and really only 22 days after the close and we're revving up to move forward.
Suraj Kalia: Fair enough. And Brett I know you mentioned 7% organic growth and 2% acquired on a constant currency basis and maybe I missed this, Brett since curative is primarily [U. S.] , Inova is primarily U. S. can you give us the as reported numbers for the quarter? Thank you for taking my questions. 
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. I think Mick talked about it earlier in terms of getting going too much into the detail on that. I think you guys - the overall number was 2% and either would be squid to devices obviously and then more spread. So, I think probably did not have some fair estimates on what kind of the impacts would be through the categories without going into too much detail on it.
Operator: We are now at the one hour Mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. 
Mick Farrell: Thank you, Andrew. And in closing, I want to welcome the Inova and Brightree teams to our global ResMed team and to thank the now almost 5000 strong team here at ResMed from around the world for their commitment to changing lives, of millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished not just here in Q3, but beyond in creating the world’s leading tech driven medical device company. We remain laser focused our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 by literally giving products and the gift of breath to those folks. Thanks for your time and we will talk to again in 90 days.
Agnes Lee: Thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website in about two hours at investors.resmed.com. Andrew you may now close the call.
Operator: This concludes ResMed’s third quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may disconnect.

Mick Farrell: Thanks Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us on today, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We have made great progress towards our long-term ResMed 2020 goals this quarter. We achieved solid double-digit constant currency revenue growth led by strong regional results in the Americas. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Inova Labs based in Austin, Texas. This acquisition expands our respiratory care therapeutics portfolio for COPD each now include portable oxygen concentrators. First, I’ll discuss our top and bottom-line results, I’ll then review some regional highlights from our business and progress on our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that I’ll hand the call over to Brett our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. For the fifth quarter in a row, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 17%. We achieved solid steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regional groups. These global results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud-based connected care software platform, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.69 on a non-GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investments and growth opportunities, and significantly expanding our install base of cloud connected medical devices. At the same time, we have been efficiently managing our OpEx growth in both R&D as well as SG&A. This quarter, we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our top line growth. We continue to invest for the future in research and development, maintaining our R&D investment level at around 6% to 7% of top line revenue. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had very strong sales performance in Q2, with our commercial team driving to 17% growth in a competitive market. Flow generator growth in the region was 23%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms powered and catalyzed by Air Solutions software. The mask and accessories categories grew at a solid 11% in the Americas for Q2. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016 and beyond. We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 7% on a constant currency basis in Q2. We continue to see good growth in our sleep disorder breathing business and our respiratory care businesses in these regions. The headwinds that we have faced from the SERVE-HF trial results of May 2015m continued to be annualized through the P&L and this will continue until May 2016. The ASV sales impact for Q2 in Europe was broadly consistent with last quarter. As we noted during our last quarter investor call, the ASV sales impact in the U.S. continues to be less than that in Europe. The ASV platform remains an excellent therapeutic solution for a number of important clinical applications including one, treatment emergent central sleep apnea; two, opiod or pain management induced central sleep apnea; three, post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. This quarter, we acquired Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark. These forward vertical integration acquisitions have proved very valuable to us in the past, we expect this to be the same. We also expect that our partnership with the great team at Maribo which is now part of ResMed Denmark will allow us to continue to lead in market development in the country and to build connected care and digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond. Now, I’d like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Before going to the three horizons, I’d like to talk about three key underlying enablers of our strategy. The first of these is our global leadership in healthcare informatics, the second is our expansion in high growth geographic markets, and the third is a focus on our best in class operational excellence. So, the first enabler on our list is our global leadership in healthcare informatics. Connected care and digital health are almost now industry buzzwords that are referred to by many companies in the space. We’re not just talking about it, we’re executing on this front with over 1 million cloud connected medical devices, sending data every morning to the cloud, and more than 750 patients signing up every day for our patient application called myAir. We are transforming ResMed into a tech-driven medical device leader. Our first step on this journey has been changing the basis of competition in our core sleep apnea business. We led the industry 15 months ago with 100% cloud connected medical devices and now our competition has had to follow. We are improving the efficiency of our customers by embedding our software solutions in their work flow and providing value to providers, physicians and patients by improving patient device adherence and therefore patient outcomes. We can leverage this core competency from sleep apnea into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD into neuromuscular disease and other chronic disease spaces. Our second enabler is our investment and expansion in high growth geographies. Our investment in Curative last quarter is an example of this strategy in action. Curative allows us to have products developed in China, made in China for sale in China. It opens up channels that just weren’t available for imported products. We’ll continue to invest and expand our presence in China, South Korea, India, Brazil and many countries in Eastern Europe. In each country, the value we deliver is to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for the country in key chronic diseases. Our third enabler is operational excellence. It is an important and fundamental foundation to our growth strategy. It’s just part of our DNA. We continue to create efficiencies to allow us to free up cash, to invest back into innovative organic R&D programs and also allow us to better unlock value from our tuck-in acquisitions. We take a continuous improvement approach across our entire global business including component supply management, manufacturing excellence, supply chain and logistics optimization, and OpEx management. We are committed to grow our operating profit and to ensure that we have headroom to free up cash to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes updating you on progress against our long-term ResMed 2020 growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea franchise, our leadership in healthcare informatics remains a critical growth driver. Last month a market research firm, Berg Insight published a report on mobile health and home monitoring. The report ranked ResMed as the number one global leader in connected care for all medical devices. This was not just in respiratory medicine but in all device categories including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and beyond. So 15 months after the launch of AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and Air Solutions the cloud based softer platform, we have achieved this market leadership position. I want to tell you that we are not done. We intend to continue our leadership in connected care and digital health as we add features and enhancements to our solution to bring even more value for providers and physicians, and even better applications for patients to see their own data, to participate more in their own health and wellness. With well over 1 million patients, cloud connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables providing daily updates to the cloud, we are liberating data, providing actionable information, unlocking value, and improving outcomes for patients, physicians, providers and for payors. Our customers are clearly experiencing the value proposition of the AirSense and Air Solutions platform and incorporating this into their workflows, and reaping cost savings in their own P&L. On an investor call last year, I referenced a clinical care study that was presented at the American Thoracic Society in which an Air Solutions customers saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83%, along with the 59% decrease in their own labor costs. Earlier this month, this clinical care study was published in the peer reviewed journal called Sleep and Breathing. We continue to deliver results like this for many of our customers. And many of these are proprietary results that we just cannot share. One study that I was committed to share at the JP Morgan health care conference in San Francisco earlier this month, showed an increase from a very solid baseline of 60% adherence for our customer, the standard care up to top tier patient adherence of 87% when using our cloud-based Air Solutions platform. You will see further publications and evidence from us showing increased operating efficiencies for our customers and increased patient adherence like this, all enabled Air Solutions. Connected care is here to stay. Our acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added both ResMed branded resupply solutions combined with an end to end referral and document management system for our customers. Our system provides automated resupply solutions to customers, so that they can effectively manage ongoing supplies of masks and accessories to patients via automated text, via e-mail, and even via interactive voice response. We also have a multilingual call center backing up the solution. The referral and document management capability reduces days patient and position sign off, reduces the number of errors and incomplete documents, and eliminates a large number of follow-up phone calls. These systems improve both our homecare customers efficiencies and just as importantly, their cash flow. In terms of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we announced the acquisition of Austin, Taxes based Inova Labs which we plan to complete this quarter. With this acquisition, we have expanded our therapeutic portfolio to COPD, to include portable oxygen concentrators or POCs. POCs enable patient mobility and fit well with our life support ventilator platform called Astral. Both of these give increased mobility and increased freedom back to COPD patients. Inova Labs fits well with our respiratory care strategy and our innovative company culture here at ResMed. We know that we can manage the business to add to ResMed shareholder value. We even know that we will have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels. We will work to prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into maximize physician, provider, and patient value. We will also be able to bring global operational and technological capability to create economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing and logistics at Inova Labs. Finally, together with the team in research and development in Austin and Sydney and beyond, we can create next generation products that leverage our healthcare informatics leadership to create solutions for connected care for COPD. Finally, I would like to review our third horizon of growth. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities in new markets including atrial fibrillation, nocturnal asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. Rob and I and others from our team attended the Consumer Electronics Show or CES earlier this month in Las Vegas. Almost every variable and non-variable health and wellness technology at CES included sleep as part of their offering. This clearly shows that there is a demand from consumers to measure, monitor and improve their sleep. Our S+ by ResMed sleep wellness tool is just our first foray into this space. Consumers realize that sleep health is as important as cardiovascular exercise and good nutrition for overall health, and we agree. We also continue to explore clinical areas of interest in adjacent market. For our more than 26-year history, our team at ResMed has emphasized relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and related clinical areas. Through our recent $5 million gift to the University of California at San Diego, we have helped to establish a world leading center for clinical care and medical research in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD, the two most costly and most important clinic diseases in the field of respiratory medicine. You will see plenty of exciting developments in the field from this team. One recent example was a sleep apnea and cancer symposium at UCSD that worked together key opinion leaders in pulmonology with KOLs from oncology to discuss the impacts of sleep disorder breathing and specifically repetitive hypoxia on cancer cell development. Although these discussions are still in their early days, literally at the molecular level, this is just one of many new clinical areas that could lead to new therapeutics and solutions for patients that ResMed could provide in the future. So returning back to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. And this quarter in Q2, we bought back 700,000 shares. In addition to funding our dividend and completing the acquisitions of Curative Medical and Maribo Medico. We continue to look for potential acquisitions where these three criteria are met: One, the business is aligned with our long-term ResMed 2020 drug strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and three, really importantly, that there is a cultural fit between the business team and ResMed. We clearly hit and nailed all of these three criteria with our acquisition of Inova and our acquisition of Maribo. And we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we move forward. We are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly in products and solutions innovation in connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly for patients all around the world. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Mick. Revenue for December quarter was $454.5 million, an increase of 7% over prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21.7 million in the second quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $269.5 million, an increase of 17% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC totaled $185 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. However in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. Breaking our revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $136.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $133 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and APAC, flow generator sales were $123.5 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $61.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred restructure expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our European R&D and manufacturing facility. These operations have been integrated in their existing largest care locations. Restructure charge consists primarily of severance payments and an asset write down of a legacy manufacturing facility. Additionally, during the quarter, we released $2.4 million of an accrual associated with our SERVE-HF field safety notice activity, as we substantially conclude the obligation arising from the field safety notification. During the rest of my commentary today, I’ll refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of restructure expenses and the SERVE-HF accrual released in the current quarter, as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles, both in the current year and last year. We’ve reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Non-GAAP gross margin for the December quarter was 58.1%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 410 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, and an unfavorable geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. However, on a sequential basis, non-GAAP gross margin improved slightly increasing from 58% in the September quarter. Given current exchange rates and taking into account the current trending products and geographic mix combined with the impact from our cost out programs and our recent acquisitions, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. Moving onto operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $118.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26% compared to the year ago figure of 29%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29 million a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year ago figure of 6.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitments to investing in our diverse product pipeline including informatics solutions, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.4 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $116.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $97.5 million, also an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $9.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted second earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar, partially offset by the weaker euro. Cash flow from operations was a record $147.4 million for the quarter, this reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in the net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $21.5 million. We continue to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, additionally during the quarter we repurchased 700,000 shares for consideration of $40.1 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. During the quarter we completed three international acquisitions, Curative Medical based in China; Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark; and then a precision tooling company located in Sydney. These acquisitions were funded by utilizing our existing cash balances. Additionally, this month, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Inova Labs. Inova Labs is a U.S. domiciled entity and this acquisition will be funded by utilizing our existing credit facility. We expect to include Inova Labs in our consolidated results in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the rolling 12 months ended December 31, we returned 84% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Over the last five years, we’ve returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balance at the end of the quarter was $257 million while December 31 total assets stood at $2.2 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that I’ll hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Susan, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O’Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Matthew O’Brien: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start off on the generator side and the performance in this quarter again very, very strong. Just curious as far as what you’re seeing in the marketplace with this product now out there today, are you guys competing head to head? And if so, it seems like you’re continuing to be very successful. Is that a trend that we should expect going forward.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, that allows us to talk about our Air Solutions portfolio and AirSense 10 and how it fits in the market. I’ll have a first go and then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to talk a little bit about Americas business and what’s happening there with the AirSense 10 launch. So, as I said in the remarks earlier, we have had competitors follow us into the space with the cloud-connected devices. We think our offering is superior because it’s 100% cloud-connected and requires a channel to do nothing other than plug it in and breath, and in the morning the data go to the cloud, and then can be accessed by the patient on myAir or the physician on AirView or the payor provider through an API from Air Solutions. And we think it’s a really strong value proposition taking up to 60% of the labor costs out of the channel for them. And it’s just a really important improvement to their P&L. And it’s really embedded in their workflow and becomes something that they are doing well. We believe in competition; we like healthy competition; and we like the fact that our competitors are looking to compete on value offerings, not just in the flow generators segment but in the masks segment and looking to compete with technology. And so, as we look forward, the market growth rate is in the mid to high single digit numbers. We like to meet or beat market growth rate; we don’t except it, we drive beyond that. That’s sort of where we are at. But Jim, anymore color on the Americas?
Jim Hollingshead: Thanks Mick. We are very confident in our offering. I mean the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms have been very, very well-received. We have taken lot of -- we’ve taken a significant market share and the Air Solutions inclusion in that. So, as Mick is saying, I think we’ve now clearly proven to our customers that we can drive efficiencies in their business with the platform. So that’s a very compelling offer, remains a very compelling offer, even in right of competitor launches. We obviously have big comps that we are going to work through. And so your question was about sustainability, we intend to continue to grow our program, position above market growth rate. But given the share we’ve taken, I don’t think that’s sustainable indefinitely, [ph] the growth rate you’ve seen this quarter.
Matthew O’Brien: Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, talking about the Inova acquisition, just curious as far as where they were selling historically and where you can take that device fairly quickly? And then the investments that you’re going to need to make in support of it, is activity pretty sizable and then how does that business affect the financial make up of ResMed? I think that the gross margin profile and operating margin profile likely be somewhat of a headwind going forward.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Matt. The Inova acquisition is a great opportunity for us; it’s our first foray after 26 years of positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation, and dental treatment, so our first foray into portable oxygen concentrators. And it’s a great technology, has great mobility and gives great freedom back in terms of the battery life and the weight of these portable oxygen concentrators. Yes, when you look at our scale and selling into 100 countries, Inova currently sales into five to maybe 10 countries. So, you’ve got a 10 to 20x multiple, just on the number of geographic countries that we can move into. And so, we are really excited about it. I might ask Rob -- Rob Douglas, our COO, President and Chief Operating Officer and I were touring the plant in Austin last week just before JP Morgan and it was great to walk around and see all the team and to get a feel for the innovation. Rob, any further comments as to the investments and what we need to do going forward?
Rob Douglas: Yes. I mean obviously Inova is at a scale not where ResMed is at but they are at a scale that ResMed use to be at. And so, walking around the factory, there’s lot of a very similar approaches to what ResMed have taken in the early days. And we know that we can actually share a lot of experiences and working and integrating those teams, we can really accelerate the development of way that -- way those products go and how we take them into the market. Huge amount of opportunity there, really good cultural fit; it’s going to be very exciting for us all to work in that area.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.
David Low: First, I just had a question around pricing, I mean really there has been the experience of competitive bidding round two and what that led to and how the manufacturer process, just wondering what your experience has been as we head into international roll out of competitive bidding?
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Dave. Competitive bidding has been in play for almost seven years now, CB1, CB2 and then the national expansion that is going on, as we speak from January 1 through July 1. So, these obviously have had an impact. We have talked about that over the last number of quarters on our customers, and we have worked with our customers to make sure that we can help them approve the efficiencies of their P&L and drive to a profitable growth through all of this in the value chain so that we can continue to serve patients and invest in infrastructure. A lot of our investments around Air Solutions are about taking 50%, 60% of the cost -- the labor cost out of the channel and so therefore improving the P&L. Obviously acquisition price hold [indiscernible] are in their P&L as well but when you’re able to take 60% of the labor cost that frees up a lot of cash for reinvestment in their business. And it’s really bringing a technology solution into apply. I would characterize the pricing environment as historic normal and what it has been over the last number of many years. We don’t go to quantitative detail of that for competitive purposes, but I’d say it’s at historic normal levels.
David Low: I think to follow up on the same topic, I guess what I’m looking for is a little bit of comfort that what we saw with right round two where I think your commentary was quite similar at this after just announced that we’re not -- or that you’re comfortable that we’re not going to see [ph] the dynamic with the competitors I think in -- the competitors push pricing down and raise ResMed in due course followed. Are you concerned that there is a risk of that playing out gain or...
Mick Farrell: Yes Dave, I can’t predict the psychology of other players in the market. I can tell you what we’ve done and what we continue to do, which is we bring technology into play that improves the P&L for our value chain. And we really understand how that value chain operates. And we’ve got embedded into the workflows and really helped partner with industry to take those costs out. And we will continue to do that in the future. Other players in the marketplace have followed and produced similar technologies. We don’t think they are quite as good but they’re doing similar things which is looking to take labor costs and inefficiencies out of a system. And frankly, together we aimed our competitors in the space, are fighting the real competitor, which is frequent [ph] in the hospital and getting those patients with sleep apnea and COPD rather than going back to the ER taking care of them by product on bedside table and using data from that to get back to the hospital system, back to the API system, so that they know that they kept out of play.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos of Morningstar is on line with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Chris Kallos: Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in light of the acquisitions and Inova in Denmark, how does that affect your CapEx going forward? Can you provide some you guidance on that?
Mick Farrell: Brett, do you want to take that question?
Brett Sandercock: I mean it’s the CapEx that sort of run at around -- let’s go to sort of run rate 13, 14, 15 in the quarter something like that. In terms of Maribo, it’s very much a distributor, so it’s not a lot of [indiscernible] product that one, so I don’t see too much impact there. To move to things like Inova, probably be a small uptick but pretty negligible, fairly small operation at the moment. I think the big one on that in terms of investment, they’re not big; where we’ll incrementally put some money I think is in R&D, really think we can turbo-charge those products and them very effective. And obviously with our distribution channel capability, what we can bring to the table, we very much think that we can grow that business very nicely. So, pretty -- some small investments but nothing significant.
Chris Kallos: And just a follow-up on the R&D in Inova, are you planning on keeping that domiciled in the U.S. and how does that affect your 6% to 7% forecast on R&D?
Mick Farrell: Rob, do you want to take that question maybe or -- we have Rob, why don’t you go first and then maybe Brett can answer.
Rob Douglas: We’re still working on integration plans and finalizing how that’s going to work. But we don’t see in the short-term major moves. It’s a really good team in Austin, who really know the stuff around that and they have confidence and we’re very keen to maximize the value of that. In terms of ongoing [indiscernible] made a short-term bit of investment in the R&D, but long-term that shouldn’t change how we think about the right level of investment for R&D for our overall business.
Operator: Anthony Petrone with Jefferies is online with the questions. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Great, thanks a lot. One quick for Brett and then I’ll follow-up with the question on just some CMS news that was coming out late last year. Just Brett on the acquisitions in the quarter, they were three that -- one was we were aware of but the other two in terms of distributor work or integration we were not aware of. So what was the collective contribution just from those three acquisitions in the quarter in terms of revenue and EPS? And then one follow-up. Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I mean these are pretty small acquisitions, so not going down to that granularity. I think we did for those ones, not material from our perspective, so we haven’t disclosed too much detail on that.
Anthony Petrone: And then just from a margin perspective, this vertical integration, will that help offset some of the pressures that you’ve been seeing? And maybe just an update on the transition from I guess area of freight charges which was a tailwind that was potentially coming in the second half of this year. Was there any benefit from that this quarter or do you expect that to be more of a second half event?
Brett Sandercock: So, just on the first one, it really -- continuing on the acquisitions, they’re fairly small, so that’s kind of around the ages. But typically with the vertical integration for example in the distribution, that would help, that would sort of be if you like help improve your margins or be accretive to your margin for example. If you look at benefit [ph] example that’s really vertical integration within our supplies and we think we can pick up obviously, it’s for better tooling cost but also improvements in strategically in markets and things like that. So that was what we call it’s not strategic tuck in for us. If you look at acquisitions such as Inova, and I think we highlighted that at the time, there will be a little bit of dilution to gross margin there. So that does present a little bit of a headwind but I think the opportunities are so good for us on that on growing that portable oxygen and concentrator market and our share in the product and so on that I think it was quite compelling for us to do so. We weren’t going to worry about sort of, some sort of myAir margin dilution if you like impact, from not doing the deal, we think it will be pretty compelling in due course. And on the freight side of things, we’re seeing some of that coming through and obviously we will see more of that coming through in the second half as well of the fiscal.
Operator: And Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse is on line. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Saul Hadassin: Thanks very much. Maybe question for Brett as well, on gross margins, jus looking the sequential movement up about 10 basis points. Looking at your mix, product mix, if anything is probably slightly better this quarter than 1Q ‘16. You should had a benefit from a lower Aussie U.S. sort of line, just wondering was there anything holding back that gross margin uplift? For example what was the reference before so that moved to -- is that still to come through? In terms of your underlying gross margin ex the dilution that might come from the Inova just wondering should you -- should we think sequential gross margin uplift over the course of this fiscal year assuming currently holds where it is? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I mean it’s a little sequentially; we still are seeing an impact on -- negative impact from product mix and also geographic mix. And of course I mean the big standouts obviously you know Americas growth and then the flow generator growth as well, that remains really strong. So, there’s still headwinds for us but in the frame there’s a whole bunch of other stuff. We had a small uplift from FX, you’re right, that was probably around 40 basis points or so. There’s a bunch of other -- there’s other stuff that plays out on that that can impact you kind of quarter to quarter. But overall, I guess you’d characterize that as kind of margins pretty much stabilized. And depending on trends, on product mix and geographic mix I suppose the term is kind of where we land within that kind of guidance band that I gave. So, still working on a way on the cost out programs and so on. We’ve got opportunities there, will flow through into the second half. But then it does -- it depends a lot on the normal product mix, geographic mix, a little bit on the acquisition around the edges, a little of a headwind for us. You’ve got typical declines or mix. So, that’s all in and I said a lot -- quite a lot, it’s pretty hard to predict on the gross margin when you’re looking at kind of 90-day window. But overall I think pretty comfortable with that margin even and clearly we’ll work hard to improve that but we’ve got to be realistic on what we’re seeing with product mix and geographic mix and acquisitions and so on. So rest assured we’re working hard on margin improvement.
Saul Hadassin: And just a follow-up on that regarding the ASV sales that you would have not had this quarter, was there any material change to those lost sales relative to the quarter that’s just passed, so relative to 1Q ‘16?
Mick Farrell: The ASV sales, as I said earlier, the impact that we saw in Q2 was the same as the impact we saw pretty much in Q1 for Europe. And the impact that we saw in the U.S. was much less than that that we saw in Europe which is again the identical situation to what we saw in Q1, so that you know it’s still going through the P&L being annualized. The impact of SERVE-HF results from May 2015 and we’re in mid January now, so we’ve got four more months of annualizing that through the P&L and then we’ll be clear with sort of annual cost of the ASV impact in May 2016 here in five months -- four months time from now.
Operator: And Margaret Kaczor of William Blair is online with a question. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Margaret Kaczor: So just to go back to Inova Labs and that acquisition, obviously they have a good product, they’ve got some good advantages. But that said, do you have an interest in bringing a new POC to market, that’s up to the same standards as ResMed, similar to what you guys did with Astral and Sans [ph] and should this be a shorter or longer timeframe or are you happy and willing to continue selling the existing products to your customers today?
Mick Farrell: Yes, thanks Margaret, good afternoon to you. That’s a good question. It allows us to talk to the longer term play here around Inova. So, Inova is a strong player in the POC market and they have excellent mobility and excellent freedom that they give back to patients because the battery life is best in class and lasts a very long time, similar to what we do with the Astral, lots of what where did 24 hours of freedom back to patients with that. Having said all that and as Rob alluded to earlier, there’s a lot of capabilities that we have from our global business in the 26 years in respiratory medicine here that we can bring some skills to the table for the next generation of products in the portable oxygen concentrator front. And some of that will be some of the engineering around efficiencies, our supply chain logistics, manufacturing, quality reliability and those types of factors that we’ve learned a lot. But really importantly bringing the capability or the core confidence of cloud based healthcare informatics solutions to the able to put a cloud-connected POC as part of end-to-end across the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medical device space, so all the way from noninvasive ventilators, life support ventilators and the portable oxygen concentrators and take that data and be able to give pulmonary and critical care physicians or ACOs data that can really help them understand mobility, freedom, breath right and hospitalization rights of their COPD patients to help them improve outcomes and lower cost. That’s the game. And we do think that we can bring a lot to the table. So the short answer is obviously we like the product, we will continue to sell existing products. But we like even more the combination of the Inova portable oxygen concentrator engineering with ResMed’s healthcare informatics engraining, what the two combinations, what that synergy could bring.
Margaret Kaczor: Okay, then I don’t know if you had talked at all about the timeframe because obviously it took you guys a little bit a time, sense to bring that kind of a product to market, so should we assume it’s within that 2020 timeframe or longer than that?
Mick Farrell: You should assume it within the 2020 timeframe for sure. Yes, the difference between stand, we have got life support ventilators where the life cycle of those is sort of six to seven or even up to eight to 10 years. The life cycle of a portable oxygen concentrator is probably closer to that of the C peptide type device or that sort of time horizon. So yes, we will have a next generation well before 2020.
Operator: And Joanne Wuensch of BMO Securities is on line with the question. Go ahead, your line is open.
Joanne Wuensch: Could we touch on SG&A please? Revenue was stronger than we expected but you really also pulled in your SG&A; what’s going on there?
Mick Farrell: Rob, do you want to just set maybe -- maybe Rob first, Brett and then you can go.
Rob Douglas: Joanne, actually we’ve got a number of areas that we are working on. Brett will probably go into few of them but across the board we are running a really strong operational excellence program that not only talks about our products and our supply chain, which we have talked about a lot but we are also moving a lot of that thinking and approach into our SG&A road as well. And so we have done a lot work around the world. We do run our different countries with different go to market models and so the different programs around the world. But we can really call out the U.S. and Americas teams of pulling a lot of operational leverage in and we have got very strong plans around our European teams. So, it’s really easy stuff for us to do, in terms of sharing the way some things work nice and easier. And we are taking a view of that we are freeing up a lot of capacity to continue to invest in innovation and really optimizing these acquisitions as well. So Brett, I don’t know if you want to go into little more on some of the areas.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. We’ve adopted to some extent some of the methodologies that they are using with the supply management team and so and being more disciplined around that. So that’s certainly helping a lot and just making sure kind of mindset is thinking to that extent as well in a smart way. And so that’s sort of enabled us to get some pretty solid leverage there. Obviously if you go back last year running, we had for example AirSense and selling and doing some marketing and some variable compensation, that’s more normalized this year, which has helped us a bit as well. And to some extent, you’re getting some currency benefit as well. But even if I normalize for currency, we still -- we see around that 27% mark. So, we’d still be in very good shape, some of those savings or kind of holding expenses tight. And then with revenue growth obviously you get that leverage. So that’s been -- we’ve been working on this for a while and I think it’s just sort of starting to flow through into the P&L now.
Joanne Wuensch: And just as a follow-up if I may, I think there is some pricing on Inova clearly going outside of your core OSA type of area into more sort of traditional DME type of oxygen concentrators, what made this be the right acquisition at this time? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: With respect to -- I’ll disagree that it’s not in our space. Our space is -- ResMed is respiratory medicine. And what we have done in the field of sleep apnea certainly for 25 years is lead that market, and most recently lead it by taking cost out through healthcare informatics and really showing we can improve the efficiencies of the delivery of this amazing noninvasive ventilation and positive airway pressure therapy to patients in sleep apnea. We’d already started within the fields of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with our noninvasive ventilators to help those patients as well, stay out of hospital and get better with COPD through noninvasive ventilation including publication of studies showing that we can actually reduce the mortality rate, so literally save lives of COPD patients with severe hypercapnic COPD with noninvasive ventilation through the current one study that we published. So the extension through that vertical, if you like of the disease state of COPD into the other medical device that is often used in that COPD space which is oxygen therapy. Now, we aren’t really doubling down in stationary oxygen, and it does have a stationary oxygen concentrator but it’s actually the only one in the world that the stationary oxygen concentrator can allow a portable oxygen concentrator to connect directly on to it and charge and be there, so that when the patient wants to leave the home. Because these folks are still active folks with COPD, they can grab the POC and see the grand children, get out to the park and play ball with the grand kids and have the freedom back, which is what POC is bringing. The total market for oxygen therapy is $1.2 billion or so, of that around $200 million plus or minus is a portable oxygen concentrator market, but it’s that $200 million portable oxygen concentrator market that has very strong growth, mid to high, even low-double-digit numbers growth in terms of year-over-year. We are really excited to participate in that POC market and to bring our innovation play. And we think it’s a very larger to extension into the vertical of COPD patient treatment and it will become a good -- a great part of our portfolio, not just in the U.S. where it primarily sales now, but globally.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall, UBS. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Just want to pick up on the mask, obviously it’s second quarter now that you’ve achieved quite good U.S. sales. Just want to understand sort of what’s been behind that; is conversion or I guess better pairings; is again conversion on the compliance rate that data that you’re showing? And then I guess Brett’s probably covered this a little bit, but just how I guess incrementally that continues remarkably that in the margin?
Mick Farrell: Okay. I’ll hand the first part of the question. 11% solid growth in masks and accessories in Americas and hand to Jim Hollingshead and then Brett maybe you take the second part of that.
Jim Hollingshead: Yes. There is a lot going on behind that mask number, just to be -- try to think about it. And the first thing is the price reductions that we’ve put into place in January to June [indiscernible] now completely annualized. So we’re through that. And while the market remains, the mask market in particular remains very competitive, we’re into more of a historic norm kind of pricing situation in masks. Our offering remains very strong in particular the AirFit line of masks are very well received and continues to do very, very well in the market. Our recent buy offerings have driven a lot of growth and that is directly connected to our health informatics offering because the acquisition of the providers that we’re now integrating into a program we called ResMed Resupply and that’s an automated resupply program, it’s part of our HI offering that’s helping to grow our mask business. And then we’ve done a number of things. We’ve done a number of -- without getting into the tactics, a number of things in marketing and a number of things with sales compensation and so on, and all of those leverages have contributed to the growth we saw.
Andrew Goodsall: And what you’re expecting gross margin…[Multiple Speakers]
Mick Farrell: Yes. Brett, you want to address the -- actually sort of a third question, why don’t you addresss the gross margin and then Jim or I will address the ongoing masks...
Brett Sandercock: So pretty simply, typically mask margins are higher than flow gen margins. So, to the extent you get stronger growth in mask obviously be supportive to group margin. So that’s kind of the pricing masks.
Jim Hollingshead: And in terms of where it goes, I think all the activities we have in place would suggest that that’s stable.
Operator: Steve Wheen of JP Morgan is online with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Well, thanks very much. The question for Brett, just on the FX typically in the positive given some indication on current exchange rates, what the gross margin impact might be going into third quarter? And then also you’ve often provided the FX impact at the impact [ph] line as well?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. So on gross margin going forward, assuming currently the way they are and they’re particularly volatile at the moment. But we probably sequentially probably get a small uptick but it will be only around 10 basis-point mark Steve, it’d be pretty small sequentially that is point in time. I mean all the sort of types it will be the trajectory and stays there and probably Q4 you’d see that impact on a sequential basis being a little bit bigger than Q3, but for Q3 I think it would be around 10 basis points. So kind of overall net impact from currencies, I do typically give it on EPS. And I think even the commentary was around [indiscernible] this quarter, as we’re starting to see some of that benefit from a lower Aussie dollar kind of kicking through, which is offset to some extent by the way to euro, but we are starting to see the benefit from the Aussie dollar now which is great.
Steve D. Wheen: And then just final follow-up. In the past, in the last quarter, you guided towards the effective tax rate going down by 100 basis points. You seem to sort of have changed the stats on that. Could you just give some reconciliation as to what might have changed there?
Brett Sandercock: It’s seats around the cost of H1, so probably in the vicinity of 20; it’s around that range Steve, on that. And just it varies around with the basically where the geographically taxable income is. And so we continue to have pretty good numbers out of the U.S. and that’s probably sort of moved it up a little bit. But in the vicinity of that 20%, I’ve just gone with 20 to 21. So maybe sort increase that a shade above where I was thinking from Q1.
Operator: And your next question is Sean Laaman on line from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman: I have a question on myAir, I’m just wondering if there’s any way you’ve been able to track or quantify the uptake and usage patterns from patients and any observable benefit to the company? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Great question, Sean. I mentioned that it’s actually now in our investor deck that we’re adding 750 patients per day to the myAir application. And myAir for those who don’t know is an app that can run on an iPhone or an Android, Samsung or whatever device, portable device where a patient can access and interact with their own therapeutic data from their device and trends and gaming and interaction with it. And in the same way that many people around the world are now measuring their steps either with a Fitbit or an embedded app in their Smartphone to try and get the 10,000 steps a day and keep the cardiovascular exercise up. A lot of patients now with myAir are looking to get their score to 100, because we literally give a score out of 100 everyday on how you slept. This includes duration of sleep, probably mask week and efficacy of the respiratory rate and so on throughout the evening. So, it’s an algorithm, if you like that score the patient’s wellness with regard to sleep and their treatment sleep apnea. We’ve seen incredible engagement from patients on it. I talked about 60% adherence going up to 87% adherence with some customers in the case studies from the JP Morgan presentation. I’d tell you a big part of that is engagement with the patients through these cloud-based algorithms that interact, email, text, IVR and psychologically work with patients through these cloud-based capabilities. So we’re really excited about myAir and we think it’s a big contributor. And we’re in mile one of a mask on this one. There’s a long way to go onto the capability for us to engage with patients.
Operator: Your last question in today’s question-and-answer session will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Go ahead your line is open.
Matt Taylor: So, I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on the acquisitions because you’re talking about them very excitedly but also they’re immaterial this quarter. You said Curative was about 1% last quarter, so two things. One is when do they become material as engines more material and then are you going to call them out separately for reporting purposes because most of us just have masks and flow generator models, so it’s hard to recognize.
Mick Farrell: So, I’ll let Brett talk to the first part of that materiality and then I’ll talk into a little bit as to why we’re excited about the long term.
Brett Sandercock: So, at this stage I mean it’s still not material from accounting stands and even on that aggregate there Matt, so at this stage we wouldn’t -- won’t disclose that in sort of any too much granularity. Now obviously, as we go forward and so on we’ll keep looking at how we report or disclose from a business perspective. But at this stage we’re going through pretty much the same channels and so on, we’ll continue to basically aggregate that into our results and not try to split that out.
Mick Farrell: And Matt, just to give you some sort of ballpark on it, we have mentioned that it’s less than 2% of our global revenues, so you can run the math on $1.7 billion that puts it at less than $34 million in revenues. We’re not going to go into exactly what number it is for competitive reasons. But take that number and then also think about the $200 million marker of POCs and think about what ResMed’s done, I guess if you look back over the last 20-25 years in the sleep apnea market where we started from a very small base and have grown to a very strong global leadership, number one position. We would look to do the same in POCs and how we look to do that is the same way we did in sleep apnea, which is innovation and technology. And I talked a lot about the innovation in healthcare informatics and engaging patients. Applying that to POCs we think is a huge opportunity and we’re very excited about being a major player in the POC market, and really importantly rolling that up to a major play around COPD, which is the number three killer in the United States, and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in ERs and ICUs and CCUs. So we think it’s a huge opportunity and we look to be a part of that.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. I’ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Susan. So, in closing I want to thank the more than 4,300 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I’m very proud of what our team has accomplished in creating market leading innovation and connected care, including new product lines, new solutions, new channels that we’ve incorporated into our business portfolio. We remain laser focused on our long-term goal of impacting 20 million lives by 2020. And that impact is literally giving the gift of breath back to each of those patients. Thanks for your time and we’ll talk to you in 90 days.
Agnes Lee: All right, thank you again for joining us today for this call. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Susan, you may now close the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes ResMed’s second quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 Fiscal Year 2016 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee - Senior Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Melissa, and thank you, everyone, for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, as well as performance.

I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our fiscal Q1 2016 quarterly results. We have started the year with very strong sales growth in both our sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business. In my remarks, I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, some regional highlights from our global business, as well as an overview of the progress that we have made against our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that, as usual, I will hand over to Brett to walk you through the financial results in greater detail. Once again, this quarter, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency of 15%. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth, and we achieved solid steady growth our combined EMEA and APAC group. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep apnea and our respiratory care businesses. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.57 on a GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investment growth opportunities whilst carefully managing our growth in R&D and SG&A. We gained operating leverage this quarter, as both R&D as well as SG&A grew at a lower rate than our top line revenue. We are on track to further increase operating leverage throughout fiscal year 2016 and we are executing on our plans to improve gross margin, driving further efficiency improvements in both manufacturing and supply chain costs, as I outlined last quarter. We have a lot of runway left for ongoing growth of our high margin product businesses, including the AirCurve 10 bilevel platform and our Astral life support ventilation platform. As we look forward over the coming fiscal quarters and the fiscal year, we will further leverage our automated informatics solutions to drive ongoing mask and accessories resupply growth. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had a very strong sales performance in Q1, with our team driving north of 20% growth on a year-on-year basis. Flow generator growth was 39%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and our Astral platforms, as well as our end-to-end Healthcare Informatics solutions. Mask and accessories grew at 9% during the quarter in the Americas. Pricing continues to be stable in the mask categories. We continue to expect positive mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016. Moving on to our combined EMEA and APAC group, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators and our mask and accessory businesses in the EMEA and APAC group. Clearly, the SERVE-HF results and our contraindication for ASV in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea patients was a headwind. ASV sales in Europe were more affected than we had predicted. However, it is important to note that ASV sales in APAC and the U.S. were significantly less affected than in Europe. We have not seen any impact beyond our ASV sales for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in predominant central sleep apnea. This is consistent with the conclusions from the New England Journal of Medicine publication and the commentary from key opinion leaders in The Lancet, in CHEST, and in the Blue journal, all stating that the data from the study should not be extrapolated beyond the treatment group. It just makes good sense. APAC sales were strong in the quarter and we continue to see robust growth across all of our high growth markets this quarter, including China. We announced earlier this month that we have now completed the acquisition of Curative Medical. This partnership of our ResMed China business and the Curative Medical team provides us with a leading market share position in China and a separate brand with innovative products that are developed and manufactured in China for China. This acquisition will allow us to expand both the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets in China and beyond. Now I'd like to talk more about our progress against our ResMed 2020 Three Horizons Growth Strategy. Earlier this month, ResMed was a platinum sponsor for the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, and the meeting was held right here in San Diego. AdvaMed is the world's largest med tech association and its conference is the most important in the med tech industry globally. One of the main themes of AdvaMed 2015 was the increasing importance of digital health for medical devices and connected care for patients. ResMed has been at the very forefront of healthcare informatics innovation for over a decade. We are leading and driving this trend for our industry. Just over one year after the launch of the Air Solutions Platform and the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10, we have well over 1 million patients with cloud-connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables. As these devices provide daily updates to the cloud, it allows ResMed to provide actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers. We have built an industry-leading core competency in healthcare informatics allowing us to provide the best value with market-leading solutions that improve operational efficiency, improve patient adherence and improve long-term outcomes for patients. Our customers clearly understand the value proposition of ResMed's Air Solutions. Most of the time, we cannot talk publicly about these results, but one of our customers has allowed us to report on their increased staff efficiency and accelerated business growth after adopting Air Solutions from ResMed. Based on their own data, this customer is saving 80 labor hours per month, reducing the number of unreached patients by more than 85% and increasing the number of new patient setups by 55% on a year-over-year basis. These results are a big part of why so many customers are partnering with ResMed. We have many other examples of customer success using our healthcare informatics solutions. U-Sleep is the ResMed-branded cloud-based application that monitors patient adherence and automatically identifies and triages which patients need the most help so that a homecare provider can proactively address issues and provide better care. In a previous investor call, I talked about a study presented at the American Thoracic Society in which a U-Sleep customer saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83% along with a 59% decrease in their labor costs. To prove that this was not a one-time, one-customer event, let me provide an overview of a study just published in the Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research. This study showed that by using adherence coaching from U-Sleep, the customer was able to increase compliance from 60% using standard adherence monitoring up to 87% using the automated compliance monitoring capabilities of our U-Sleep solution. In addition to this 27% increase in the number of adherent patients on therapy, the customer staff was able to set up 83% more patients at the same labor cost. This is clearly a very significant operating efficiency improvement for our customer. The acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added new capabilities to our end-to-end solution that we call ResMed ReSupply. This capability provides automated resupply solutions for our customers so that they can efficiently manage mask and accessory resupply to patients through automated text, email or interactive voice response, with a multilingual call center backing up the solution live, if necessary. We have seen great success with the Air Solutions platform and devices, and we will continue to build our healthcare informatics capabilities so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings, drive appropriate growth in masks and accessories provision to patients, and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we see opportunities to leverage the healthcare informatics strength from our sleep apnea business directly into our adjacent respiratory care businesses. We are already taking AirCurve 10 data to the cloud, and you will hear more from us on this front as we move forward. Watch this space. We are expanding our presence in the U.S. respiratory care market and building on our strong presence in Europe for both our life support ventilation solutions, and our non-invasive ventilation solutions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular disease. Another growth vector under our second horizon of growth is our ongoing investments in high growth market geographies. With the completion of the Curative Medical acquisition, we are now the market share leader in the sleep apnea and respiratory care market in China. We are extremely well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, with two strategically aligned, yet operationally independent teams targeting different, yet fast-growing customer segments within the China market. We continue to invest in high growth markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. In each geography, we provide and drive long-term strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall system healthcare costs within each individual country, proving on that promise with hard data. Finally, let's review our third horizon of growth. Let me first spend a few moments talking about SERVE-HF. As you all know, ResMed put patient safety first and foremost. It was the most important priority when we announced the preliminary study results from SERVE back in May, many months before the study was eventually published. As we had expected, the SERVE-HF study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine quite recently. The study's primary investigators presented results at the European Society of Cardiology and at the European Respiratory Society conferences. The results of the study, the safety signal, and the contraindication remain unchanged from May. It is worth noting that our ASV business in other market segments has been unaffected in these last five months since the SERVE-HF announcement. These other segments include treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, time-management-induced central sleep apnea, and post-traumatic stress disorder-related uses of ASV. These all remain strong market segments in the U.S., and we are working on expanding these applications further through Europe and Asia Pacific. Our third horizon of growth includes a number of cardio-respiratory treatment opportunities, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and chronic disease management opportunities in cardiology. These are very exciting longer-term opportunities that we will speak more about later. Returning to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. In this quarter, we bought back 1.2 million shares in addition to funding our dividend. Through September 30, our stock repurchase program has returned to shareholders a total of $1.5 billion. It's your cash and we think you should get it back. We continue to look for potential acquisitions where three key criteria are met; one, the business is aligned with our long-term strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed's shareholder value; and three, that there is a cultural fit between the acquisition target business and ResMed's team. We hit all of these three criteria solidly with the Curative Medical acquisition, and we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we look forward. At ResMed, we are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but, more importantly, in products and informatics solutions innovation, as well as in service, channel, and market innovation. We remain very excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners, and, most importantly, for many, many millions of patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett, for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter was $411.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, where in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $26.8 million in the first quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $254.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC group totaled $157.5 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC group increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas' flow generator sales were $132.1 million, an increase of 39% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in the combined EMEA and APAC group, flow generator sales were $107.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $50 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 58%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 440 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, an unfavorable geographic mix, and adverse currency movements. Looking forward, in fiscal year 2016, we still expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. If gross margin drivers like currency fluctuation and geographic and product mix move beyond their expectations, they could swing this range further. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to progressively see the benefits from our cost out programs, including procurement, production, and logistics improvements, reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. In particular, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect to see a benefit from a normalized sea/air freight mix and from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and the impact of recent acquisitions. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, including informatics solutions, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, compared to 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. You may recall in the prior-year tax rate, this was favorably impacted by a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the conclusion of a long-running German tax audit. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 19% to 20%. Operating profit for the quarter was $98 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. However, net income for the quarter declined by 3% to $80.4 million as a result of foreign currency hedging losses and lower interest income. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share were consistent with the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.4 million, while depreciation/amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.4 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for the consideration of $62 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 14.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In October, we announced the closing of the Curative acquisition. We have not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction. The acquisition has been funded by utilizing our existing cash balances, and the entity will be included in our consolidated results in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the rolling 12 months ended September 30, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to shareholders for our dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 99% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $321 million. And at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee - Senior Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Melissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could perhaps talk through the guidance a little bit. There's been some changes. So I think at the full year result you talked about an SG&A range of 27% to 28%. That's come down by 100 basis points. And the tax rate guidance has also come down by 100 basis points as well. I'm just wondering what's changed in the last three months to see those things come down.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brett, do you want to have a go at that?
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I'll take that, Mick. Thanks. Yeah, Ian, that's right, we have guided that down a little in SG&A. As Mick mentioned, we've been focused on the operating leverage throughout the group and we do think we can achieve that through fiscal year 2016. So with some of the plans we have, we do believe that we can bring that down a little and provide some operating leverage there. So on the SG&A front, we feel confident we should bring that guidance down where we see some improvements we're planning throughout the year. On the effective tax rate, it moves around a bit with geographic mix. If you look at last year's sort of full-year underlying tax rate, it was sort of around that 19.5% level. So it's kind of in that range. So we just brought that down a tad just based on where we see the forecast going out.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Okay. And then in a similar vein, you mentioned the gross margin. You kept that guidance the same, but you did sort of flag that various movements could see you go out of the range. It is a very wide range and this result was pretty much in the middle of the range. I'm just wondering what sort of things could drive it materially outside that range.
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: We did widen that a little bit, Ian, really because there's, if you look at it over the last year or so, quite a bit of volatility on exchange rates. For example, you're seeing the Aussie come down something like 7%, 8%, which is quite significant. Now I'm not suggesting that that's going to happen again this year, but, as you know, anything is possible. And we're also seeing some pretty significant movements or some big outperformance on flow generators, particularly in the U.S. So I suppose as a caveat, there's always quite a bit of volatility around the gross margin. It's probably the hardest number to predict. So we widened that out a little bit. I think as we get through the course of the fiscal year, we can probably get some more confidence on sort of the band or how wide that is. But at this stage early in the fiscal, we've left it as is. But I have said there that certainly on the things such as freight, where we are normalizing that now, certainly doing a lot less air freight as we have the inventories at levels that we think are appropriate. That's certainly going to help us into Q2. And, as you know, the Aussie dollar has depreciated more recently. There's about a quarter's lag on that, so we don't really see that benefit until Q2. But that benefit will be meaningful as well going into Q2. I guess some of the headwinds we're facing are kind of abating a little bit, and so we should be able to see some improvements throughout fiscal year 2016.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.
Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative commentary on what helped the mask growth this quarter. I mean, you had, I guess, a little bit of easier comp, but certainly saw some acceleration there. If you could talk about any products or trends or pull-through, things that might help us to understand how the mask growth could progress.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the mask business in total. I mean, what we've seen over the last three quarters is clearly some good growth turnaround and success in masks. It's not driven by brand new products; it's more driven by us focusing on partnering with our customers around understanding resupply. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we've invested a lot these last 12 months in getting well over 1 million bedside tables with 100% cloud-connected devices that now enable us to have information on patients. And we're able to take those data to the cloud and contact patients and encourage them and drive patient adherence and work with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our other partners in other countries around the world to give patients appropriate access to masks and accessories as they need them over the time of their therapy. And I think you're just seeing the very start of the roadmap of us working on those informatics systems and leveraging them to drive mask and accessories resupply, but I think that's been a factor in the equation. As you said, the comp was not incredibly difficult. And so having 9% growth in the Americas over the comp is somewhat a result of that comp. But I think it's more due to the fact that we're focused on resupply, we're partnering with our customers on it and we're really establishing tools and capabilities that are automated, scalable and replicable. And so that gives us a long runway throughout the fiscal year to be able to drive resupply in masks and accessories.
Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And just to follow up on that, could you give us any metrics that you're tracking or some kind of a guidepost on resupply to help us understand the improvements you've made and maybe where you could go? I don't know if it's masks per year or how you think about it? And then you mentioned price was stable in masks. Any changes outside the U.S.? I think your comment was on the Americas.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead, who's probably closer to the business and any metrics we're looking at from the resupply, but we may or may not want to release that.
James Hollingshead - President-Americas: I don't think we'd want to talk about metrics that we put on the resupply business. I think what I'd add to Mick's comments about the Americas market, in particular on masks, is that we've been talking for several months about the pricing strategy we made a while ago. And those pricing changes have now annualized, so one of the things that allowed us to show a better revenue growth number this quarter was the pricing has really stabilized for us. We're the mask market leader both in the Americas and globally. In particular, our Air Fit range is very well positioned. And so we continue to enjoy good volume growth just in the mask business with patients getting – new patients getting masks. And then, with the efforts we made in automating resupply and driving resupply, we've enjoyed the growth on the back end of that, but I don't think we want to get into sort of ratios and metrics on that at this point.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And maybe the second part of the question, which focused beyond the U.S., the global aspects, Rob Douglas, our COO, any thoughts on that?
Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Matt. Globally, the masks are performing well. The AirFit range is a very strong mask range, and we are very competitive with those masks. Our teams work hard with our customers and they've got strong relationships around the world. And we're confident those masks are going to keep performing strongly.
Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if we could get a bit of a guide on device growth ex-ASV, if possible.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sean, I don't think we're going to release a new metric on this earnings call. I mean, the bottom line is, as we said in May, less than 7% of our global business is in the ASV side of the business, and it's obviously reduced from that over these last sort of 150 days. The growth that we saw – pretty phenomenal growth of 39% in the Americas, flow generators, and on a constant currency basis, 5% growth of flow generators in EMEA and APAC combined – was driven really by the new launch of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 and the Astral. And so those have been driving the growth. Europe clearly had a bit of a headwind due to the contraindication for heart failure patients with a reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea, where we issued that contraindication. But as I also said in the prepared remarks, we really have not seen any impact on ASV beyond that in the other market segments, if you like, that we sell the product in. So it's been pretty steady in that. But, Sean, yeah, I don't want to start breaking out ASV and non-ASV mask growth for competitive reasons, and also just for the fact of – we've got quite a lot of runway left on those product launches, and I want to just look at the macro numbers as they come out.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Sure, Mick. Thanks. Can I just squeeze one more in? Just to clarify, with respect to mask pricing in the U.S., is that fully lapped yet, or is it a next quarter event when it's fully lapped, the reduction in mask pricing?
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Sean, yeah, you're referring to, I think, the January through June 2014 price changes, which have now lapped because we passed – we lapped the June 2015 timeframe. So we are now fully lapped on those ASP reductions and we're back to sort of steady, as we said, pretty steady mask pricing. And we're seeing often our competitors out there competing on value of what the masks can achieve in terms of patient fit, quiet, comfort, first time fit and patient acceptance.
Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.: Great, Mick. Thanks. That's all I had. Appreciate your time.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj, your line is open. Your next question comes from Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you can please talk to the different market growth you're seeing in the U.S. between flow gens and masks. Do you think the market for both categories is growing at a slightly decent rate? And if so, what are some of the trends that are driving that/ Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'll start at a high level and then hand over to Jim maybe for some detail. Globally, we see the sleep apnea market in general growing in the mid-single digits. As you saw from these numbers, we don't accept market growth. We drive ResMed growth and we want to meet or beat those market growth numbers. And so we were able to beat across our businesses, able to beat both mid-single-digit numbers in flow generators and in masks. The commentary I'd make before handing to Jim is that the high flow generator numbers we saw particularly in the Americas were driven by new product launches, and a lot of that was share gain based upon the value prop of the Informatics systems, the air solutions that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So, less to do with the differential between flow gens and masks, they are more to do with the value prop of air solutions. But, Jim, any more color from the rest of the market, the Americas market?
James Hollingshead - President-Americas: Yeah, I think that's spot on. I think the difference you see in the numbers is we've, on a longstanding basis, been the mask market leader. But with the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10, we've taken significant market share over the last several months since the launch of both of those product lines. And that's due both to the fact that those product platforms, just as products, as flow generators, are outstanding products. But really it's about, as Mick has just said and said in his opening comments, it's about the all-in solutions offer, the Air Solutions platform is driving significant revenue growth in business efficiencies for our customers, and they're recognizing that. And as they continue to recognize that and adopt the overall Air Solutions platform, they're of necessity buying more of our flow generators to enjoy those benefits. So really there's not a separate growth number behind those two product categories. The underlying market growth is the same, we're just taking more share in flow gen.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And are you seeing any change in the way private insurers are funding or reimbursing CPAP in terms of moving from a fee-for-product model to perhaps a capitation or a per-patient model? Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, the U.S. market particularly is evolving from a fee-for-service market to really a value-driven or a fee-for-value driven market as a whole. And you're seeing more models like the Kaiser Permanente model, the Intermountain Healthcare model, the Geisinger model start to come into play. And the government is trying to replicate those really solid private company payer provider models with its accountable-care organization or ACO models and its IDN models. And we are very good partners with Kaiser, with Intermountain Health, and with Geisinger. But also with the governments of the United Kingdom, the governments of Sweden, the governments of Norway, the governments of Finland, where a payer provider model has been in place for many decades. Since World War II, almost all of Western Europe adopted socialized medicine systems, public health care. And we've been working for the last 25 years with systems of fee-for-value or providing value models. And so we're very used to that type of environment. So the U.S. is undergoing an evolution. Are we a part of that evolution? And I think the informatics capability that we have, the ability to take data to the cloud and share it with patients to drive adherence is amazing, to take costs out of the system for the providers is very valuable. But the data to do population health management for a payer or a payer-provider is an opportunity through our data exchanges that we are really just starting to extrapolate. So I think your question is probably a little bit ahead of the curve as to where the value is, but we are working with systems in this new payer-provider, fee-for-value model. And we're actually really excited about that transition because our market shares are incredibly strong across Western Europe and we think we can do that in all the payer-provider models that are out there.
William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Victor Windeyer with Citi. Your line is open.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Hi, guys. Thanks. Well, I just wanted to ask a few things related to the ASV product. So you drew out that the pullback in Europe has been a little bit larger, a little harder than you had expected, and that Asia and Americas were in line with your expectations. I just wonder with Asia given the high use of ASV in the high (39:12) population, first, you had with the positive reimbursement in that location. Do you expect further pullback in Japan as awareness of SERVE-HF results close out through there? And then is the Curative Medical acquisition and revenue and associated gross profit enough to offset that should that occur? And then in terms of the preserved ejection fraction population that you mentioned, what's happening with the CAT-HF study given the mixed population of that enrolled patient population there?
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Victor. Well, that was a great way to get three questions in one, so I'll try to address all of that, Vic. Yeah. The first part of your question was about the ASV impact being more in Europe and less in Americas and Asia. And I think part of the genesis of your question or the core of the question, kernel of the question was, is it just that the communication is taking time to get from Europe to Asia or Europe to the Americas, and the answer to that is an emphatic no. We have, in all the 100 countries we do business in, been incredibly proactive in working with the physician groups, directly writing letters to physician groups and to physicians, working with our providers to contact all physicians and let everybody know about the field safety notice, and that was in the month of May, so north of five months ago now. And so that information has been available not only at all the international societies, but in national societies, in all the countries we do business in, and particularly the major ones. So, really, it's not a result of – the fact that there's been less impact in Asia and Americas is not a result that the communication hasn't gone out there. It's a result of the fact that there was, frankly, less heart failure referrals into our ASV business in those countries. Particularly if you look at the U.S., it was primarily at our business year in the U.S. that was driven by complex sleep apnea or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea driven by opioid-induced central sleep apnea and driven by PTSD, where ASV was used in those applications. And so, there was just less of the business that was coming from cardiology referrals, and so that just wasn't impacted. Within Japan – you mentioned Japan specifically – the use of ASV in Japan is focused on an acute basis in the hospital. And these data were based on longitudinal data in the home with no data at all about acute effect, and there have been some studies with mutual outcomes on safety but some positive outcomes on some heart failure indicator results, such as ejection fraction and others. And so, the use in Japan has sort of continued on an acute basis because it's a different application. And I don't think that will be affected by SERVE-HF and their ongoing work with Japanese researchers in the field to keep proving their safety but also the efficacy of the product in that area. The next part of your question was Curative. Is Curative going to materially offset some of this ASV decline that we're seeing in different parts of the world. I'll hand to Rob. Rob is leading the charge on the Curative integration.
Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. So, Vic, the Curative acquisition was part of our Three Horizons Strategy, specifically in the second horizon. Talking about positioning ourselves to grow in these markets that look like they're going to be very high growth markets, we only completed the acquisition at the beginning of October, so we're about three weeks into it at the moment. I could say it's going very well at the moment. We're just at the CMEF, China Medical Equipment, today. It's a huge medical equipment fair in China. And we had – showing off our strategy as strategically aligned but operationally independent, we had ResMed and Curative side by side in booths but strongly showing their respective brands, and we're seeing reaction in that market to the two brands that's appropriate for what we look like. So at this stage, we're very confident that that program is going to go well.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the third part of your question, Vic, was to do with HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and our CAT-HF study. The CAT-HF study is really a pilot study now. We've closed off enrollment and we're going to follow through on all the patients and collect the data from that and likely publish those data as a pilot trial for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction work that we may do in the future. I think between atrial fibrillation, to some extent coronary artery disease in a number of markets, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may remain exciting, cardio-respiratory conditions that we are looking at. Given what happened in there, we're unlikely to do a five-year $50 million study in each of these three areas. What we're likely to do is partner with payer providers like those I mentioned earlier or governments or small payer-provider groups to run pilot trials to show improved outcomes and improved reduction in hospitalizations on a commercialized basis. So you run pilots that you get commercially paid for that can produce clinical data that may or may not get published but allows you to expand the model. And that's sort of where we're thinking for those three areas. So that includes HFpEF, AF and CAD.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thanks very much for that. I just as my follow-up, I'll just ask, is there any evidence that the result from an acute hospitalized heart failure population will be different from the population that's been studied in SERVE?
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there is, Vic, some indication of that. There was a study published called SAVIOR that was run out of Japan that showed a neutral safety signal but some positive data on the clinical aspects, such as ejection fraction, fluid in the lungs and length of stay in hospital. And so there's some clinical publications in that area on acute HF. You'll likely see more coming out from the Japanese researchers on that front over time.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much. Just on masks, you talked of steady state. We're now at steady state in the U.S. Does that mean we can think of high-single digit mask growth as we look forward?
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Vic, you're jumping to five questions here now, but I'll answer it and then we'll move on. The masks growth that we saw in the U.S. of 9% this quarter was clearly very solid. Look, the market is growing in the sort of mid-single digits range. We look to meet or beat that. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're planning for positive mask and accessories growth throughout the year and we're excited and looking forward to that. Thanks a lot for your questions, Vic.
Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: As a reminder, please limit your question to one and one follow-up. Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. So first maybe, Mick, if you can talk about what gives you guys confidence that you can really grow generators now in the face of a potential competitive launch from Respironics. If you guys have seen anything in the field and maybe some of those guys coming back to Air Solutions that have trialed that or if (47:04) is active in that HCIT-based device yet.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Margaret. Yeah, clearly, we have seen launch from one of our competitors. The other one you mentioned hasn't launched an HCIT product yet or a cloud-connected sleep apnea product yet and we don't expect in the short term. I'm going to start out by saying it's a huge compliment I think to our innovation and our leadership in the field that our competitors are talking about and starting to follow us into cloud-connected sleep apnea devices. We think it's (47:44-48:07) right way to go, we think that the value we extracted, like I talked about, we can improve outcomes and lower costs for the channel and take out waste and inefficiency and get patients more on therapy and follow up with them more to provide appropriate mask and accessories. So I just think as an industry, it's a really good thing that we're all moving to compete on value and drive healthcare informatics-driven sleep apnea solutions. Look, clearly maintaining a 39% Americas growth in flow generators in a market where, as I said, it's growing at mid-single digits, it's unrealistic to stay at those types of levels and I don't think you or any of the other sell-side analysts, Margaret, have numbers at that exact 39% sort of rate. But clearly our goal is to not only lock in the share that we already got, but to continue to meet or beat market growth rates, which means by taking share. So that really comes down to is our value proposition better than the competition. And from what we've seen of the first competitor to launch their cloud-connected devices is that, frankly, they're not 100% cloud connected. It's got three SKUs of widgets that you need to plug in with three different connectivity modules, which is SKUs for the HMEs to manage. It's not 100% cloud-connected out of the gate in that the DME or the HME or the patient has to take some action to provide the connectivity to the cloud. So we think while it's following us in the strategic direction, some of the tactical implementations are not as good as ours. And, really importantly, even when you are connected, it comes down to then competition of whose cloud is better. And I think our healthcare informatics capability on Air Solutions is clearly the leader now. And we intend to maintain that leadership by regular updates, regular value that we provide to both patients, to providers, to physicians and to payers. So we're really excited about the new basis of competition of the industry. It's changed from being just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected and then better connected. So we look forward to that, Margaret.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then for my follow-up, Brett, you talked about maybe seeing more of a shift to a normalization for air/sea freight next quarter. So how far along were you guys this past quarter? Did you see any benefit from those cost-outs? Thanks.
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Margaret, the programs are in place in a number of initiatives that the team is working on for sure and have got back to that in earnest. We're sort of over that hump of making sure we matched our supply with demand, so we're through all that and we're working through. Typically, what we do with the new platforms is then drive a pretty solid cost-out program on that new platform. So we're now in the throes of doing that. You probably – maybe a little bit but really, I think more of that will flow through over the course of 2016. And it will be, as I said earlier, it will be more progressive throughout the year, I think.
Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Yes. Good morning. Just a question on gross margin again. Brett, in the past because of that one quarter lag, you've kind of indicated as to what sort of basis-point improvement we might see from FX in the next quarter. Is that something you could comment on today?
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I mean, the sequential impact there if – and I'm going to caveat this because the exchange rate is moving around all the time – but if you looked at it on the current exchange rate, it's – probably the sequential benefit of the weaker Aussie – it's in the order of 50 basis points, give or take. It's that sort of quantum.
Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. And then as part of your gross margin commentary. You indicated that mix shift obviously was going against you but also ASP declined. Could you just provide some more color as to where those declines were being felt and what the drivers were?
Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I mean, it's not – we're not giving a lot of granularity around ASP, obviously, from a competitive perspective and so on. But as Mick and Jim mentioned earlier, we've kind of let through – some of those more kind of acute adjustments we were facing on pricing, we're through that now, so it's very much more of a kind of a typical or historical type marketplace in terms of pricing. So there's still, year-on-year, still an element of declines in selling prices and so on, but they're certainly, in today's environment, much less acute than what we were facing back 12 months ago, for example. So let me say it's kind of a more of a kind of historical normal state of play.
Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Thanks very much, guys. I was just going to talk to the SG&A. Obviously, up 11% constant currency, and you mentioned some investment in, I guess, emerging markets. Just trying to get a sense of that investment, whether there's much or so in your established markets like EU, and I guess the sort of payback period you're looking for with that investment, I guess, to grow those markets.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good question, Andrew. I'll hand it to Rob Douglas.
Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. So, obviously, Andrew, you know we've made some acquisitions in Australia last year, which were a bit of a change in our market model, and that's going very well for us. And then obviously the Curative that we talked about. But sort of on a case-by-case basis, our strategy is we will continue to invest locally for the local market development as appropriate, and we've got very strong teams around there. And then we're sort of challenging that with trying to get efficiency with common core processes that let us leverage really the key product range through there.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Terrific. And I guess just a quick follow-up. I know it's been a bit of mention around your competitor's entry to the market. I guess we're expecting that to take place at Medtrade this coming week. Just trying to understand if you've got particular strategies or variations that you bring to the market, I guess, just as a response or to coincide with those events.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question, Andrew. Clearly, this is a public conference call. So if we have strategies, tactics, and plans to compete with a very clearly known 12-month anticipated product launch, it's not something we'd go through on the earnings call here. But look, the bottom line is, of course, we're ready for competition in this space. As I sort of talked to on the response to Margaret earlier, we're quite complimented and excited about the fact that the new base of the competition is healthcare informatics and how good your cloud is. And we're really excited about how strong Air Solutions is, and the value that we provide. How well we have done, frankly, the last 12 months of getting north of a million devices out there, connected to the cloud and providing value to those customers. And we know that they've seen the value. Of course they're going to try and sample a new product out there. And we do think that the share we've gained will be something that we build upon because of the value that we're providing. But it's a competitive game and we look forward to it and we're ready for it.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: I know it's adding to the question, probably wasn't phrased particularly well. But I guess the feedback we're getting with the cloud is quite a sticky proposition in a way it wasn't in the past. The flow generator, I guess, just sort of seeing how much you think that gives you a bit of a stronger defense than what you might have had in the past.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Look, I think the value is incredible. I mean, I talked about in the last call, 59% labor cost savings. I talked about on this call, 83% more patient setup with the same labor cost. I mean, these numbers are incredible and these are just the ones that customers have said that it's okay for us to talk about because they're in markets where they sort of have stronger control and they're comfortable sharing those data. The ones in competitive markets are getting similar results and don't want to share the data. Jim, I mean, you're closer to the business on this. Do you want to share any further anecdotes?
James Hollingshead - President-Americas: Yeah, I think it's a really good question, Andrew. We feel very confident that we have a superior offer. We're getting what you might term a lot of customer loyalty off of the offer because of the value that it's driving. The device is a better device. It's simpler to use. It's simpler to set up. It has a very elegant and reliable cloud connection built into it, so it's not complex to get a connection to the cloud; and then our software offerings are the only offerings on the market that are proven to increase compliance and therefore increase revenue and to lower costs. And so we feel very confident. As Mick said, it's actually good for the market for the basis of competition in sleep apnea to shift towards health informatics because it provides end-to-end care for patients. It will provide better bang for the buck for the entire healthcare system. And it puts us in a very good position because we've enjoyed more than a year long lead in that now, and we'll continue to press that lead, so we feel very confident.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.: Terrific. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. You said, Mick, in your prepared remarks that you had the highest market share globally. I'd be very interested to know what you think your market share is and how you derive that number. That's my first question.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, David. Absolutely willing and happy to say that we are the market share leader. I don't want to go – we're in 100 countries, and I don't want to go into individual countries or individual market shares within any of those individual countries. But as you've seen these really, really strong high double-digit growth numbers over these last four quarters in flow generators and look at the number of devices that we've sold and the market share and your assessment of the market. I think you'd be pretty confident, and pretty much every sell-side analyst out there would be pretty confident that we're the market share leader in not only flow generators, but also in masks globally. But we don't sort of want to go into the details of it, David, for competitive reasons. Look, the main thing about market leadership is not just the market share leadership but the fact that you're innovating better and driving value. And I think one of the core parts of this is providing value for the end users in this whole system, who are the patients. We provide the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, and most connected care altogether to patients, and I think that's what's really driving our growth and leadership. And frankly, it's a challenge for us and anyone else playing in the field to continue to do that. And that's what the game is going to be going forward, providing that long term value to patients.
David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.: Thank you. And I wonder if you could give us an update, basically following on from previous questions, can you give us an idea of the replenishment, the mask replenishment environment in the U.S. in terms of payers? Are payers more or less willing to see mask replenishment than perhaps they were even a year or two years ago? Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, David. Replenishment is a really important part of sleep apnea care because the masks do degrade over time and become more leaky. And to have a patient on sleep apnea care – for a payer who is following it properly, a payer provider who is following it properly, the investment of $100-odd on a mask every six months to keep a patient out of hospital where a visit to a hospital can cost $2,000 to $3,000 to $5,000 just walking in the door and spending one day there. The return on investment for our payer providers who are really following this model closely amongst their sleep apnea patients, their COPD patients, their neuromuscular disease patients, their (1:01:08) patients, the ROI is a no-brainer when you've got the data. I think our informatics solutions are allowing us to have the data to provide the payer-providers and show that ROI. And so, I think you are transitioning from sort of a world of utilization management, where people just think of unit costs in a fee-for-service world, to a world of care management where people are thinking about holistic costs to the patient and what it costs to not provide the diabetes supplies or to not provide the hypertensive meds or to not provide the sleep apnea mask. And it's saying, I'm going to cut back on diabetes supplies to save myself money when then the diabetic is back in the hospital or to cut back on the number of masks and, therefore, have the sleep apnea patients show up at the hospital is sort of a 1980s way of looking at things in the utilization management front. So I think we are seeing that transition and I think that the payers are really moving to that world of ACOs and payer-providers and looking to mimic the model of those successful payer-providers. But it's a transition world and we are playing in both the fee-for-service world and in the care management world and balancing between the two very carefully.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks a lot, Melissa. And thanks for all the good questions. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished in creating the market-leading innovation in connected care and healthcare informatics solutions in our medical devices. And we remain focused on our long-term goal of changing 20 million patient lives by 2020. Thanks a lot and we'll talk to you all in 90 days.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-07-30 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Agnes Lee – Senior Director of Investor Relations Michael Farrell – Chief Executive Officer Brett Sandercock – Chief Financial Officer James Hollingshead – President, Americas Robert Douglas – President, Chief Operating Officer David Pendarvis – Chief Administrative Office
Analysts: Andrew Goodsall – UBS Ben Andrew – William Blair Anthony Petrone – Jefferies Steve Wheen – JPMorgan Matthew Prior – Evans & Partners Bruce Du – CBA Matthew O'Brien – Piper Jaffray Matthew Taylor – Barclays Ian Abbott – Goldman Sachs David Low – Deutsche Bank Joanne Wuensch – BMO Securities
Operator: Welcome to the Q4 2015 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kelly, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Kelly, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today, are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners now that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we finished our fiscal year with robust performance in both our core sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business as well as a return to solid growth for our mask products. In my remarks I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, regional highlights from our global business, and an update regarding our long-term strategy. I'll also provide high level summaries of two recent acquisitions, first CareTouch, a healthcare informatics acquisition that we announced just a few weeks ago; and second, an investment that we made and announced just earlier today, a few minutes ago, it went over the wire with Curative Medical. Finally I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail, and then we'll get to Q&A. As you saw in our press release, our global team achieved double-digit revenue growth up 17% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. This is our best performance in over four years, and quite an achievement on the robust foundation of the $1.7 billion global business. Our team performed incredibly well. In our Americas region we achieved double-digit revenue growth, and in our combined European and Asia Pac region we achieved solid mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep and respiratory care businesses. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis. Our global team produced excellent top line growth this quarter, and we have been balancing our investments in growth opportunities while managing costs in R&D and SG&A. As you look ahead to our fiscal year 2016, we believe that we can achieve further operating leverage in both R&D and SG&A. Brett will talk about gross margin guidance in more detail in his remarks, but I would like to outline three areas for efficiency that are critical to our FY 2016 plans. First, we are moving more and more of our shipping volume from air freight to sea freight as we continue to ramp our product launches. Second, we are reducing supply chain costs with significant and sustained internal and external cost-out programs throughout FY 2016. And third, we continue to grow incremental manufacturing volume in our lower cost plants. In addition, we have also established sales plans for accelerated growth in our high margin products throughout FY 2016 and beyond, including the AirCurve 10 variable platform and the Astral Life Support Ventilation platform. Okay. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas we had strong performance in Q4 sales, with the commercial team driving 27% year-on-year growth. Our team achieved phenomenal flow gen related growth of over 50% for the quarter. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing success of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 platforms, and it was powered by our Healthcare Informatics solutions, including AirView, U-Sleep, and myAir. We also saw ongoing customer adoption as we continue to expand our Life Support Ventilation business in the Americas with the Astral platform. We achieved good mask growth in the quarter with our AirFit portfolio, and it's important to note that pricing in this mask category is in a good place. We continue to expect solid Mask and Accessories category growth over the next year. Moving on to our combined European and Asia Pac region, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe, again driven by the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10 and the Astral platforms as well as robust growth in our Masks and our Accessories businesses. The big news for the Asia Pac group this quarter is our investment in the expansion of our China business. I'll talk more about the Curative Medical acquisition in a few moments. Let me now roll up to a broader perspective to discuss the progress we have made against our long-term growth plans, our three horizons of growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which encompasses our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive Healthcare Informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes. Our recent acquisition of CareTouch allows us to add key features to our resupply offerings. CareTouch is a provider of Internet-based solutions and resupply programs for the home care industry. This technology provides an easy use solution for managing patient populations with patient engagement algorithms and an automated IVR outreach as well as a live, multilingual call center. We have rebranded this offering as ResMed Resupply. We will continue to serve current CareTouch customers and expand this offering so that it's available to all our HME partners. As you heard at our Investor Day in San Francisco a few months ago from Raj Sodhi, the President of our Healthcare Informatics business, we now have established Healthcare Informatics as a core competence for ResMed. We will continue to build HI capabilities and buy them when appropriate so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings and ultimately improve patient outcomes. We also continue our ongoing efforts to build market awareness regarding the importance of sleep and sleep apnea during the quarter. We announced in the press release results from a study on our consumer wellness offering, the S+ by ResMed. The study showed that after one week of use 67% of S+ users with low baseline sleep scores achieved an improvement of an average 30 minutes of extra sleep per night. We are excited that our first consumer sleep wellness offer has achieved these results. The more consumers become aware of the importance of sleep and aware of any risky breathing or suffocation they have during the night, the better for addressing the vast majority of sleep apnea sufferers who are still not aware of their condition and have not yet seen a doctor about their problem. During the quarter we also announced a $5 million donation for medical research into sleep apnea and COPD to help create a Center for Excellence in this field at the University of California, San Diego. UCSD is a leading academic research institution located just a few miles from our global headquarters here in California. We believe that academic industry partnerships like this are critical to the ongoing innovation in the fields of both sleep and respiratory medicine. Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we are making solid progress on two fronts: list of free care market development, and ongoing investment in our high growth markets. We continue to grow our European Respiratory Care business from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade, since our acquisition of Saime in Europe in 2005. Our Americas region is fast following suit, fueled primarily by the Astral product offering. There is a very long global runway ahead for our life support, ventilation and our non-invasive ventilation solutions to help both COPD as well as neuromuscular disease patients. The Curative Medical acquisition that we announced earlier today hits on our strategy and horizon to both vectors. It grows our respiratory care product portfolio by adding current and existing and future ventilation products, and it also takes us to a leadership position in the geography in the high growth respiratory medical device market in China. Curative provides a complementary product portfolio for ResMed in both sleep apnea and respiratory care. ResMed and Curative offerings serve different customer segments through complementary channels. Together we have the broadest portfolio of innovative sleep apnea and ventilation devices, from premium imported devices to locally designed and manufactured product offerings that are tailored for the needs of the China market. We plan to continue to invest in both R&D and manufacturing in China for the Curative brand. We will maintain separate brands and distribution channels in order to quickly respond to the needs of the full spectrum of customer segments in China. Our Curative acquisition is an example of us putting our capital to work. We will continue to invest in China, India, Brazil, Eastern Europe and other key, high growth markets in medical devices. We will execute on long-term strategies that are tailored to each individual country while improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs. Our third horizon of growth includes a spectrum of cardio-respiratory conditions. We expect presentation of the SERVE-HF results by the study's primary investigators in a few months. Without going into too much detail on SERVE-HF, I would like to say that I am very proud of the global ResMed team and how we dealt with the SERVE-HF study. Our ethics and integrity was on full show. We made patient safety the most important priority. I believe that we have built credibility with patients, providers, cardiologists and our core sleep pulmonary and critical care physicians. That only adds to the ResMed brand. Subsequent quotes and discussions with key opinion leaders, both publicly and privately, have provided strength for this belief. We follow the data and we do the right thing. To this point you will see in the published results some interesting insights. For example, as discussed by our Chief Medical Officer at the APSS Conference in Seattle just a few months ago, as ejection fraction increases, there is an increasing trend towards benefit from ventilation therapy even amongst the third HF group. We will continue to monitor our heart failure patients in our U.S. based heart failure trial, which is called CAT-HF. Longer-term we see further adjacent opportunities in cardiology in heart failure but also in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. I'll provide more regarding our ongoing cardiovascular strategy during our next quarterly call. We remain active on the capital management front. This quarter, our board has declared an increase of our dividend by 7% to $0.30 per share. And we are continuing with our share purchase program. You will hear more from Brett in just a few moments. On the M&A front, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities that meet these three criteria: first, the business is aligned with our long-term growth strategy; second, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and third, that there is a cultural fit between the leader of the business and ResMed in our innovation culture. We found two great companies that meet all three of these criteria recently; CareTouch and Curative Medical. We will continue to seek further opportunities as appropriate. Let me close with this. We remain excited about our performance, our near-term outlook and our long-term three horizons growth strategy. We are the global leaders in sleep and respiratory medicine not just in market share, but more importantly, in product, service, channel and market innovation. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly, for our patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q4 and full-year financials. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: All right. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $453.1 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weak euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $32.5 million in the fourth quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $273.7 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia Pacific totaled $179.4 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking up revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $151.5 million, an increase of 53% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe and Asia Pacific, flow generator sales were $121.1 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Revenue growth in Europe and Asia Pacific was lower mostly due to lower ASP sales and a tough prior year comparable for Asia Pacific, reflecting typical lumpy order cycles. Masks and other sales were $58.3 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 25% while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, we incurred a one-time charge of $5 million associated with a field safety notice expenses in the response to the result of the SERVE-HF clinical trial. Additionally, we made donations totaling $6 million, which comprised of $5 million dollar donation to the University of California, San Diego, and a one-off incremental donation of $1 million to the ResMed Foundation. All of these charges have been excluded in non-GAAP numbers. In addition, the non-GAAP measures exclude amortization of acquired intangibles in the current year and restructuring expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles in the prior-year quarter. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers is included in our fourth quarter earnings press release. My subsequent commentary will reference non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP gross margins for the June quarter was 68.4%, lower than guidance, essentially due to product and geographic mix, notably the strong performance in America's flow generator style and the impact of lower ASP sales as a result of the SERVE-HF trial outcome. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 450 basis points, reflecting adverse currency movements, unfavorable geographic mix, unfavorable product mix and declines in average selling prices. Looking forward in fiscal year 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60% assuming current exchange rates. Now I'd like to spend a little time just walking through the drivers of our gross margin guidance. We are assuming that average selling prices remain relatively stable with a normal level of modest decline as we recycle the price change we made in the first half of fiscal year 2014. Our range does assume that we continue to have relative out-performance in America's flow-generated growth, which is positive to the top line but will have a negative price and geographic mix impact on our gross margin in fiscal year 2016. It also factors in the product mix impact associated with the expected reduction in ASV revenue. To the extent we continue to see out-performance in the America's flow generator growth, we would expect to move towards the lower end of our guidance range. However, as I said at our recent Investor Day, we're working very hard on our cost-out programs which include the benefit of shifting from air freight to sea freight as well as a pipeline of cost-out initiatives in the areas of procurement, production and logistics. The benefit to these programs will be realized over the course of fiscal year 2016 and will have a positive impact on our gross margin. Finally in terms of currency impacts on gross margin, the recent depreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind in Q1, however there will be a positive benefit from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which will be reflected in our gross margin from the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $123.5 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 12%, primarily due to higher available employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.2% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter; or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, Informatics Solutions, and clinical trials, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.1 million. On a non-GAAP basis our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.8%, and for the full fiscal year 2015 our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.5%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $96.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $87.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro and partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 11% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $99.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $17.7 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, representing an increase of 7% over the previous quarterly dividend. Additionally during the quarter, we repurchased 941,000 shares for consideration of 55.9 million. And for fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for consideration of 152.6 million. At the end of June, we had approximately 15.5 million shares remaining under our authorized repurchase program. In addition as Mick outlined, we announced the acquisition of Curative Medical and expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar year 2015. We've not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction. In fiscal year 2015, we've returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we've returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $417 million, and at June 30, title assets put up $2.2 billion, and net equity was $1.6 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Kelly, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: Thank you, we will not begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Your line is open.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much for taking my call. Terrific results. Could I perhaps just ask the effect or just to characterize the effect of ASP from the safety recall just with a – we saw already trend lines I guess particularly around people with a normal heart function who might have complex sleep apnea.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Andrew, for the call. And I agree with you, it was a good quarter. With regard to SERVE-HF and the follow-up from that, the results these last months since we published the SERVE-HF results all had been presented by our Chief Medical Officer at the conferences and discussed them with regulators, the publication will be in a couple months, have been pretty much in line with the information that we put out there. And so we said that ASP accounts for around 7% of our revenues and about a quarter of that is potentially in this affected population. So we're talking about impact of less than 1.75% of our group sales. And that's sort of the trend line that we've seen approximately in that range over the last months since the data were published on the trial. Interestingly, our ASP business in narcotic-induced central sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea has not been affected, and that's mostly in the U.S. side of the business and it's an opportunity for us to grow that what they sometimes call complex sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea opportunity in Europe.
Andrew Goodsall: And with the – I know you described Europe as having some impact for ASP. Would there be any reason why Europe is perhaps a little bit more difficult post the safety notice in Europe than perhaps the U.S.?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, thanks for the follow-up, Andrew. And yes, since we had run the SERVE-HF trial predominantly in Europe, there were some sites in Asia Pac, but mostly in Europe, and had been a big focus on the heart failure component that the majority of the ASP effect has been within the European region.
Andrew Goodsall: Perfect. And [indiscernible] just really quick housekeeping, just the FX effect of the net income level from Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, on the FX impact on EPS this quarter, it was pretty significant. It was around $0.05 negative on EPS.
Andrew Goodsall: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Again, your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor. Your line is open.
Michael Farrell: Matt, I think you've either got us on mute or you're not there. Let's go to the next question, Kelly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your line is open.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two areas for us; Mick, talk a little bit about the durability of the reacceleration in Masks? You had an easy comp obviously in the quarter, but you're getting rid of the price declines. Do you see Masks in the U.S., and you talked a little bit to this in your script, but do you see it getting back to the high-single-digit growth rate durably?
Michael Farrell: So good question, Andrew, and yeah it was a great turnaround from Q3 to Q4, from minus 3% to plus 5% on the Masks line. We do think that's a sustainable turnaround for a number of reasons. The AirFit portfolio, particularly the P10 and the F10, are very solid and strong masks and are being received really well by customers. That's point one. And point two is yeah, we annualized those price declines that we talked about from January to June, 2014 through January to June, 2015 so we're through that sort of hurdle. So good products, good pricing, good positioning and we think the masks will continue to do well for the year ahead.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then on the gross margin side, Brett, maybe give us some insights into the relative magnitude of currency, mix, geography, things like that? So whether for Q4 or maybe for 2016 so we can be a little more granular in how we think about that? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, Ben. If you look at Q4 year-on-year, and as you know a bunch of drivers on that margin, but if you look at that, the single biggest impact for us was FX. And to put that into perspective, I think it was around sort of that 150 basis point mark. So that was the biggest impact, but each of the others were meaningful in terms of geographic mix, product mix and ASP decline I think all played a part in that. That kind of gives you sort of a relative sense of what was driving the gross margin there.
Ben Andrew: And then the guidance again for 2016, is it presumably product mix is a bigger impact? Or is it some of the other things start to go the other way? Is that fair?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I think that – yeah. I mean the mix, with the flow generator growth in the U.S., what you're seeing there is quite extraordinary. So it does swing your product mix and your geographic mix somewhat. So they sort of become a little more volatile, if you like. So I think if you were – I think it will run through fiscal year 2016, I think some of those will tend to moderate as kind of your cycle price introduction and so on. As you know we're working very hard on cost-out programs, and they will deliver. The timing will be uncertain but they'll deliver over the course of 2016. And then currencies, okay, that's always a bit of a wild card, but we've seen some depreciation in the Aussie dollar recently. We haven't seen the benefit of that yet, tends to lag about a quarter. Really we'll start to see some of that benefiting in Q2 as well. So I mean some of the – certainly a lot of those drivers that were working against us will certainly I think moderate over the course of 2016. But again, they're quite volatile so the kind of the gross margins guidance would be a little bit wider, I think that really accounts for some of the volatility we're seeing in some of the drivers.
Ben Andrew: Okay.
Michael Farrell: Ben, I'd just add to that, to Brett's comments which I agree with all of them, and I don't want to sound like a broken record but I'll reiterate what we're doing the next 12 months on this, we're moving from air freight to sea freight as these products ramp up. We're moving these cost-out programs in the supply chain, so that's with suppliers and our partners but also within our internal programs and manufacturing and COGS reduction. And thirdly, we're increasing the incremental growth at lower cost plants. And I think all those three elements will help move GM to the higher end of Brett's guidance rather than the low one. And then finally, our sales teams, Jim and Ann and their teams are being provided incentives to drive high gross margin growth. So growth in the AirCurve 10 range, growth in the Astral range, and growth in the AirFit range of masks all being provided incentives to the channel to make sure that we grow those high GMx products. And so all those together I think are a pretty powerful weapon.
Ben Andrew: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Anthony Petrone: Great. Thanks. Maybe just to focus in on SERVE-HF and just cardiology, I'm wondering, Mick, maybe if you can resize the opportunity post the SERVE-HF results here, it seems there's still certainly an opportunity in the less sick patient population. I'm just wondering if there's any numbers that you can share with us around that? The follow-up to that would be is there an update on timing in getting to that patient population? And then lastly on this topic, which could be an update on CAT-HF? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. So to seize the opportunity in HF globally, we're in the U.S. with more than 8 million patients and globally there are more than 20 million patients with heart failure worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea progress in that group is north of 40%, we think central sleep apnea is around 30%. SERVE-HF was targeted at the 30%. If you look at all the key opinion leaders post SERVE-HF and their comments around both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea in general, is obstructive sleep apnea should be treated with all co-morbidities, and the SERVE-HF results have no impact on that area. I might go into some information in some publications that have come out from ATS in the American Journal for Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, on that front if we need to, but certainly that's what the key opinion leaders are saying. That's what we've seen in practice as we look at our sales over the last sort of 60, 90 days since the SERVE-HF results have come out. So as we look forward we think there's still a significant opportunity in heart failure with the obstructive sleep apnea patients. And amongst the central sleep apnea patients, which is the 30% prevalent side, physicians are still trying to work out what to do, whether it's just CPAP or a combination of oxygen and CPAP or bi-level, and they're working through each of those modalities. And I think you'll see a lot of research in the area to go closer to HF to next steps. We are working with Chris O'Connor and the group at CAT-HF to certainly finish and follow through on the patients who are already in that trial. And Rob and I just had a teleconference with Chis O'Connor a couple of days ago, and we're planning for next steps post HF and post CAT-HF, how do we find the groups of patients who are well treated and we can really focus on health economics, keeping patients out of hospital beyond that 30-day, 90-day period with heart failure, which is such a focus, and their functional outcomes as steps that we look ahead for post CAT-HF and post SERVE-HF. And as I said in the preliminary remarks, we're in the field of play here. We'll give you an update next quarter as to where we are with our cardiovascular strategy, but we're not moving away from this area. In fact, we're likely to double down on it because as you'll see, the results from SERVE-HF come out with some pretty interesting insights as you look at the different quintiles and the different groups of patients. But I'm not going to say too much more on that because I'm going to wait for the data to be published in the period review article, and then I can start to talk about the market opportunities that have part of that. Thanks for the question, Anthony.
Anthony Petrone: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Steve Wheen: Good morning. Just a quick question on the margin again; you mentioned the various factors, Brett, that were impacting it. One of them is the ASP, the ongoing ASP declines. You're obviously seeing a rebasing of pricing in masks now that it's returned to growth, so is there, can you just sort of talk to the think pressure you're seeing across the flow generators, which I assume is where that is coming from?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I mean, the ASP declines was year-on-year, Steve, so still cycling a little bit of that kind of second half impact, but we're basically through that now. So we do think the impacts from ASP declines will certainly moderate from where they've been. And that's kind of being factored into the guidance. As Mick said, we're seeing a relatively stable environment, I guess, on the pricing at the moment, and that's kind of across the whole product range really.
Steve Wheen: Okay. And then, some commentary that you made last quarter was that you'd be expecting to be not as reliant on air freighting. Did that not pan out as you expected just because of the sheer uptick in volume that you saw in flow generators? Are we still seeing that sort of impact on the gross margin from air freight?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, true. We haven't been able to get, basically move from air freight to sea freight quite as quickly as we would have liked. And you saw it just in the latest quarter. When you look at it, frankly the flow gen growth has been accelerating through the quarters. This quarter you saw 50% growth in the U.S., which is quite phenomenal. But the guys have really done a great job in making sure we've got the capacity there and that product is going out to market quite seamlessly. But we've been doing that with obviously more air freight than we would like. Based on the trend down it was kind of where we're looking at July that I'm quite happy with how we're trending that now. But I do think that will start to see meaningful benefit I think coming through in Q2 on the freight out program. The trajectory and the trend is absolutely there, so I'm quite confident we'll see that; likely to be Q2 impact at this stage.
Steve Wheen: Yeah. And just to be clear, that air freight cost is sitting in your gross margin, not in your SG&A line? And if you can just cover off on whether or not because of that demand in flow generators you've got any unfilled orders?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, so definitely it's in our gross margin, the freight. The – and we don't, no, we would have finished the quarter pretty much with negligible back orders.
Steve Wheen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior from Evans & Partners. Your line is open.
Matthew Prior: All right, guys. Great results. Just two questions; first one from me is Mick, just in terms of the U.S. sales and the great flow gen result, where are we in terms of the Astral product cycle and ramp-up given that – I'm just wondering with the strong U.S. flow gen result and the uptake of Informatics if we're focused a little bit too much on the sleep side of the business? And you may be having success in ventilation in Astral in the U.S. that's somewhat covered up I guess in the focus on that number.
Michael Farrell: Well, Matthew, the U.S. flow generators numbers includes both sleep and respiratory care products, but the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 are the vast majority of it. But I'll hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to maybe give a little more color on the growth of our Astral line of respiratory care and the flow generator, the amazing growth in the line's growth for the quarter.
James Hollingshead: Yeah, we've had great flow generator growth across the entire quarter. Specifically your question on Astral, it's still early days on Astral. And so that's still ramping, but it's so far, exceeding our expectations. The device is quite a good device. It's very strong clinically and it has very high ease of use. And so we're very happy, we're very pleased with the adoption of Astral. It's ahead of expectations.
Matthew Prior: All right. Thanks. And just a second question from me. Mick, in terms of Informatics, can you talk whether the Informatics roll-out and uptake has driven any mask resupply styles increase in terms of that important metric, and whether that aided you in the fourth quarter with U.S. mask sales? And also just ask are you seeing any re-tapping on the back of Informatics' success? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: Good questions, Matt. The Healthcare Informatics core competency, the capability their view, U-Sleep and myAir has really enabled us to achieve those flow generator growth numbers. The analogy would be iTunes is such a great platform that people are buying a lot of iPhones and iPads, and so we do think that the growth of those flow generators is linked to really the changing of the basis of competition in our industry from just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And that more connected element is the Informatics that liberates the data, unlocks values for patients, providers and physicians and, ultimately, hospital systems. Your question, your sort of part two of the question was is there a link to the Q4 masks number? And I'd say, no, no, just yes, right? The acquisition of Jaysec earlier this fiscal year and CareTouch that we announced just earlier this month, both will enable us to use those data to drive resupply programs and to get them out to all the HMEs and make available to all the HMEs. We think there's still a huge opportunity to contact patients and let them know how far up they are along in their mask gauging and give them an opportunity to buy. So I think as you look forward over FY 2016 and beyond, there's a huge opportunity for Informatics to drive mask sales, but it wasn't really there in Q4. And the re-tapping opportunity again, I'd say that's not in the historic, that's in the future. And we do have an opportunity to reach out to patients through the Informatics solution, to e-mail, text or IVR to patients on coaching and adherence, and that could lead to reaching out our masks and on re-tapping. So you'll hear more from us over the coming fiscal year, and we can give you an update next quarter as to the link between Informatics and driving those trialing revenues. But it's a huge opportunity for us and for our channel and for the patients.
Matthew Prior: All right. Thanks, guys.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Du from CBA. Your line is open.
Bruce Du: Hi, guys. I just firstly was following up on the ASV question prior. You touched on sort of the impact in Europe, so I was sort of just wondering whether or not you've seen or probably expect to see the next couple of quarters any impact in terms of demand out of Asia. And I know you sort of mentioned that Japan in the past has been quite a lumpy market, but this thing could take up there?
Michael Farrell: Yeah, Bruce. Well, I'll hand it to Rob Douglas to talk about the impacts on ASV in Asia Pac. Rob, do you want to take that?
Robert Douglas: Yeah, definitely. We've talked quite a lot that the ASV's been very successful, and there have been a lot of local trials in Japan. In various patient populations, there's an incredible amount of support for the ASV in Japan. Given the different regulator environments in that, the Japanese regulators are moving at a very deliberate pace towards analyzing and understanding what this has been and what it all means, but we expect there still to be significant interest in Japan. And in the short-term Japan remains, still because of the nature of the market, we have variable demand on a quarter-to-quarter basis for Japan. So it's a little bit hard to measure that exactly at this stage.
Michael Farrell: The only thing I'd add to Rob's comments, which I agree with them, is that in Japan ASV is often used in an acute setting.
Robert Douglas: Yeah.
Michael Farrell: The SERVE-HF results were done in a chronic setting, and so the physicians there are working through the difference of application between acute and chronic care, and there are different clinical implications. And more will come out post the publication of the SERVE-HF data on that in the coming months. Thanks for the question, Bruce.
Bruce Du: Okay. Great. And I just had one more, it was just around clarifying is it correct that the non-invasive ventilation is now out of competitive bidding, the upcoming round?
Michael Farrell: I'll hand to Dave Pendarvis to answer that.
David Pendarvis: Yup. Short answer is yes, Bruce, that the next rounds of competitive bidding will not include non-invasive ventilation. There was an initial proposal that it would, and the announcement after that, that it's not included in competitive bidding, which our customers feel good about and we feel good about.
Bruce Du: Okay. Excellent. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Matthew O’Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to start with the – a follow-up to a previous question on the Informatics. Mick, just as you think about where that product line can go going forward, I think we're probably low-single-digits in terms of market share at this point, but just how that market's going to segment itself over the next several years between the real high end featured products including Informatics versus kind of your average mid-to-low feature set and then the low end as well?
Michael Farrell: Yeah, Matthew. The impact on revenue of the Informatics is really through the rest of the business. So if you think of Informatics really as an enabler or a new basis of enabling our HME providers, our patients and our physicians to get access to data. So physicians can access data in AirView, patients can access it in myAir, and then through electronic data interchange we're able to put the data into Epic or Cerner systems for hospitals and even payer providers so they can leverage that data. So the monetary, you're talking about what percentage of the revenue, the monetary feedback directly from payments for the Informatics Solutions is de minimis and it's not material. But the enabling of the sales, such as the 53% growth in flow generators in the quarter in the Americas, was really fueled and catalyzed and powered by those Healthcare Informatics solutions. So we do have internal calculations of the value of Informatics to justify our ongoing investment in that space, but it's a really long-term play about showing the value of home care, of taking sick patients out of hospital, putting them in a home and saving money for broken healthcare systems that's there.
Matthew O’Brien: Sorry, Mick, I think I wasn't real clear on the question. It wasn't a function of what kind of revenue can you get from the Informatics. It was more of a function of if you don't offer Informatics on your CPAP system, are you just not going to be able to participate in the segment of the market, and will that segment of the market be 25%, 30% of all CPAPs being sold in a few years.
Michael Farrell: That's a good question. Thanks for the clarification, Matthew. Look, I think that it'll first be 100% of the market that you require data because what's happening is what we're doing is if you look at the data that's in our investor deck there, the published data that we put out there on the product called U-Sleep, where we showed a 59% reduction in the labor costs for the HME upon using U-Sleep and an increase in adherence from 73% to 83%. You start to run the economics for our customer, and it's going to become just an essential basis of competition to play. But I want to make it clear that Informatics is not Informatics. It's not just saying, well I can get my data to the cloud. It's doing it fast, securely, enabling systems to move quickly, and I do think there's a partnership element of connecting directly into the Epic or Cerner system or into our HME-provider systems on the electronic front. And it's a global play. It goes beyond just the first four ways, really just been in the U.S. in the Americas region, but we are now moving our Informatics capabilities into France, Germany, Japan, and it's really something that is going to go global. So I think it quickly goes from where it is now to 100% over the coming quarters and fiscal year.
Matthew O’Brien: Okay. And then as the follow-up, the Curative transaction that you just announced. I know that you didn't want to provide too much in the way of details, but could you just give us a sense for how quickly that business is growing and the profitability profile versus overall resonating?
Michael Farrell: So we're not going to get into specific details on it because it's not material to our global business. It's on the order of 1% of our group revenues. It's growing faster than our group, and we're very excited about the opportunity. It takes us to a leadership position within the China market and sleep and respiratory medicine. And Jason Sun, the founder and CEO, is a great gentlemen, an individual, a very smart leader and entrepreneur who's created a very strong team around him in Suzhou. And we're really excited to be partnering with Curative to help grow and help the Chinese population get access to great care across the customer segments from Curative and ResMed.
Matthew O’Brien: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Taylor: Hi. Apologies for before, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask one about masks. In the beginning of your prepared comments, you said that you were excited about mask growth next year, you expected robust growth. And I was wondering if you could just help us qualitatively understand what's driving that? If it's pull-through or launches or both, or just continued strength of the product?
Michael Farrell: Yeah, Matt, I'm excited about the mask growth. People close to the business are even more excited about it. I'm going to hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to talk about it.
James Hollingshead: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We've talked over the last two or three quarters about how we changed our pricing strategy and now that that's been grandfathered I think the biggest move that happened this quarter is a lot of those pricing moves that we made in mask in the second half of the prior year of neg ramp [ph] following through. So we've seen pricing stabilize. The AirFit range of masks continues to compete very, very strongly, I would say especially in pillows and full face. The nasal market has always been the most competitive category of masks and continues to be quite competitive. But our volumes are up and our pricing is stabilizing. We have a very strong position and we feel confident we can maintain growth.
Matthew Taylor: Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on flow gens, just given how strong the Americas growth has been, once you start comping those big numbers, how much more can you grow over those 53%, 42% growth numbers that you had in the back half?
Michael Farrell: Yeah, Matt, if you look at our global sleep and respiratory market, we believe it's growing in the sort of mid-single digits. So you can't grow double-digits forever, but our goal is to not just meet but we want to beat market growth in every geography we're in every financial period we're there. So we're searching for excellence. The team has produced excellence, and we're going to continue to do what we can to outperform market growth.
Matthew Taylor: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Ian Abbott: Oh, yes. Good afternoon. I was just wondering on the informatics where you're at in the roll-out of that to DMEs in the U.S.? Do you think you've pretty much reached all of them with your latest informatics, or do you still get some way to go there?
Michael Farrell: Jim?
James Hollingshead: It's a great question, Ian. Thanks. The – where we've seen everybody with the initial offering, right? So the uptake of the initial offering has been very, very strong. And I think that that's a huge contributor to the flow gen growth. We're taking share in flow gen and I think we're taking share in flow gen. And a large part of the devices is great the device, both the AirSense and AirCurve devices are fantastic devices, just an aside [ph] , but the Informatics side of that with anybody comms and the Software-as-a-Service platform is clearly starting to get uptake because it creates a lot of value for our customers. And what they're seeing is both they can increase compliance and therefore increase revenue, but they also take out a lot of labor-intensive processes with it and troubleshooting and patient management some. So broadly it's getting adopted. We will add to the platform. So you see things like the Jaysec acquisition and the CareTouch acquisition. As we build on the platform our customers will get even more growth. And so as we build the platform we hope to drive even more adoption, which should maintain an even grow share in the flow gen space, make our customers' businesses more productive, more profitable, and improve the health of the market for both us and for our customers.
Ian Abbott: So would mastery [ph] be on some version of it already? I mean I know you're saying you're rolling out more, but do you feel like you're fairly well there already?
James Hollingshead: I think there's a lot of growth to come. I mean I think that the platform will grow and so we'll have more feature sets and more opportunities for growth as the platform grows, but we've had very broad adoption of the product set across the whole market of HMEs, right. It's not restricted to a customer set. We're getting broad adoption across all of our customers. We're getting growing adoption across our customers. And we will continue to drive that as we add more features to the platform.
Michael Farrell: And Ian, I'd add that beyond the U.S. geography which sort of has been the first early adopter here if you like of the Healthcare Informatics solutions, and that study I referenced was based in the U.S., we're seeing the same thing as we take this offering to France, to Germany, to Japan, across Northern Europe and we will be taking this globally to all of the 100 countries that we provide products in. And the value that's provided in this is universal. I mean we take waste and inefficiency out of the delivery system. We provide data real-time, we call it the HALO, Hour After Last Off. You literally can put your mask down at 6:30 a.m., by 7:30 a.m. your data are in the cloud and they're available for you on your smartphone on myAir. There available for the doctor at your 7:30 appointment. And they've available to the portfolio manager who's looking at a population of chronic disease, of COPD, sleep apnea or heart failure or hypertension patients. And so the value of that has such a low runway that Jim saying it's available to every customer in the U.S. is 100% true, but has it fully unlocked all its value in the U.S.? No way. And has it gone to every country around the world that we do business in? And have we been able to show that value fully yet? No way. There's a whole lot of runway left on that.
Ian Abbott: Okay. Thank you. And my other question was about SERVE-HF; it's now a couple of months since you actually came out with the trial, initial trial data. How would you characterize the response from the sleep doctors from that, and the cardiologists? How would you sort of in general characterize the response, and what sort of things are they looking for going forward?
Michael Farrell: So on this one, I won't characterize a response. I'll read out the response from the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which is the journal of the American Thoracic Society. Let's read two paragraphs out. This is four authors from University of British Colombia, Johns Hopkins, Brown and others. The title of the paragraph is What Should we do with Patients Being Treated with ASV for Other Indications? And I'll just quote this. "It is important to note that survey chest study only included patients with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central events, and the findings should not be extrapolated beyond the study population. Patients who have been given ASV for other indications, such as narcotic injuries, central sleep apnea, heart failure, preserved ejection fraction or complex sleep apnea, can likely continue ASV safely as we see no compelling reason to withdraw, especially if there is a beneficial impact on their symptoms." And they go on further to say, "We believe that newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea should be treated on CPAP as a first-line treatment of obstructive sleep apnea if clinically indicated as there is no compelling reason to believe that CPAP is harmful in any way with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction patients." So they're just two quotes directly from publication in mid-July from APS. What we've seen out in the market is exactly that. The sleep physicians and the cardiologists are working together to look for patient groups where they can double-down on treatment with, I would say, bi-level, oxygen and ASV, and they're looking for areas where there might a safety signal, but as we delve further and further into the SERVE-HF data, our chief medical officer said at a session at APSS that when you get ejection fraction above 30%, the safety signal goes away. So these data are going to get out there. There's going to be public, and there's going to be a lot of follow on, but the dust has sort of settled on these last two months, and it's sort of what we predicted, as I said earlier, in the numbers, and as adjusted earlier, they're from the peer-reviewed press that we're starting to see articles concerning that and certainly in the numbers we're seeing in sales and the channel. We're seeing that we're all moving forward, and a great thing about this is that we've done some great scientific research. We have the data on Kern-Loin [ph] showing a 60% reduction in mortality in severe COPD, and we had a safety signal in heart failure. But our reputation at ResMed in our clinical community only goes up by these large, randomized controlled trials that we publish in the peer-reviewed press and will continue to do that.
Ian Abbott: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Low: Thanks very much. I think most of the questions have been asked, but just a couple of ones. Competitive bidding, which is a national roll-out next calendar year, what are your expectations or the implications of that?
Michael Farrell: Dave?
David Pendarvis: So it's still a little bit up in the air, but the announcement is that you've got a January 1 phase-in that goes sort of half and half with existing rights and half with the national averages, or national averages plus 110% depending upon whether you're in an MSA or not. And then July 1 going forward would be the new rights set on either the national or local averages. But we obviously support our customers. We think our customers ought to be getting fair value for the services that they are providing. And I know there is still dialogue that is going on. So it remains to be seen whether or not this goes forward on the date as scheduled but regardless we think that this competitive bidding that's been in round one and in round two is a known quantity. So from a disruption standpoint there should be less, there's a little bit easier to plan for. And also because there's no reduction in the number of providers while on the one hand you'd say for our customers it's not quite as fair because they're just taking the price cuts without getting the volume up. On the other hand, there's less disruption in terms of who's going to be in the market as a customer. So we'll wait and see when it comes out and how it progresses. But we feel reasonably confident about how the market is going to develop between here and there.
David Low: Okay, thanks. And just switching to the acquisition that's been announced today, Curative. Am I right in understanding that effectively you'll have two product ranges in China? And is that a strategy that you'd expect to take to other markets?
Michael Farrell: Sir Rob Douglas will answer this.
Robert Douglas: Yeah, thanks, David. So we think the Curative brand is actually quite strong in China. It's one of the major players there. And the interesting thing behind the acquisition rational, there's a very strong correlation in culture and values in those brands values. And also as we think about China in terms of segmentation in the market where there are people who want to buy our stuff, expensive stuff and people who want good stuff, local. And so we – and our distribution channels are actually quite complementary through that. So specifically in China we see that multi-brand strategy working well and we talk with our teams, we will have coordinated strategies, but we'll be very independent entities. And we think that's a very efficient way to run an integration plan. As we look at other markets they'll be done on a market-by-market basis as to what makes sense in those as we move across the world.
David Low: So is security offer cheaper presumably then a ResMed or a Respironics offer?
Michael Farrell: You know what? I don't think we'd go there. It's more a question of functioning, good functioning, good value products, our target into the right segments. And really these products have all been designed in China for the China market. So they really got the right picture fit for those patients that have targeted that.
David Low: Okay. Great. Well, thanks very much.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Securities. Your line is open.
Joanne Wuensch: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I have a very specific one and a very big picture one. First one specific, what's really interesting to me is that year-over-year your gross margins declined by 450 basis points, but operating margins are only down 90 basis points which means you're managing the rest of your expenses. How do I think about the FX impact that rolls through the other expenses that helped you capture that only 90 basis point hit?
Michael Farrell: Brett, do you want to have the first go at that and maybe Rob add some color?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. I mean Joanne, you're right, I mean we do take more of a holistic approach to it and sort of the products and for example the flow gen growth's been great on top line, been some pressure on the gross margin but we also managed the operating expenses as well. So at an operating profit level, and you can look at it on a non-GAAP basis, operating profits grew 5% notwithstanding a bunch of FX headwinds and distractions from SERVE-HF and so on. So this thing kind of demonstrates pretty resilient, pretty robust business I think. And so we try to manage it across the board, not just kind of one particular segment. So but the currency, so I mean certainly it helps us if you like the currencies through the SG&A and R&D, helps us a bit on the gross margin. I think if you step back, take a longer term, I think we're still very committed to getting operating leverage at kind of that SG&A or operating profit level, so I think, think of it in that context, that we do want to get operating leverage there. To the extent we get that, that's certainly going to drop to the bottom line and help our earnings per share.
Joanne Wuensch: That's helpful. So it implies that, that is the right way to think about this holistically, that there's a lot of pieces running through this and that there's room over time...
Brett Sandercock: Exactly.
Joanne Wuensch: Okay.
Brett Sandercock: Exactly.
Joanne Wuensch: Thank you. Now for the big picture question, most of my medtech companies at this stage are consolidating. We're running a lot of merger models on a regular basis. You guys have done an amazing job since the spin-out from Baxter, you're making tuck-in acquisitions like we saw today in China. How do you think about playing the new world order where more product is better product?
Michael Farrell: Well, Joanne, you know we play in a different space to companies like the big ones you're talking about like Medtronic, Covidien, Label [ph] . You're selling products to hospitals and large GPOs [ph] . Our job, and at some of the lines with the Western European healthcare systems and where the U.S. healthcare system has now gone with Accountable Care organizations, that the goal now is to keep patients out of hospital and in the home. And within the homecare medical device space we have a very strong position, and certainly within the respiratory medical and COPD side we're the market leader in driving those channels. So I would say our opportunity is to continue to drive value to show that taking patients out of hospital and putting them into the home is the right thing. And our job is to run faster and do better and to make sure that we continue to grow. We will continue to look at M&A, as we announced on this call two acquisitions, and our goal is organic growth and leveraging our current business, driving the operating leverage that you mentioned in the first part of your question, but also looking strategically at how we can add value to the marketplace, and I think taking patients out of the hospital, managing them in the home, getting the data to the cloud so you can quantify the benefit of that is kind of a unique value proposition, if you like, to the medical device market. Yeah, we have competition, and we continue to compete against our fellow competitors in the homecare space and the respiratory space. I think we do it better and I think we'll continue to lead and innovate and look at appropriate M&A to keep ourselves at the front of the pack.
Joanne Wuensch: Thank you.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Joanne.
Operator: And we are now at the one hour mark. I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for closing remarks.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Kelly. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives with every breath. We've had an incredible year launching game-changing products and services and we've reached $1.7 billion in annual revenues, but we remain laser focused on our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today.
Agnes Lee: Thank you again for joining us. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investors.resmed.com. Kelly, you may now close the call.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2015 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Adrienne. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Agnes and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we continued to make excellent progress from new product launches in our core sleep disorder breathing market. We also saw solid progress in our cardiology and respiratory care markets during the quarter. In these opening remarks, I'll discuss our high-level top and bottom line results, our progress in healthcare informatics and the early trajectory of our latest product and solution launches globally. Finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney, our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth of 13% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 6% on a year-on-year basis in U.S. dollars. We saw strength in our Americas group, with continued double-digit growth in the region, driven by robust sales growth in flow generators as well as high-single-digit constant currency growth in our combined European and Asia-Pacific region. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease states. Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.64 on a GAAP basis. In the Americas, we had strong performance in Q3 sales, with the commercial team there driving 16% year-on-year growth. We're particularly pleased with flow generator growth in the region which was over 40%. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing successful rollout of our Astral, our AirSense 10 and our AirCurve 10 platforms. Customers continue to see the value proposition of our healthcare informatics platform that we have branded Air Solutions. This platform continues to drive our flow generator success. The strong flow generator sales were partially offset by lower mask sales. On that front, we're still facing annualization of price adjustments that we made from January through to June in 2014. In addition, we're facing a tough competitive environment in the mask category. However, we're confident that we will return to positive growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward. Moving on to our combined European and Asia-Pacific region, we grew at a very solid 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. After we account for the strong currency headwinds, particularly from the declining euro and the strong U.S. dollar, headline growth declined by 6% for the combined Europe and Asia-Pacific region. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe associated with our new product launches as well as steady growth in masks in the region. With the latest launch of our AirCurve 10 bilevel flow generator platform in Europe, we continue to add to the broad suite of launches with solid multiyear product life cycles. There continues to be strong interest in respiratory care and cardiorespiratory opportunities across the European region. We have seen good adoption of our Astral platform in Europe and we're excited about future opportunities as we combine Astral with our healthcare informatics solutions. We continued to work with our European and Asia-Pac teams to develop treatment pathways that facilitate standard-of-care protocols, including both pulmonary and cardiology physician groups in both hospital and home care environments. As an important component of our SERVE-HF clinical trial, we're investing in cardiology awareness, cardiology screening and cardiology diagnostic referral infrastructure to the pulmonary folks in the European region and beyond. I will discuss SERVE HF in more detail later on in these remarks. In Asia-Pac, we're continuing to execute on our strategies for longer-term growth while working across a variety of mask and market delivery channels. In addition, we had strong double-digit growth in key emerging market countries, particularly China, as we continue to build for the future in those markets. Let me spend a few moments reviewing some of the background behind our progress in informatics. As outlined earlier, we call our healthcare informatics ecosystem Air Solutions. Air Solutions is providing significant quantifiable value to our customers, leading to discretionary share gains in flow generators sales. More importantly, Air Solutions use liberating data to help patients, physicians, providers, government and private payers and other partners in the healthcare delivery channel. We're seeing the results of our innovation, even though it is just over seven months since the launch of our first AirSense 10 product. Customers have recognized the value of Air Solutions, an end-to-end system that can help them one, lower costs; two, drive efficiencies; three, increase patient adherence; and four, improve patient care. During the quarter, we further enhanced the Air Solutions ecosystem through the integration of our AirView software with leading healthcare informatics partners. We also announced the acquisition of Jaysec. Jaysec is a provider of Internet-based software solutions for our home medical equipment customers. This acquisition allows us to deliver automated, streamlined business solutions, such as mask and accessory resupply systems, that are both cost effective and drive efficiencies for our HME partners. We're offering all Jaysec products to all customers. We see many opportunities to enhance and expand our informatics solution as the broader healthcare industry continues to move towards connected care models. We will use our newest core competence in healthcare informatics to drive channel efficiencies, to unlock cost savings and most importantly, to improve patient outcomes. Let me drill into the detail of our new product launches just a little. We launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December. And although it is still early days, we had good uptake and excellent customer feedback in this, our first full quarter of sales. We also launched the AirCurve 10 in Europe during Q3. This included an important new device, the AirCurve CS PaceWave. PaceWave is our brand name for our proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation therapy. The acronym for this algorithm is MVASV. But I think that PaceWave is easier to remember. Our PaceWave algorithm is unique and highly protected with patents and other intellectual property. As part of the AirCurve 10 launch, we added Air Solutions, our cloud-based software solutions technology, to our bilevel, our noninvasive ventilation and our adaptive servo-ventilation platforms. The combination of the AirCurve 10 CS PaceWave with our Air Solutions platform is particularly powerful, given the hospitalization rates and the severity of disease for patients who suffer from heart failure and concomitant sleep apnea. For our mask and accessories category, the market remains stable, but competitive. As I stated earlier, we're confident that we will return to solid growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward. Now I would like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our global three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive healthcare informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes. Our recent acquisition of Jaysec and completing our integration with leading informatics partners are good milestones in that journey. We're taking advantage of future opportunities to grow even more connected care solutions with customers through the AirCurve 10 launch. Reimbursement remains relatively stable across our geographies, including the U.S. Last week, our U.S. customers welcomed positive news as Obama signed the doc fix bill which added anti-fraud provisions to competitive bidding. This change requires binding bids and proof that a DME or HME is licensed in the state that it is providing products to customers. Although this legislation does not impact current bidding rounds, it will have a positive impact on future recompete rounds. The bottom line is that this should improve the quality of bidders to ensure that they deliver good service to patients and it should improve the stability of the channel. On the legal front, we won an injunction against a Chinese-based competitor in Germany during February. The Munich District Court upheld its injunction that prohibits the sale or distribution of that company's masks that infringe our patents. At ResMed, we're committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and we will defend our more than 5000 patents and designs so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions of lives as we move forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend our significant investment in research and development. Our global R&D investment is holding strong, at approximately 7% of our revenues, with a focus on pioneering clinical research, world-leading biomedical engineering and cutting-edge healthcare informatics. Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we're making solid progress on two fronts, our respiratory care market as well as our emerging markets growth. The European respiratory care business is growing from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade and more. In the U.S., we continue to build our respiratory care channels and our strength in those channels. There is a very long runway ahead for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients to be helped by our Astral life-support ventilator and our other offerings. The Astral platform allows patient care to take place in the home rather than in the hospital, providing better quality of life for patients, including caregivers and loved ones and simultaneously taking costs out of strained healthcare systems. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, with solid double-digit growth this quarter. We've increased our investment in these markets and are executing on our long term strategies in China, India, Brazil, as well as Eastern Europe., where there are great opportunities to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs across these emerging markets. Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration, particularly in heart failure patients. There is growing momentum in the heart failure and sleep apnea space and we continue to facilitate strong partnerships between cardiologists and critical care and pulmonary physicians. There have been a number of new studies this quarter that continue to build a connection between heart failure and SDB, including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. At the American College of Cardiology, or ACC, meeting here in San Diego, we sponsored two posters on sleep disordered breathing in patients with chronic heart failure. One of the posters with final data from nearly 7000 patients in Germany showed that 46% of patients with stable chronic heart failure had moderate to severe SDB, AHI north of 15. That's almost every second patient that walks in the cardiologists' door. The second poster from Thomas Jefferson University suggested that treating SDB in chronic heart failure patients may reduce hospital admission and hospital readmission rates. In addition, Ohio State University research has published a study in January showing that patients with untreated sleep apnea have worse prognosis for mortality after they have been discharged from the hospital for acute heart failure. The data suggests that those that had their sleep apnea treated with PAP therapy improved survival rates, approximately to rates that were similar to patients who had heart failure with minimal or no sleep apnea. This study supports the work that we're doing on our SERVE-HF and our CAT-HF clinical trials. Focusing now on those trials. Our SERVE-HF trial in Europe and Australia is going well. In fact, data collection has been occurring at a faster pace during these last three months. As a result, we're now expecting presentation of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators to occur before the end of calendar year 2015. This is slightly ahead of the timeline that we discussed on our Q2 call. For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we still expect that the CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered show improvements in global cardiovascular outcomes. Both trials lead to a potential change in guiding principles and standard-of-care for heart failure patients. It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation technology which the acronym again is MVASV, that we have branded PaceWave. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached in both of these important and pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You will hear more about these actions in Q3 from Brett in a couple of minutes. Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long term three horizon growth strategy and assets that we can leverage, manage better than the current owners and enhance long term shareholder value. Let me close with this. We're excited about our long term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We're progressing on our journey to change 20 million lives by 2020 in both sleep and broader respiratory medicine. We're executing well to that plan. With that, I will turn the care over to Brett in Sydney for a more detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thank you, Mick. As Mick has noted, our revenue for the March quarter was $422.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $28.5 million in the third quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $250.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.6 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segment, Americas' flow generators sales were $133.1 million, an increase of 42% over the prior-year quarter. While masks and other sales were $117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $115.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, an increase of 13%. Masks and other sales were $55.7 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 26%, while masks and other decreased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margins for the March quarter were 59.5%, lower than guidance essentially due to larger-than-expected depreciation of the euro during the quarter and outperformance on Americas flow generator growth. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 380 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices, unfavorable product mix, unfavorable geographic mix and adverse currency movements. Looking forward in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be broadly consistent with Q3, being in the range of 59% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. Gross margin drivers, like currency fluctuations and geographic and product mix could swing this range further if they move beyond their expectations. We do expect to see some traction in late Q4 from our cost-out programs for the AirSense platform and should see ongoing benefits from our cost-out programs, including procurement, production and logistics improvements reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $116.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%, primarily due to higher variable employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter. But on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase largely reflects incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority of our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.2 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will be in the range of 20% to 21%. Net income for the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Cash flow from operations was $90.9 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $10.6 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.9 million. We've continued to be active on the capital management front and our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. And during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares for consideration of $20.3 million. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares for consideration of $96.7 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 16.5 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To-date in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 98% free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $406 million. And at March 31, total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Adrienne, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Goodsall: I was just going to perhaps focus on masks. Just trying to sort of understand when we might expect -- or what internally you're seeing yourself doing when we might expect, I guess, that to sort of show up in the numbers in terms of recovery against, perhaps, when you moved your prices last year. And perhaps just a comment on the percentage conversion you might be seeing of your flow generators in the mask conversion -- why that's up perhaps a little higher?
Mick Farrell: That question allows us to talk a little bit about the mask side. And we're expecting to return to positive growth, not just in the Americas, but globally, to continue good trends we have outside the Americas. The mask category continues to be competitive Andrew, but stable. We'll be annualizing those price declines that we made a year ago, January through June of 2014, through January through June 2015. So we're over the halfway point, but there is still some sort of time to -- as we went customer by customer, region by region, for those to annualize. So as we look forward, we will get back to positive growth. And we have a strong mask portfolio and a good pipeline to follow beyond that.
Andrew Goodsall: And is it reasonable to sort of expect that you're achieving some level of, I guess, conversion along with the flow generator with your bundling or looking to sell the solution as a combined solution?
Mick Farrell: Andrew, there is some halo effect, certainly when you walk in with the value proposition of the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions. And as you saw, stellar growth of 42% year-on-year in the Americas there. You've obviously got a sales force with a lot of interest from their customers. And it allows conversations to start, obviously, about other parts of the business, like ventilation, like respiratory care and like masks. So I do think there are some halo effects that come from that. But I think some of the more important factors are the fact that we're annualizing the January to June price adjustments. The market is competitive and our team is getting back on the front foot in that category while winning very strongly in some other categories.
Operator: And the next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Margaret Kaczor: Couple ones from me. Can you maybe comment on U.S. generator growth which clearly accelerated this quarter. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing a similar growth rate that you saw in AirSense 10 last quarter or is that also accelerating?
Mick Farrell: Margaret, I'll take the first part of that question and I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, for the second one. Clearly, with a number like that that we probably haven't seen since 2006, 2007 of 42% growth for the quarter year-on-year in flow generators in the Americas, you're not just growing with the market. You're clearly taking some share. So to the extent that there is market share taking, that can happen for a period of time and then that period of time ends. But we do think that there's strong growth in the core U.S. market and, frankly, in our core global markets in the sleep disorder breathing space. And we expect that to continue, because we're vastly underpenetrated in developed markets as well as our developing and emerging markets. Jim, would you like to add any more color that?
Jim Hollingshead: Sure, Mick. Thanks. And thanks for the question, Margaret. We think that the flow gen growth represents not just the fact that the AirSense 10 platform and the AirCurve 10 platform are really strong products in their own right as flow gens and bilevels, but also the recognition on the part of our customers of the value of the all-in solution that we're offering. So both of those platforms have onboard communications, but it goes beyond just having an onboard modem. It allows our customers to drive efficiencies into their businesses through the use of our solution software platform. So the number of features related to our software that are driving efficiencies in our customers' business and we think we have a very clear advantage with the overall offer in the market right now that customers are taking advantage of.
Margaret Kaczor: Okay. So you guys are seeing kind of similar or maybe accelerating growth in AirSense as kind of the way that I read maybe that answer. And then Brett, can you walk us through the gross margins this quarter? You guys broadly talked about FX. Which currencies are most important? And then just to make sure, the price declines that you guys cited in the press release are really year over year versus sequential.
Brett Sandercock: On the gross margin, it's all the margin drivers, essentially, but I think it's happened for long time is really mostly sort of headwinds for us this time around. So we had, obviously, year-on-year your currency impact was negative for us. That's really being driven by the euro which has declined quite significantly, as I think everybody knows. We do get some offset for the Aussie dollar weakening, but to some extent, that's to the lag the quarter before it turns up in margin. So I do expect -- well, all things being equal on currency which is probably a big assumption, but I do expect with that Aussie weakness, some of that benefit will flow through into Q4 for us. We haven't seen that in Q3, but we do cop up front, if you like, that euro falls straightaway. So I think that's something that will help us going into Q4. But then you have other -- the product mix and geographic mix and really that's kind of driven by flow gen outperformance in the U.S.. So you've got that geographic impact and that product mix impact. And they've been negative for us as well. And really, even on the sort of optimization of production and manufacturing, something that we have a really good track record on, really haven't been able to focus on that just at the moment. We've really been looking to make sure that we meet demand in the marketplace. And obviously take for granted that we absolutely don't compromise on quality either, but what we have had to do is probably just delay a little bit on the cost-out programs. We're obviously getting on to those now and I think we'll see some benefit there. There are other things, like we've been running with much higher air freight than we typically would. Again, that's really a consequence of meeting demand, particularly on that flow gen growth number that you saw. So there is just a number of factors. A lot of those are kind of first-class problems to have. And the ones in the cost side though, they are under our control and we'll absolutely get on top of those.
Margaret Kaczor: Is there anything that you can quantify in that in terms of the FX impact this quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. If you looked at -- yes, I mean, the year-on-year -- without -- I don't get too granular, but it's quite meaningful, as it's north of 50 basis points negative.
Operator: And your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Wheen: Just a follow-up question on the gross margin. Brett, there is a lot of I guess, things that you can do going forward. I was just surprised to see your guidance for the fourth quarter be very much the same as third quarter. So can you tell us what is sort of holding you back on that front?
Brett Sandercock: I guess just looking at what we're seeing in terms of product and geographic trends, okay which it probably tend to be negative on that. But offsetting that, I think we'll see some benefit from the weaker Aussie and we will start to see some of our cost-out program gain some traction. So when you look at it, we have some -- going forward, looks like we have some negative drivers, if you like and then there is some positive ones. And there is a question of what the timing is like and how they balance up. And when I looked at it, I think in that kind of short term, where we broadly consistent with where we're in Q3, when we look forward and we look at some of the things that are coming through, if you think of the AirCurve on the bilevels, if you think of Astral and as we build that market in the U.S., clearly, those sort of products will be supportive of the margin. I think we'll get some momentum on our cost-out programs; that will be supportive of the margin. So you can see some of these shorter-term headwinds, I think, will certainly abate. And then some of them, I think, will turn positive for us. Yes, if you look forward, I think optimistic on the margin, but at the moment, we're dealing with quite a few headwinds. But notwithstanding those, I think the margin is in pretty good shape.
Steve Wheen: And could you just sort of provide some comment on some of the rest-of-world markets, maybe France, Germany and Japan? Perhaps most interest in Japan as to -- that's obviously been quite historically lumpy. What your experience was in the latest quarter for that region?
Mick Farrell: Steve, that's great question. I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to talk through those.
Rob Douglas: Thanks, Steve. So Japan, yes, is historically lumpy. It had a pretty good quarter this quarter with the products getting good take up going well. We continue to have excellent relationships with our customers and we stay in close touch. And the market there is very stable and moving along well, but will continue to be lumpy through the ordering patterns. Europe had a pretty good quarter as well. France performed well. There is still the debate going on in France over the telemonitoring, where for a while the rules were very supportive of telemonitoring and many, many telemonitored units were in the market there. But at the moment, it's still in a sort of a government legal case while they decide what their future policy is going to be, but the market there is again, stable and moving along well. And Germany is also moving well, both our home care business has been winning business and also our wholesale business there is working well. So Germany is moving well. Call out a highlight -- the UK has been very strong and some of our market development programs there are really gaining traction. And the basic fundamentals of the benefit of treating sleep apnea is so well understood in the healthcare system there that we're seeing good progress.
Operator: And your next question comes from Chris Kallos from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Chris Kallos: Brett, just to clarify, the adverse product mix in the U.S., you are suggesting that the success of the flow generators being a low-margin product has impacted the margin. Is that clear -- is that what you're saying?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, that's correct.
Chris Kallos: And just the other question I had was just can we get an update on Astral? How that's tracking?
Brett Sandercock: Sure, Chris. We'll take a broader view on that. Astral has had a good two or three quarters of runway in our European markets. And in those markets, Chris, we have more than a decade of established partnerships on the pulmonary critical care discharge from the hospital to home care environment. So Astral is seeing very good success and as Rob just sort of went into detail a little bit around France, Germany, UK and beyond in Western Europe. In the U.S. market, we launched it later. We launched it sort of in the August-September time frame. And in the U.S. market particularly, we're still developing the respiratory care channel and our strength and capability to sell into that. Having said that, we have many thousands of customers in the U.S. and all of them are now aware that ResMed has a life support ventilator, that it's called Astral and that it has some great benefits, such as giving freedom back to patients or the battery that can extend up to 24 hours away from home. So giving freedom back to their patients. So we think there are some great sort of unique selling propositions around it which will give us over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years, frankly, an opportunity to grow that business in that geography. So we're excited about Astral as a long term sustainable opportunity for us to drive high-margin flow generator growth.
Operator: Next your question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sean Laaman: Guys, I'm wondering if you can just talk about the pricing strategy on U.S. devices, particularly compared to the prior corresponding period. Thanks.
Jim Hollingshead: Sean, we haven't made any dramatic changes to our pricing strategy. The biggest thing we're seeing in pricing in the U.S., as we've discussed on the call, is the grandfathering in of some changes we made to our pricing approach last year at this time. So we're still working through some of the pricing changes we made during Q3 and Q4 of last year and that's grandfathering through. But other than that, we haven't made any dramatic changes to pricing.
Sean Laaman: And just one follow-up. Were there any sort of lumpy contracts in the U.S. device business sort of won or lost during the quarter compared to the prior corresponding period? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: But we don't go into details on a customer basis. It just doesn't make sense to go into that level of detail for competitive reasons on a public conference call like this. Thanks for the question, but we really can't answer that.
Operator: And your next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson: I guess I just wanted to go back to the gross margin. I know you mentioned the various factors that affected it, but I was just wondering -- if one, if you could quantify those. I know some of my other companies will talk about specific basis point impacts for currency, pricing, etcetera. And if you can't get into that level of detail, can you at least kind of prioritize them and tell us which ones -- what had the greatest, the least impact on the gross margin?
Brett Sandercock: Mike, we don't get quite as granular as that, but on those ones that I've mentioned, they all had -- if you looked at it year-on-year, they all had meaningful impact on the gross margin. Clearly, a mention on the FX impact which was quite large and then product and geographic mix had a quite large impact as well. And then [indiscernible] declines year-on-year also that we've been discussing. All of them were kind of meaningful contributors to that gross margin decline.
Mike Matson: Okay. But would you say pricing -- I mean, I think investors are going to be concerned about pricing. And given these other factors, just wondering if you could -- was the pricing kind of equivalent to these other things? Was it more; was it less than the other factors taken individually?
Brett Sandercock: They are all meaningful and not -- there wasn't any particular one that overwhelmed the rest, let me put it that way, that were kind of all there in the mix which is really unusual for us to have almost all of them as a headwind. So it's not like any of them were completely driving it, but when you take them as a sum total, then that adds up to quite a large contraction that we saw.
Mike Matson: Okay. And then just on the SERVE-HF clinical data. So when that comes out, assuming data is strong and positive, how do we think about -- think through the impact of that on your business, on your flow generators? I guess it would ultimately translate into sales of the -- I can't think of the name it of now -- but the SV product. MSV or whatever it's called product. And what's the timing of that? Do you expect that to kind of pick up immediately? Pick up just in Europe first? Do you have to get some additional indications approved through the FDA in the U.S. before you can really market it for the heart failure patient population, etcetera?
Mick Farrell: SERVE-HF is a multiyear journey for us going back a number of years. And we expect that sort of first publication of the trial results before the end of the calendar year. You know, that's almost the starting gun that would go off on a long journey, Mike. And there are multiple outcomes in a trial like this. There is the outcome that could improve cardiovascular outcomes. There's an outcome that could improve bigger things, like morbidity or mortality in intention and trade versus per protocol analyses. And so many analyses that the primary investigators will have to do from when they crack the code all the way through to when they present the results and then later publish them in a peer reviewed published journal. So there's a long lead time. To your point, it will benefit the business. Mike, I find the easier brand to remember is PaceWave. So the PaceWave product will be picking up from that. And studies both used PaceWave SERVE-HF and the CAT-HF. So we're excited to have that sort of proprietary technology included in the trial. But it's a long journey from there. And so you won't see an immediate inflection point the day of presentation at whichever cardiology conference it may be. What you'll see is the starting gun go off on a marathon opportunity for us which goes over multiple quarters and multiple years. And really, a lot of it comes down to changing standard-of-care country by country, hospital by hospital, payer by payer and, frankly, cardiology and pulmonary group by cardiology and pulmonary group and getting them to partner across hospitals and we see it as a great long term opportunity for us.
Mike Matson: Okay. And just in the U.S., is there anything from a regulatory standpoint you're going to need to do once that data is out? Or can you just go ahead and begin to target the U.S. heart failure market as well?
Mick Farrell: Well, in the U.S., our indication for use to treat central sleep apnea, periodic breathing and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. So we'll be focusing on that in the U.S. In other markets in different parts of the world, there will be different approaches of working with cardiology groups. But in the U.S., it will be focused on what we do in treating these very severe types of sleep disorder breathing amongst chronic disease patients.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.
David Stanton: I wonder if you could give us an update on your views in terms of overall market growth rates in the U.S. and Europe? Where do think that's accelerating from the 4% to 6% that you previously talked about, given the strong growth that we've seen in this quarter and previous quarters as well. That's my first question. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: David, look, it's really hard being the only public company that sort of talks on a 90-day cycle here about growth rates to get details of the market growth rates. We talk about it in the mid-single digits in the U.S. and Western Europe. I think there certainly are regions and countries where you're getting double-digit growth, mostly in the emerging markets. We talked earlier about China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, where we're really partnering with our channel and focusing on growth in those areas. And then you get some opportunities, like we have with Air Solutions and what it has driven in great value to customers. And you get some share gains as part of that as well. Has market growth tipped up a little because we're moving to connected care models and we're partnering with integrated delivery networks and accountable care organizations? I would say it's a little early for that traction to have started to really move the market in growth. I think that's more of a longer-term story, as you look out sort of one year, three years, five years, where you'll start to see us be able to influence market growth by the great solutions we're providing to take patients out of hospitals, put them in homes and save money for broken healthcare systems. So I think we're still sort of looking in that mid-single-digit range. But again, it's blurry and there's a lot of multiple data sources to get to that.
David Stanton: And I guess my follow-up to that is as it is getting a little bit closer, can you give us sort of your views on where you see the introduction of the third round of competitive bidding in the U.S. for next year? What that will do, perhaps in your eyes to those market growth rates? Thanks very much.
Mick Farrell: So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel.
Dave Pendarvis: CB3, as it's been announced, is pretty much a known quantity now, so that's a good thing. There's stability and predictability in the market for our U.S. customers. They now know that in January of 2016, there begins a phased process that runs through the middle of the year, where reimbursement will be adjusted. There's still some questions about rural adjustments, where there can be a 110% of the national rates. But by and large, CB3 should be predictable and therefore, business planning can occur with customers knowing what the reimbursement is they're going to face. And without there being a reduction in the number of authorized customers or authorized suppliers in a region, we don't expect the kind of disruption that we saw in the second round of competitive bidding. I'm not sure that that would have a significant impact on growth rates. Obviously, the patients are getting diagnosed and that reimbursement for diagnosis isn't changing. I think our best guess would be that the growth rates would stay roughly the same in those markets that are affected by the third round of competitive bidding.
Operator: And your next question comes from William Dunlop from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
William Dunlop: I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the level of competition you're seeing in masks?
Mick Farrell: Sure, William. Masks are multiple categories. You have the full-face masks, you have nasal pillows and then you have nasal masks. And in each of those subcategories, there are multiple players in multiple countries competing with their own innovation. What I can tell you is that it is a competitive game. And we're innovating incredibly well and some of our competitors are doing a reasonable job, too. And what that allows is good competition in a market, healthy competition in a market and the opportunity for us and our competitors to present those opportunities to patients, to HME providers and to clinicians and get them excited about what we have. So as you go through each of the categories and you go through each of the countries, you win in some categories and in some countries and then you don't win for a while in some categories and countries. But over the long term, what we've showed at ResMed that of the 7% of our revenues that we invest in research and development, we put a good chunk of that into world-leading mask and patient interface, more generally and accessory research. And we have, I would say, across countries and across the categories some world-leading innovation that's doing very well and more in the pipeline. As I said, we're going to get back to positive growth in our major geographies and around the world on that. And we're confident about that.
William Dunlop: And just following on from that, last quarter, you mentioned that you think you probably took market share sequentially in masks. Would you be able to comment on what you think market share did in this quarter? And just finally, are you able to elaborate more on the pipeline that you just mentioned?
Mick Farrell: I'll take the second part first. And the answer to that is no. We're not going to go into details on the pipeline. And I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim to talk about relative share that you might've seen, particularly in the U.S. geography.
Jim Hollingshead: Yes, I mean, it's a typical member to get to, market share, because there's not terrific data. But based upon what we see in the market, we think the shares are relatively stable and probably we took a little bit of share on the margin in the quarter, but it's very, very difficult to estimate. So if you went with stable shares, you probably wouldn't be far off.
William Dunlop: So that implies that the mask market in the U.S. is perhaps going backwards, if you took a little bit of share in the quarter?
Mick Farrell: Well you know, you got the difference between unit share and then you've got revenue share. And you've got pricing and many factors into that, William. So one of the things that we've said on these calls is we're not going to go into details of year-on-year price deltas. And so if we start to talk about volumes and exactly where that's at, then everyone can reverse engineer the pricing, including competitors or others who may be reading the transcript or listening to this call. William, I appreciate where you're going in the drill down, but I think we're going to have to go to the next question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Low: Brett, if I could just start with a quick one on other income line. I was wondering if you could talk what's in that? Is it largely FX hedge gain?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, the majority of that is some FX hedge gains and that was largely around our other euro hedging structures, yes.
David Low: And just the only other one I had was with the very strong sales growth you saw in the U.S. devices. Just wondering if you are on backorder or whether you've been able to fully supply those orders?
Mick Farrell: No, David, we're off backorder in the U.S.. Flow generators and that's a really good thing. The downside of that, as Brett said is that we're doing a lot more air freight than we would like at this time. And so as we start to -- and Brett and Don and the team in Sydney are really getting the factory there, both there and in Singapore, moving. So we will expect to start to move from air freight to sea freight. And as Brett said earlier, to start those cost-out programs over the coming quarters to get us back on track there. But no, we were not on backorder this quarter which is a good thing.
Operator: And the next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: Maybe to focus in on U.S. flow gens as well. Just trying to get a sense of AirCurve in the quarter or were there any large stocking orders on the bilevels in the quarter? I know it was launched late last quarter, so was just wondering the extent of the impact in this quarter? And then a follow-up.
Mick Farrell: Jim, do you want to take the question about the orders? Do you know how it impacted inventory-wise or replacements?
Jim Hollingshead: It's not something we have perfect visibility into, but I didn't see anything unusual in the quarter in terms of stocking orders. The year got off to a really good start since its launch and so it's on a really good growth and adoption ramp. And we think we're taking share in that category as well as in APAP and CPAP. But we didn't see anything unusual.
Mick Farrell: Yes, I think what you saw last quarter was a good ramp up of the AirSense 10. And what you saw this quarter was a good ramp up of the AirCurve 10 combined with ongoing ramp up of the AirSense 10. You have the addition of Astral, mainly in Europe, but starting to happen in the U.S. geography, Anthony.
Anthony Petrone: And then the second one is on CHF. And just trying to get a sense of how this plays out potentially into 2016, specifically from an operational standpoint. So I would imagine some of the R&D expenses will fall off when SERVE-HF is done. So is that the case? And will that be completely offset by reinvestments into the marketing efforts for SERVE-HF or is that a net benefit?
Mick Farrell: Yes, good question about SERVE-HF. And as we start to complete that study, what you should realize is usually when these studies go out, there are a number of follow-on publications that look to analyze the data that we've collected over these 5 years to 7 years from different angles to produce different things. And so I would expect ongoing analysis and research, certainly on the buyer statistician side and analysis of the data from investigators and workers on the study. Yes, but certainly the day-to-day recruitment of patients does slow down as you move off those studies. But one thing about ResMed, Anthony, is that we take a long term view and we invest for the long term. And so the growing needs and opportunities for us in healthcare informatics, for instance, are an area that we're investing in and we'll continue to ramp up our investment. The growing opportunities to develop channels and research around COPD and the mortality rate that you saw in the current line study that we talked about two quarters ago, where you have a 76% relative reduction in mortality for COPD patients treated with noninvasive ventilation. I mean, there are so many opportunities for research in the COPD side that I wouldn't -- if I was running your model for FY '16, I wouldn't be pulling out R&D dollars for ResMed. I would say ResMed is going to reinvest and keep that sort of 5 year, 10 year, 15 year view that clinical research drives market development, drives market growth and drives value for patients. And that's something that we focus on for the long term.
Operator: And your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Saul Hadassin: Brett, just a question on operating cash flow. I think I heard you right. You mentioned for the quarter, it was around $91 million or $90.9 million. Just wondering if you could give us what that might have been in constant currency or what the FX impact was? Because that looks like it's down fairly materially on the PCP. And just a follow-up to that question is just what's happening on the receivables side in terms of trading terms? That would be great. Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I'll take the first one on receivables on the sort of -- our days sales and trading terms, they were pretty consistent with where they've been kind of this time last year and over the last few quarters. So I think that's been pretty stable. On the operating cash flow front, yes, it's down on PCP. But around the euro and the decline and so on, that would certainly hurt us a little bit on the cash flow front. But you've got to be a bit cautious, because they are 90 day snapshots on the cash flow. I think I prefer to look at it more of a longer-term trend on the cash flow. So PCP was down a little bit. I think overall, the cash flow remains quite strong, although yes, probably hurt a little bit on the FX front.
Operator: And your next question comes from Craig Collie from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Craig Collie: Two for me. The first, just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the very impressive flow gen growth number. Mick, could you perhaps give us a little bit of flavor as to the waitings of some of the separate drivers, in particular share gains from, I guess, new patients being diagnosed with sleep apnea versus the installed base upgrading versus perhaps bilevels and cardiorespiratory cells?
Mick Farrell: Yes, I mean, to the comments I made earlier, clearly, a number of 42% in the U.S. geography, given the large base we have there, is exceptional. And it's exceptionally good, but it is exceptional and it did include a big chunk of share gain that we would know. To delve out exactly what was market growth versus share gain growth, I'll leave the mathematics of that up to you and the other experts on the call. But as I look to the sustainability of the long term underlying growth there, I think it is there in that good solid mid-single-digit market growth that we talked about. The difference between AirSense 10 which is in its third quarter, I guess, of real moving up that S-curve of launch and AirCurve 10 which is just finishing its first full quarter and then you add in Astral which is got, for the U.S. market, a much longer penetration curve to go, you can sort of get into some pretty complex calculations as to exactly what shares they'll be. What we're focused on is really the long term, Craig. We're absolutely taking share in sleep disorder breathing, but more importantly than that, we're switching the industry to focus on healthcare informatics as a value play. That taking data to the cloud is not enough. You have to then take that data and provide solutions for your customers, to take cost out of the channel, to get efficiencies. And for patients, physicians and providers to all get real-time data so that they can make their businesses better, make the patients better and improve outcomes and so it's sort of a long term gain versus, for us, let's analyze the 90 days and look at it. And I think what the milestone of that 42% says the long term game is the right game and it's got some capability. And we should double down our investment in that space.
Craig Collie: And then just lastly, any updates on a potential pilot for bundling?
Mick Farrell: So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis to talk about bundling associated with CB for future rounds.
Dave Pendarvis: It's really been no news on that front. So you know, the situation remains that there is an initial proposal from CMS, that they suggested they might run a bundling pilot. There are no more details on what that pilot might look like, when, if at all, it would go into effect. And we've just heard nothing else. So really no developments on that front.
Operator: Yes, we will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Mick Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, Adrienne. In closing, I would like to thank the more than 4000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives, literally with every breath. We certainly remain inspired by our long term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today. We hope to see many of you at our ResMed Investor Day which we're holding this June 2015 in San Francisco. More details from Agnes on that later.
Agnes Lee: Yes. And thank you all for joining us again today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available in the investor relations section of our website at resmed.com. Okay, Adrienne, you can close now.
Operator: This concludes ResMed's third quarter earnings live webcast. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the second quarter 2015 ResMed Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Ellen, and thank you everyone for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders, who are joining us on today's investor call, as we provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we achieved very strong sales growth this quarter with excellent progress from new product launches in our core market of sleep disordered breathing, as well as our cardio and respiratory care markets. In the introductory remarks, I'll discuss our sales achievements; I'll also provide an update on our product launches; and finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then, I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth in Q2 or 14% on a constant currency basis. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 10% year-on-year. We saw strength across all geographic regions, with robust double-digit growth in the Americas as well as double-digit growth in our combined European and Asia-Pac regions on a constant currency basis. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in our sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease. We delivered gross margin of 62.2%, which was just above the middle of our guidance range for the quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest SG&A to promote our global product launches. As a percentage of sales, SG&A remained roughly in line on a year-over-year basis at 29% of sales. We also continued to invest in research and development, as we continue to innovate to build long-term, sustainable, competitive advantage in the marketplace. R&D represented about 7% of revenues, which is slightly down from prior quarters, primarily as a result of currency movements, particularly in the Australian dollar. Looking at the bottomline, our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $0.64. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was a $0.01 higher at $0.65. Zooming in on our combined European and Asia-Pac businesses, we grew at 16% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. Including currency headwinds, we achieved 8% headline growth for our combined European and Asia-Pac business units. This robust sales performance came from the balance of flow generator growth, associated with our new product launches, as well as strong growth in masks and accessories in the region. With long multi-year product lifecycles for new device platforms, our flow generator launches are still in their early days. We see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac for both the AirSense 10 and the Astral platforms, as we look forward. We have seen strong early interest in our Air Solutions platform in Europe, and we will continue to invest and grow that opportunity overtime. It is important to note that the digitization of medicine in the respiratory space is becoming a truly global trend. And it's a trend that ResMed is leading. Zooming out to a higher level, we believe that noninvasive homecare ventilation solutions combined with robust healthcare informatics solutions will be critical to improving patient outcomes and lowering costs for COPD and heart failure patients within global healthcare systems. This is an important macro trend and we will continue to partner with patients, physicians, hospitals, homecare providers, payers and governments to help solve the chronic disease problem. We see a significant unmet medical need and a huge opportunity. We are rapidly growing the European respiratory care market. Our established channels in Western European countries have helped us to build good momentum over the last eight months with the launch of our new life support ventilator, the Astral platform in the region. In addition, during the second quarter, we continue to invest for longer-term growth in Asia-Pacific. We are investing in both respiratory care and sleep apnea channel development to help create and lead both sleep apnea and home ventilation markets in Asia-Pac, with a focus on the significant growth opportunity potential in both China and India. Moving on to Americas results, we had a strong performance in Q2 from the region, with the Americas sales team driving 12% year-on-year growth. We have both good momentum and high morale within the team, as our innovative solutions meet and beat customer needs. We are particularly pleased with initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches with 25% year-on-year growth for that category in the Americas region. Let me drill into the U.S. flow generator category in some detail and talk about three key product launches, the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and then our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. When talking about the AirSense 10, we have to discuss the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem that surrounds it. One of the key reasons the AirSense 10 product has exceeded our expectations is the value provided by Air Solutions. We continue to hear positive feedback from customers about this end-to-end solution, including its quantifiable benefit for patients, providers, physicians and even payers and hospitals. We are still in early days for Air Solutions and we will continue to enhance its offerings, but all indicators point to the fact that we have a winning value proposition. We are providing an opportunity to drive more efficiency, to increase adherence and to improve patient care, all by liberating data and empowering all players in the value chain. AirView, U-Sleep and myAir are just some of the key components of the Air Solutions ecosystem. As you may remember, we ended last quarter with a backlog on the AirSense 10. This quarter, I am happy to report that our operational excellence went into play, and we've been able to swiftly ramp up our supply chain and manufacturing system to make demand. We are still working through each detail production combination to get ahead of demand and build out appropriate levels of safety stock. But it is important to note that any remaining product backlogs are immaterial to the business. The second U.S. flow generator subcategory I want to discuss is the AirCurve 10, which is the bilevel group. As expected, we launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December, the final month of the quarter. And we are receiving good early customer feedback. The AirCurve 10 devices are an integral part of the Air Solutions platform that I mentioned earlier. So this, the AirCurve 10, is a cloud connected bilevel system that leverages the same end-to-end workforce solution that we provide with the AirSense 10 device range. We have introduced the AirCurve 10 less than four months after introducing the AirSense 10. That is a significant improvement for us over the launches of our two previous generations, the S9 and the S8. With just less than a month of sales in Q2 and with its launch limited to just the U.S. market geography, the AirCurve 10 is in its very early days of launch. Looking at the masks and accessories category in the Americas, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We continue gain share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 remain excellent. On a sequential basis, volumes were up and prices were relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, we are starting to see stability in pricing, as we are seeing more steady markets this year than last year. As a reminder, we are expecting pricing in the U.S. to be an easier comparable for year-on-year revenue numbers, after the end of our next quarter ending March 2015. It is important to note that the price adjustments that we started 12 months ago were phased in from January to June 2014 on a product-by-product and a customer-by-customer basis. The facts are that the masks and accessories category continues to be competitive and we are continuing to drive the business in a dynamic market and in a dynamic method. Moving to the respiratory care market, we continue to receive good feedback on our Astral platform, as we launch it to key opinion leader physicians, HMA customers and hospitals across the United Sates. We look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral. With our VPAP COPD device and our Astral platform, as a combined offering in this space, we are uniquely positioned to provide doctors and patients the right treatment, at the right price, at the right time. Now, I'd like to take a broader longer-term global view and spend some time talking about the progress against our three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which includes our core sleep apnea market, we are driving Healthcare Informatics solutions and software engineering innovation, with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and our AirSense 10 platform, as I mentioned earlier. With the launch of the AirCurve 10 platform, we are positioned to drive the efficiency, adherence and the outcomes value proposition even deeper within global markets. The AirCurve 10 range spans from basic bilevel functionality, all the way up to noninvasive ventilation as well as Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology. To sharpen our focus on informatics solutions, this quarter Rob and I established a new global business unit for Healthcare Informatics here at ResMed. This global team will be led by Raj Sodhi. Raj was the CEO and Co-Founder of Umbian, which is a software-as-a-service company that you recall we bought in 2012. Raj has deep experience in running, growing and scaling, both secure and fast moving transactional data systems. And he has had a big impact in the time he's been here at ResMed. He's made the move from Halifax to San Diego, and we welcome him onboard. Healthcare Informatics is now a core competence for our company. It is also a major area for investment that we are using to drive, count and future, customer value. We are leading the digitalization of medicine in the respiratory space, and we are just getting started. On the legal front, in December, we won a patent infringement case against a Chinese-based competitor in the U.S. International Trade Commission, when the commission ruled that their masks infringe our patents. At ResMed, we are committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and defending our over 5,000 patents and designs, so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions more lives as we go forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment, which is approximately 7% of our revenue this quarter in research and development, with a focus on pioneering clinical research and world leading by medical engineering. We are making solid progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market as well as new emerging market growth opportunities. We continue to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business, where we have had a leading presence in homecare ventilation for a number of years. We continue to build our respiratory care channels and strength in the U.S. geography. We have 18 million patients suffering from COPD in the word and 5% to 10 of them being candidates for noninvasive ventilation; we have a lot of runway in front of us. We start adding opportunities from neuromuscular disease like ALS, we are adding muscular dystrophy; we can help millions of patients and also save hundreds of millions of dollars for healthcare systems, by taking care of these patients at home rather than in the hospital. Patients want that, physician want that, payers want that. With accountable care organizations, integrated delivering networks and growing payer-provider models in the U.S. as well as the mostly government-run healthcare systems in Europe and Asia-Pac, we can now say that hospital systems and hospital CEO's are starting to drive towards that same goal. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with strong double-digit growth this quarter. We have established long-term investment plans for China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe to ensure that we help establish good protocols for hospital to home as well as the right care models, so that patients and physicians can remain connected. With increasing healthcare investments in emerging markets, we look forward to working with government, so that they can know that they are improving patient outcomes and also being efficient with limited healthcare funds using objective, quantifiable outcomes data. Our third and final horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure patients. Our SERVE-HF trial is on track and going well. We are now expecting presentation and publication of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators some time in light calendar year 2015 or early calendar year 2016. We continue to see excitement in the heart failure and sleep apnea space, and we are facilitating strong partnerships between cardiologists and pulmonary physicians as well as homecare providers. For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we continue to enroll patients every week, and we expect that CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes and to help lead a change in standard of care for heart failure patients. It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary PaceWave, Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology. We will continue to provide updates, as significant milestones are reached in both of these important, global, pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You'll hear more about these actions in Q2 from Brett in a few moments. Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long-term three horizons growth strategy and assets that we can leverage to enhance long-term shareholder value. We have opportunities on our radar screen of all sizes. We have over $400 million in net cash on our balance sheet and significant borrowing capacity. So we have the dry powder that we need to acquire the right assets at the right time and at the right price. Let me close with this, we are excited about our long-term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We are executing well to that plan. We continue to lead the market with innovative products, services and solutions that achieve three important end goals that we call, the Holy Grail. Goal one, improve patient quality of life; goal two, halt the progression of important key chronic diseases; and point three, lower the costs of highly-stressed healthcare systems around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the December quarter was $423 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $13.8 million in the second quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $231 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $192 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $111 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $120 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $129 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 17%. Masks and other sales were $63 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20%, while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margins for the December quarter were 62.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 250 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we now expect to see only a very minor positive impact on gross margin, as the impact from a weaker Australian dollar will be largely offset by the weaker euro. Looking forward in the second half of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 62%, given likely trends in geographic and product mix. As always, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.5 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, higher variable employee compensation, some impacts on the recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29% compared to the year ago figure of 29.1%. And looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for the second half of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis an increase of 7%, reflecting incremental investment in areas of Healthcare Informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority our R&D is denominated. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 21.1%, and we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will in fact be in the vicinity of 21%. Net income for the quarter was $91.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements did negatively impact second quarter earnings per share, but this impact was less than $0.01 year-over-year. The impact from the weaker euro was essentially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Cash flow from operations was $106 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.9 million. We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and during the quarter we repurchased 667,000 shares for consideration of $33.5 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 16.8 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To date, in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 101% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we have returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $431 million and at December 31 total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A session of the call. We ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Ellen, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.
Margaret Kaczor: Mick, can you maybe give us some more color in terms of components of that strong U.S. slower growth. You had mentioned that backlog was immaterial going forward, but how much of an impact did that have this quarter versus next towards auto and bilevels and vents?
Michael Farrell: So the backlog was pretty modest, Margaret, last quarter. We brought it up, because we thought it was important to just be fully transparent about that. That was in a couple of different stock keeping units, the particular one was the AutoSet for Her stocking keeping unit, which was a brand new algorithm, the first ever introduced to the global market of an algorithm for female breathing patterns. And it was taken up much faster by physicians and homecare providers in the U.S. channel than we had thought. And there were a couple of other varieties, where the ClimateLine air tube goes in or not in the device and some bundling SKUs that were also in backorder. And so what we did in the 90 days is ensure that we got the supply chain up to speed and we're able to deliver that. So as you looked at the 25% year-on-year growth in Americas flow generators, a very small portion of that was to sort of catch up on the backlog. And as we look forward, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is immaterial backlog left. There's still a couple of ones that we are working through, but it's not going to affect the ongoing business, Margaret.
Margaret Kaczor: And then in terms of international, I mean again very strong growth out there. What were the country-by-country breakdown, was it Japan, Germany? And then maybe give us more clarity as to why?
Michael Farrell: I'll hand to Rob, our COO, present to answer that question.
Robert Douglas: Yes, Margaret. We are pretty strong on most of the countries. You would call out France and Japan, but a lot of the other European countries are very strong. We don't give detailed breakdown of all of that, and so we won't be doing that. But really underlying it, patient flows remain strong in all those markets. They haven't all got AirSense 10 yet, but in the markets where they do have it, which is most of them, it's had a very good reception. And as Mick was saying earlier, the Air Solutions is very positive part of the value proposition. And then, of course, Astral was also in the market in Europe. And also, as we said earlier, we've been selling successfully our life support ventilation and it has a strong market position there, and the Astral is building on that and already generating good momentum.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Goodsall with UBS.
Andrew Goodsall: I just want to talk about gross margin, just to understand where you are in the cycle. Previously, when you've launched a new product, you've been able to extract some costs, I guess, from manufacturers. So just trying to understand a little bit more where you are in that, and I guess, in particular, with the manufacturing mainly in Australia or Singapore at this stage?
Michael Farrell: So I'll answer the first part and then maybe handover to Brett to address the second part. I mean with regard to gross margin, in general, when we are successful in growing very well in our flow generators, it's very good in driving the topline, but it has some negative implications on gross margin, so you get the positives of the revenue and the implications on the gross margin. And as we are more successful in growing in the Americas, again, it's very good in driving the topline, but can have an impact on the gross margin. So this quarter you saw very strong growth in flow generators globally and you saw very strong growth in the Americas, and so there was some impact on the gross margin. But, Brett, do you want to provide a little bit more color and detail for Andrew into gross margin, and maybe the guidance of 60% to 62% going forward.
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Sure, Mick. And so we just brought it down a little bit really on those factors that I spoke about. With the AirSense and Air Solutions as a whole platform, if you recall, we did elect to put the built-in comms and reinvest some sort of typical savings that we make on platforms back into the platform. I think that's really created quite -- along with whole ecosystem, I think very compelling value prop in the marketplace. So we've done that and we do obviously run cost-out programs and so on, but just in the short-term we've really been focused on ratcheting up supplies to really make demand. So this probably puts a little bit further back in terms of some of these cost-out programs, which will certainly run. But that might be quite short-term, until we catch up with demand properly, and then we can start running those, and start optimizing the factory on efficiencies and so on, rather than just supply. So I think in the longer-term, I'm talking a lot, but after a few quarters, I think we've got some good opportunities to drive some of the cost out the platform, as we did for S9.
Operator: The next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley.
Sean Laaman: Just a question on mask in U.S., could you give us a bit of sense, please, Mick, on volume against price?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Sean, so actually I'm going to hand that question to Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas business. Volumes and price for masks.
Jim Hollingshead: Thanks, Mick. Sean, we're seeing good volume growth in masks. And as Mick said in prepared comments, the AirFit line is doing very well. It's being very well received across all three categories, and sequentially we continue to take share in all three categories. I know we've talked about a change in pricing strategy that we had several months ago, and what we're going to see I think is we're against the tougher pricing comp right now, probably through our March quarter than we have been. So I think what we'll see is, with the volume growth we'll also see some improved results, as the pricing sort of cascade through. I think its worth noting that there wasn't a cliff event in that. So what we did, when we changed our pricing strategy in the category, was we empowered our sales representatives to negotiate pricing on a customer-by-customer basis. And so I think we'll see that comparable in terms of ASP feather-in over the course of the second half of the year.
Operator: The next question is from David Low with Deutsche Bank.
David Low: Just sticking with that mask issue, I have worried for a while now that the mask re-supply business might slow down, as the number of masks to patients doesn't match needs. I'm just wondering whether you get any sense, as to what market growth has been like in the last quarter and even the last year across the mask end of all categories?
Michael Farrell: The line was quite soft. So for those who didn't hear the question, it was about mask re-supply and questions of volume really going over versus the sort of price, year-on-year price elements that Jim was talking about. Well, yes, as I said in the introductory remarks and as Jim just commented right now, actually our volume growth both on a year-on-year basis and on a sequential basis is pretty solid in masks. And we actually have pretty good market share data, which we won't share here publicly, David, with regard to each of those categories nasal, pillows, full face, right. So with the N10, the P10 and the F10, we believe we talk incremental sequential volume share from Q1 to Q2, and the products are doing very well out in the market. And to your broader question that the market segment of mask replenishment, it's actually growing quite well, not just within the U.S. market, which I think your question was related to, but also globally. And you saw that in our numbers. One thing that we are working very carefully on is ensuring patients get access to great care. When they get great care, so the informatics systems are there to allow the doctors to interface with them through the Air Solutions platform, when they're engaging with their own therapy through myAir, which is a personalized app for patients, we find that adherence goes up. The U-Sleep program we have running there drives adherence up by up to 10 percentage points, and that drives ongoing adherence and use. So we feel quite confident going forward that volume mask growth will be there. And as we get into more stable pricing environments that you'll start to see that come in through the revenue numbers. That's our long-term goal and that's what we're executing to.
David Low: And just one quick follow-up. Market growth rates, I mean clearly we've went through competitive bidding. I presume things have stabilized. Do you have any sense as to whether or do you have a view as to where the market growth has picked up in the last quarter or two?
Michael Farrell: I think when you look at a global level, we've got pretty good set of mid-single digit market growth. Our goal is not to accept market growth, but to drive market growth. As you saw our numbers this quarter, we are ahead of that global market growth and that comes from our investments. Brett talked about some of the investments in putting a CDMA chip in every device. That's an investment in driving a value proposition that is now allowing us to achieve very strong flow generator growth in our CPAP and APAP category. That's then going to happen in our bilevel category. We make investments, as we talked about in China and India, by partnering with local governments and partnering to developed infrastructure and education of physicians to facilitate the growth of both sleep apnea and respiratory care opportunity. So we think that those market growth rates are not only sustainable, but we are expanding beyond them with our cardiorespiratory care, our SERVE-HF investment and others.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan.
Steve Wheen: Just a question for Brett, just on the gross margin guidance, there is obviously a few moving parts there. I wonder if you could just separate out what the currency-related effect on that gross margin shift down that you are expecting for the remainder of this calendar year?
Brett Sandercock: Going forward, Steve, if you look at currency impacts and it's so volatile at a moment, I'm kind of bit reticent than say anything. But if you looked at it right here now, whilst we're expecting a reasonable benefit maybe a quarter or two ago, that's really down, I think probably a positive benefit as little as 10 basis points going into Q3. And it will be a little better in Q4 and get a bit more of the Aussie coming through, because of that lag impact. But the fairly small now, given how weak the euro has been. I mean we're still in pretty reasonable position, because the Aussie is essentially offsetting that weakness in the euro. But we are not getting as a pronounced benefit as we might have seen, if we were talking about this 36 months ago.
Steve Wheen: So the major driver of you downgrading, I guess, your expectations around gross margin, what would be the major driver there?
Michael Farrell: Look, the trends around geographic around product mix, I think if you looked at likely trends there, I think that's just enough that we feel that the margin might trend down a little, and we wanted to just bring that guidance down a little to account for that.
Operator: The next question is from David Clair with Piper Jaffray.
David Clair: My first question is on the flow generator number in the U.S. I'm just wondering if you can give us some more detail behind what drove the strength there. I mean are we seeing, is that Astral getting traction or it's just the new product launches in general? And then, you face another pretty easy comp next quarter, so should we think that I guess a result in this ballpark is achievable again next quarter?
Michael Farrell: Well, thanks, David. I'll take the first half of the question, and hand the second half to Rob. With the first half of where the growth came from in the quarter for the flow generators in the Americas, we launched both the AirSense 10 and the Astral to our U.S. sales force at the same time. It was at the Americas Sales Meeting in August, here in San Diego, and then the teams had to get out there and talk to their customers around the traps and get them up to speed. For the AirSense 10, the value proposition was built-in. And as I talked about, it's not about the AirSense 10, it's about the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem. And it sounds like a whole bunch of buzz was, but when you drill it down, what it does is it save costs and it saves time, and it saves money for our homecare provider customers. And so patients gets more engaged in their therapy and physicians allows them to do management by exception and manage a whole portfolio of patients. And so when you nail value propositions for three of your key constituents and they get it, you get a really quick ramp up. And now our U.S. sleep and respiratory distribution system is very good, second to none in the U.S. market. And so I think that's what drove the vast majority of the very successful sort of 25% year-on-year growth for the Americas in flow gens for the quarter. Your question was, is it Astral? Astral, we are just developing the U.S. respiratory channel for life support ventilation. It's the first FDA 510(k) clearance we've had of a life support ventilator. And we've got a very strong Respiratory Account Manager or RAM team out there around the United States driving the message. But it will take some time for the homecare providers to test the product and get to like it and for the doctors to get used to, how it works, doing the settings at the RT, the respiratory therapist level and driving it. So it's a much longer and deeper S-curve, but its impact in that first quarter was much less than the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform. So that's the first half about the products. It's mostly AirSense 10 and much less Astral. Rob, do you want to take the thoughts for next quarter?
Robert Douglas: Yes, obviously, when I get specific about what's coming up on the quarters, but what we play is it the value proposition behind the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform is quite solid. We're not resting on our laurels around that and our team is doing everything to promote it and convert our customers to it. Also, our in-house teams are still continually developing it, and we've got a lot of improvements, but again it come through in that system in the near-term future. So our view is that this value proposition should keep being seen by the customer, and the results will then speak for themselves. Similarly, with Astral, it's still early days in that product, and we believe that it's performing very well and getting a great response and we think that should continue. So over the long-term those products are really going to keep contributing for us.
David Clair: And then any updates, where we are in terms of home sleep testing?
Michael Farrell: David, home sleep testing, are you talking globally or U.S. geography?
David Clair: U.S.?
Michael Farrell: U.S. So within the U.S. market, we have sort of two models. We have our own ResMed model and then we have a retrospective data analysis, where we look at both public data and some private data. The proprietary data that we get access to and those models provide a range, and so we based on those two models believe that anywhere 35% to 45%. When you take a trialing 12 months anywhere between 35% to 45% of the sleep diagnostic tests in the U.S. were done using home sleep testing. But it's growing everyday, it's growing every quarter. And as broken out by geography and healthcare system type, if you take, I don't know, the northeast maybe Massachusetts and look at an area where you have a specialty benefits manager driving with a payer, a model, you can get areas where it's up to 75% or 80%-plus home sleep testing within that type of a system. And then you can get states in this out like Alabama, where there is a very strong push from the local physicians groups and it's only 5% of the tests within that geography. And so you've got a big range and it's very hard to put a precise number on it. So the range is 35% to 45%. But we expect it to go up every quarter, because the payers are driving it in and pushing that forward. Our challenge in making it all happen is ensuring that we provide the right systems to both ways of getting diagnosis done. So we have the ApneaLink Air platform, which is a cloud-connected home sleep testing system. That after the device is finished, the data go to the cloud, and you can see the doctor that day, and they have access to the information you got from that previous night. And we think that sort of efficiency in taking care of patients and helping doctors and helping the system work is very important for us. We also have partner with sleep labs, and we have the VPAP TX titration system, which is basically a box that has all of our algorithms in one box. And the respiratory PSG technicians, the RPSGTs and the sleep physicians can operate and prescribe Adaptive-Servo Ventilation or bilevel ST or APAP out of that. What we're seeing with that trend, as the home sleep testing of 35% to 45% increases to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55% overtime is that you get a mix shift in the devices that come out on the backend, so that you get more of a mix shifts from CPAP to APAP. So in our case, from our basic CPAPs up to our AutoSet type product.
Operator: The next question is from Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin: Mick, just following up on that commentary around that mix shift. I'm just wondering, if you're able to give us a sense of how far you guys are progressed in moving to APAP versus fixed pressure and how much runway you see in terms of uplift to that number?
Michael Farrell: So, Saul, as you know we don't provide the details of the sort of split by product category code, but we do talk about trends. And so as you see that 35% to 45% go to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55%, you can think that the sort of a baseline of a minimum of one-to-one of what you get out of APAPs from that for new patient setups. And then there is a halo effect, as physicians see the benefits of AutoSet that AutoSet has not only intra-night variability that it monitors breath-by-breath what's going on, it has inter-night variability that people might have more alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night or during flu season might have a high pressure needed to overcome apnea with inflamed upper airway or whatever. And so we are seeing a trend that's ahead of those numbers that you see in the home sleep testing one. But we are not going to break it exactly down for competitive reasons. But it's a positive trend, it has been and it will continue to be for quite a while in the future.
Saul Hadassin: And just to follow-up on the COPD space in U.S., can you give us some color around any easing of restrictions for patients accessing the VPAP for COPD? And just what you're seeing with demand and patient accessibility to that specific device?
Michael Farrell: I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.
David Pendarvis: Yes, Saul, there has been a lot of talk about trying to ease the restrictions for device like a VPAP COPD, so that you can get it to the patients who really need it and it can be just as easy to prescribe as other devices. At the moment, those efforts haven't yielded fruit yet, but it's still an effort that we see that is underway and we'd be optimistic that that device will be more available in the future. Obviously, it plays a good positioning in the marketplace and we've got our life support ventilation device in the U.S. that can fit other codes as well. So we feel like we're pretty well-positioned with an offering in each reimbursement category. And so that if those category shift one way or the other, we are positioned with the right device for the patients, gives them the right care, but we'll also fit the reimbursement category as the payers drive.
Operator: The next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone: Maybe just to begin on the AirSense 10 and to drive into that a little bit. Can you give us a sense first on pricing and how the series compares to prior generations of flow generators, say, the S9? And then, Mick, you shared quite a bit on just the benefits for DME customers and driving essentially savings and efficiency for their businesses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit and maybe quantify how an AirSense 10 is benefiting above and beyond, say, an S9?
Michael Farrell: Yes. I'll hand that question to Jim, who runs our Americas. I might follow-up after.
Jim Hollingshead: So in terms of AirSense 10 and pricing, we're seeing that AirSense 10 pricing is actually holding up very well. The bulk of our growth in the quarter was with AirSense 10, and we think the value proposition is strong and the pricing has held up pretty strongly. In terms of efficiencies -- well, if I just say, the AirSense 10 as a flow gen, just as a product is an outstanding product. When you layer on top of that what we called the health informatics ecosystem and then set a solution that ride on that platform, you're adding extra to just the decision on flow generate that's already a winning flow gen. The way it drives efficiencies for our customers is, as Mick was saying, it takes our cost. For example, somebody has an AirSense 10 and they're using our U-Sleep platform, they are able to manage patients by exception, so they are managing patients based upon their compliance. They are automating to some extent, coaching for compliance. So that's both a revenue generator and a cost cutter. And we published a study, it was actually a randomized control trial a few months ago, that showed that for one of our customers who actually ran an RCT in this space, they were able to increase compliance by 10 points off of the very high standard of care compliance rate from 70 to 80, but they were able to cut their labor cost to 59%. And that's just one of the features in the solution and that's just the solution that's out now. There is a roadmap for solutions that are coming. So in addition to continue to provide just an outstanding product that's comfortable, quiet, easy to fit, easy to set up, we're providing solutions on top of that that are going to increase revenue and save cost for our customers.
Michael Farrell: The only thing I'd add on to that, Anthony, to what Jim said, which is really good comment, is as an addition for the ability to do remote assist, and so our HMEs can remotely, HME customers can remotely access their patients' devices over the web. So they can be on Air Solutions, on AirView specifically and interrogate the capability of a flow generator. So if a patient says, look, I've got a problem and the humidifier is not working, they are able to go online and say, well, actually, look I just did an interrogation on machine and it looks like it is working, but I see the setting is at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. What's your thermostat set on at home? And they can say real-time, well, it's set of 72, and they can say, well, you know what, it's not going to heat if it's set at 70 and the thermostat is 72. Why don't I change that up to 74, and it will heat up tonight. And that conversation, which is two minutes could have been a device driven into an HME. So the patient is upset. The DME sending it back to ResMed's tech service center, our team analyzing and saying no fault found, shipping it back, and then getting it back to the patient. All that inefficiency of the FedEx, the patient time, the RT time, our technician's time, it's all tax, it's all waste. We can eliminate that. It's good for us, as ResMed, allows us to be more efficient. It's good for our customers, our HME providers be more efficient. And most important of all, it's good for the patient, who gets the care, they can stick to the care and they're not without it and they are not upset about it. So those two examples of taking labor cost out and reducing inefficiency in the supply chain are just some of the benefits, the early benefits we're seeing with Air Solutions.
Anthony Petrone: And real quick, just on buyback. Just an update there, where the program is and will you accelerate that, given where the gross margin outlook kind of is at this point and some of the FX headwinds?
Michael Farrell: Brett, you want to take that?
Brett Sandercock: I mean we've been reasonably consistent I think on the buyback, in some years we've buyback more than others. The baseline we look at is certainly to buyback enough to offset the dilution from any issues to employees in terms of equity. That's sort of probably around between 1 million and 1.5 million shares as a baseline. And then, typically we do a little more than that. So we did 667,000 shares this quarter. We will certainly continue to buyback stock and it will just depend on kind of what's happening, and we'll have a baseline that we'll buyback and then kind of somewhat opportunistically a little bit after that, I guess.
Operator: And the next question is from Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott: My first question is just around competitive bidding around three. Just wondering if you could perhaps give your view on how big an event it is for the industry relative to see V2?
Michael Farrell: I will hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.
David Pendarvis: From our perspective in the sleep space and the respiratory space, so sort of excluding oxygen importantly, it's about 30% or so of the Medicare patients who are remaining. So you size the thing on an overall basis, think of the U.S. being 50% of our business and think of Medicare patients who are in the U.S. being roughly 20% to 25% of that. And then you've got of that Medicare population roughly 30% or so remaining in CV3. I think some of the estimates that are out there have broader product offerings from DMEs, including oxygen and other things would be greater than 30%, but from our patient perspective that's how we would size it up. Obviously, the rules that are out there are showing that it's going to phase-in in January 2016 with sort of a blend of half-and-half of the existing rates and half of the average rates from the other regions, and then that phases into a full average once you get to July 1, 2016. So that's where we see it going. There's not a lot of mystery about that. At this point, obviously we work with our customers and our customers have discussions with CMS all the time about, whether they can improve on that and do more in the rural areas, et cetera, for the few details that are left. But from a sizing perspective, it's relatively small size of our overall global business.
Ian Abbott: If I could ask Brett a question, just I'm not sure if I might have missed it, but just touching on the contingent consideration write-back, can you perhaps expand on that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sure. That was in our SG&A, and that was release that we did 12 months ago and that was just impacting the comparable for this year. Something we did at this time last year.
Operator: The next question is from Craig Collie with Macquarie.
Craig Collie: A couple of questions from me. The first on the strong flow gen numbers. So any chance of, I guess, splitting that out between what you think are new patients to I guess sleep therapy, and what the remaining portion, in terms of existing patients, upgrading the old flow generators?
Michael Farrell: Good question, Craig. I'm going to hand that to Jim Hollingshead.
JimHollingshead: It's a great question, Craig. We're not going to guide on that. If we had the data -- we don't have clear data on that to begin with, but if we did we probably wouldn't guide on it.
Craig Collie: Second question on bundling, any updates on whether the pilot started and I guess any detail around that?
David Pendarvis: We don't have a lot of details yet on what that pilot would include other than it's suppose to be six markets on sort of the control arm, if you will, and six markets on the bundled arm. But CMS hasn't come out with the details on that. They were suppose to be able to start anywhere in 2015, and there has been no start and no announcement of when it will start. Obviously, they can delay it or start it whenever they like, but you'd expect them to give the market a good notice. So we're waiting to get the details on what that might look like, but we're prepared to support our customers anyway we might need to.
Craig Collie: And you remain relatively relaxed about that, I guess, given that the fact it's going to be appearing to be no minimum supply requirements?
David Pendarvis: Actually, Craig, we don't know that. We don't know if there will be no requirements or if required two masks a year or one mask a year or how many filters and how many tubing. We actually know nothing about. They haven't given any details. As you know, Craig, we operate in a 100 countries and we operate in many different environments, including where there bundle payments and whether or not. And we sell in some markets through pharmacies, in some markets we work with otherwise to get direct to patients. And what we've found is that in the markets, where bundling has happened we partner with our homecare providers and we've been able to ensure that not only are the homecare provider is taken care of, but really importantly that the patients are able to get access to masks and accessories. And the person that really wants this new mask is a person that's putting it on every night. And if it's difficult in the reimbursement environment to get it, particularly in the U.S., with increasing high deductible health plans and health savings accounts, we're finding a lot of people who are going online to get those types of devices. And so we think that a lot of HME providers, they are establishing those sort of online networks, and we are partnering with them in many different countries in the world. And the good news about the government is it will take a while. They will have to do the pilots and they'll have to get feedback from their constituents, because these are the Medicare beneficiaries, and it will take some time for them to ramp up. It will give us time and Jim's team time to partner with the U.S. homecare providers. And what we'll do is get global earning from Germany and France and many other countries, where we operate in that environment, and make sure that the homecare providers, the patients and the healthcare system is properly taken care of. And we think that can be done quite efficiently.
Operator: The next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne Wuensch: Well, I have a couple of questions. You sounded more optimistic on M&A on this call than you have at any other stage. Is there something that has changed for you?
Michael Farrell: No, Joanne. I just think that as you talk about capital management, you have to talk about the three arms of it. One arm is making sure that we continue the share buyback, as Brett talked about, it's opportunistic, but it's steady. The second arm is obviously our dividends, which we've established a number of years ago and have increased most years, and we announced another $0.28 today from the board. And the third arm is M&A. And I just wanted to make it clear that with $400 million of net cash and access to over $700 million through a syndicate loan facility that we declared recently, we have the dry powder to do that. There is nothing eminent on the radar screen that we can talk about or that's there right now that we should talk about.
Joanne Wuensch: And one of the things that you said, if I heard you correctly, was that there was some M&A or some acquisition revenue in the quarter. I don't remember seeing a press release regarding that. Could you remind me what it was? And what that revenue might've been in terms of dollars?
Michael Farrell: Yes. Thanks Joanne. They are pretty small, and I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about any M&A in the last six to 12 months.
Robert Douglas: Yes, sure. So Joanne, we had previously talked about some small acquisitions of some Australian distributors that we've made over the last few quarters and it also included a small one in New Zealand. But what's happening in those markets is they are unique different markets. And it's quite unusual particularly in Australia, where there is strong reimbursement for getting diagnosed with sleep apnea, but little contribution from government or any public systems even towards any of the treatment. And so it's a unique market, quite differently structured, and we thought that we could help really develop the market there and drive awareness, if we're a little bit closer to some of their customers and patients. So we're just really trying a marketing experiment in those countries and we'll let you know the results, as they become relevant.
Joanne Wuensch: The emails that I am getting so far are questions and you can hear it throughout this whole call about your flow generators. And it's going in two directions. One, wow, can they do 20-something percent next quarter? And two, doesn't masks and accessories follow a strong flow placement? So how would you respond to that?
Michael Farrell: Well, Joanne, as you know, we don't give guidance on a revenue basis and we don't give guidance on the category basis around flow generators. So look, we do think it was an excellent performance clearly from both our Americas team and our Europe and our Asia-Pacific team on the flow generator category, but that's the result of three to five years of amazing product development work from engineering teams in Munich, Singapore, Sydney, San Diego and Halifax. And so that great level of biomedical engineering, software engineering has created a value proposition that the marketplace is finding compelling. And we were surprised at how successful it was in that first quarter, because we thought it would take some time to walk through. Some of these savings take time for the provider and take time for the patient to get, it did come out of the gate strong, and we do think there is a long runway. The value propositions that payback over many, many, not just quarters, but years for our customers and our patients and our homecare providers and suppliers. So we think it goes pretty well along that front. I don't know, if anyone else has got anything to add to that. Jim?
Jim Hollingshead: I think it's actually pretty simple, which is, we are taking share in masks sequentially, we're taking share in flow gen faster, even faster.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. End of Q&A
Michael Farrell: Great. Thanks, Ellen. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches and for their continued commitment to our long-term goals. We remain focused on changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath, and we remain inspired by our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for you time today. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2015 ResMed, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Larissa, and I’ll be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed’s live webcast today. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it could be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today’s investor call as we provide an overview of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 results. I’ll provide an update on our new product launches, some key sales highlights and our progress against our Three Horizons strategy. Then I’ll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. As we promised during our investor call last quarter, the ResMed team has been focused on executing on our strategy of launching new products, new services and new solutions that provide exceptional value to all key players in our value chain. That includes physicians, providers, payers and most importantly patients. We have delivered exciting offerings that begin to fulfill the promise in our core sleep apnea market with the launch of the Air Solutions ecosystem and its key enabling component, the AirSense 10 platform. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter growth and our overall results. We saw strength across our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as solid growth in the Americas. These results are primarily due to the success of our new product launches in both the sleep disorder breathing and our respiratory care markets, which includes COPD as well as neuromuscular diseases. On a constant currency basis, we grew 6% year-over-year for our global business in Q1. We delivered gross margins of 62.4%, which is right near the middle of our guidance range. We have continued to invest SG&A to promote our new product launches. As you’ve seen from our recent press releases, we have launched products across our portfolio, including sleep apnea, sleep wellness and respiratory care. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.58. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was a $0.01 higher at $0.59. In the first quarter, we grew at 11% on a constant currency basis across our combined Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Sales growth came from flow generators associated with our new product launches, as well as masks and accessories. With the launch of the AirSense 10 platform in its early days, we see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac as both the AirSense 10 and our new Astral platforms continue to ramp. In the respiratory care market, our leadership positions and our established channel in Western European countries have allowed us to rapidly grow our business and build good momentum with the launch of our new life-support ventilator, the Astral platform. We expect this momentum to continue solidly in Europe over the coming quarters and fiscal years. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in Asia-Pacific. This quarter we took advantage of opportunities to realign our distribution channels in several Asia-Pac markets, and we have started investing in a dedicated Asia growth initiative with a focus on China and India. We are planning for strong growth from China and India, as well as emerging markets, including Brazil and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2015. Moving on to Americas results, we had a very solid performance this quarter from the region. With the America sales team achieving a 10 percentage point growth turnaround from Q4 to Q1, resulting in 3% growth for the region in Q1 on a year-on-year basis. We are seeing U.S. patient volumes growing in both flow generators and mask categories. We are very pleased with the initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches. I’ll talk first about our sleep apnea category product platform, the AirSense 10, and then I’ll talk about our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. We have received very positive feedback from our customers for AirSense 10, and although it is still early days, our sales are ramping up quickly, exceeding our original expectations. As a result of this excess demand, we ended the quarter with a modest backlog for some categories of AirSense 10 devices in the Americas. We are swiftly accelerating our manufacturing and supply chain, and we believe that we will catch our supply curve up to that growing demand curve during this fiscal quarter Q2. In September, we also announced the launch of our new life-support ventilation platform, the Astral, into our U.S. market. The Astral platform has some of the most advanced engineering that ResMed has produced, delivering key advantages for customers such as lower total cost of ownership for HME providers and increased battery life, which means up to 24 hours of freedom for patients. We have received good feedback from our HME customers and our key opinion leader physicians on the Astral product, and we look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral. Moving back to the sleep apnea market, the ongoing product mix shift from CPAP to APAP continues steadily as home sleep testing continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 40% to 45% of diagnoses in the last 12 months in the U.S. were through home sleep testing. Almost every player in the industry from sleep physicians to HME providers expect that private insurance companies will continue to drive this trend above 50% in the near future and beyond. Looking at the masks and accessories categories, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We gained share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 has continued to be excellent. On a sequential basis, volumes were up, and prices were relatively stable in masks. On a year-over-year basis, we’re still annualizing price changes from earlier this calendar year. As a reminder, we are still expecting price to be a negative factor for year-on-year revenue numbers until the quarter ended March 2015. The anniversary of price adjustments that we made earlier this calendar year. Now, I’d like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our Three Horizons strategy. In our first horizon of growth, we’re driving engineering and innovation with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and its key component, our AirSense 10 platform. We expect our bilevel range of devices, which we will call the AirCurve 10 platform, to launch in the U.S. by the end of this calendar year and then into other key markets globally thereafter. We’re expanding our digital informatics offerings by increasing the connectivity from our Air Solutions ecosystem to the informatics ecosystems of our customers. In September, we announced the integration of Air Solutions with Fairview Health Services and their Epic electronic health record system. This is just one example of ResMed looking to eliminate non-reimbursed costs from the value chain and to provide increased efficiency and profitability for our customers. We continue to look for opportunities to link our technology to streamline healthcare processes and to drive efficiencies for our partners in the channel. Earlier this week, we announced the availability of the ResMed Data Exchange program, enabling even more customers to integrate sleep and respiratory data into their own software systems. We want to liberate the data. Watch this space for further expansion of our healthcare informatics offerings for our partners, including HME providers, physician practices, hospital systems and beyond. At the Medtrade conference in Atlanta earlier this week, we demonstrated a new personalized therapy management tool, which we call myAir. myAir is delivered through web-based applications that can run on both Apple’s iOS and Android platforms. myAir allows sleep apnea patients to see data about their positive airway pressure therapy and to improve their engagement in their own health care. This patient engagement tool could reduce or potentially eliminate non-reimbursed costs for our HME provider partners and could ultimately support better outcomes for their patients. myAir will be commercially available in the U.S. market next week, and then we will release it to other key markets in the future. We continue to believe that ignorance of the impacts of untrained sleep apnea is our major competitor in our first horizon of growth. So we are focusing even more are focusing even more attention on the importance of sleep quality for good health. In this vein, earlier this month, we launched two important sleep awareness initiatives. First, we launched an education- and product-focused campaign called Better Sleep for Women. As part of this campaign, we created a new website that educates women on how to achieve a better night sleep and to provide a forum for women to discuss their sleep issues. Women are 40% of the patients presenting for sleep diagnostics, and they are well over 50% of the decision-makers in the healthcare space for themselves and their families. This is true across healthcare and particularly in the sleep space. Our new AirSense 10 AutoSet for Her product with its unique patented algorithm designed for female SDB respiratory patterns is a key part of this offering. This is not just great marketing. It is also solid science. This product has been very well received in its early weeks on the market. The second initiative we launched is the world’s first non-contact digital help device, which tracks both sleep quality, including light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep, and the bedroom sleeping environment, including temperature and light levels. The product is called the S+ by ResMed. The S+ by ResMed is a combination of a sleep wellness product and a sleep coaching service that delivers personalized sleep strategies to individuals. The S+ has a patented non-contact sleep sensor technology, as well as sophisticated cloud-based algorithms that are backed by solid sleep science. The data can be reviewed on a dedicated ResMed app, which runs on both Apple’s iOS and Android compatible devices. The app itself is a free download from the cloud. The S+ by ResMed sleep wellness device is priced at $149. We’ve made the S+ plus available in the U.S. market in the future at select Apple stores, as well as Bed Bath and Beyond stores, as well as online for U.S. customers at both Amazon and a dedicated site mysplus.com. That is all one word. The S+ has already been reviewed favorably in the Wall Street Journal, in Time magazine and on Fox television. We believe this tool can help engage some of the hundreds of millions of consumers around the world who have sleep issues and who want a sleep wellness tool to help them sleep better. We believe that it will create meaningful conversations about sleep between consumers and their caregivers and loved ones, as well as with expert clinicians and physicians. On the legal front in the first quarter, we reached a settlement with a small Taiwanese manufacturer called APEX. The agreement met our goals to protect our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and showed ResMed’s strong defense of its intellectual property. We will continue to take actions to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment of approximately 8% of our revenues that we make into science and engineering within our global R&D team. We are also making progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion. We have continued to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business where we have had a leading presence in home care ventilation for a number of years. We expect to grow Astral, and it will build on its momentum from Q4 in Europe as government insurers continue to see the value of moving patients from costly hospitals to economic and more patient-friendly treatment in the home. In September, we launched the Astral life support ventilator platform in the U.S. As I outlined before, we have received good initial feedback from customers. Combining our existing VPAP COPD noninvasive ventilation device and our new Astral life support ventilation device, we now offer our HME provider and pulmonary physician customers the opportunity to provide the right treatment at the right time for both COPD, as well as neuromuscular disease patients. On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with double-digit growth this quarter. I traveled to our India national sales team meeting this month, and I’ve got to tell you the energy level was palpable. Our country leader there, [Jito] (ph), and our entire India leadership team have an incredible outlook. Their commitment to real-time expanding the future growth targets during a sales meeting is something that I have not seen in over 14 years at ResMed and 20 years in the healthcare and technology industries. We intend to remain focused on geographic diversification with an emphasis on China and India, as well as emerging markets beyond Asia, including Brazil and Eastern Europe. So that in the future these markets become a material contributor for ResMed’s global growth. Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory disease and other new market opportunities. In terms of current contribution, our cardiology products grew strongly in Europe this quarter. Even though it is now 18 months since enrollment was completed on SERVE-HF, we’re still seeing excitement in this space and good partnerships in patient care between cardiology and pulmonary physicians. In terms of other ongoing clinical trials in heart failure, we are currently enrolling patients for our CAT-HF trial at sites across the United States. We expect to complete CAT-HF soon after the SERVE-HF trial data is first published, which we expect to happen during calendar year 2016. CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, whereas SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity with both studies using ResMed’s proprietary, adaptive servo-ventilation technology. We’ll continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached for both of these important clinical trials. It is worth noting that there continues to be clinical interest in positive airway pressure technology as a tool to help reduce the cost of care for cardiac patients. Dr. Richard Schwab and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center published a study last week in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine showing a reduction in hospital readmission rates for cardiac disease patients with adherence sleep apnea treatment. Reduction of hospital readmission rates costs – helps reduce costs and can help mitigate the reimbursement penalties that hospitals face when Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of a discharge. I talked to a lot of hospital CEOs and CFOs, and they are looking at heart failure and they are looking at COPD patient readmission rates very closely. We know we can help them with technology that includes positive airway pressure and also technology that goes way beyond their future. Finally, on the capital management front, we continue to generate strong cash flow during the quarter, and we have maintained our commitment to return cash to you, our shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which is a 12% increase from our previous dividend. And during the quarter, we repurchased 835,000 shares at a cost of approximately $43 million. We plan to continue with a very strong capital management strategy throughout fiscal year 2015. Let me close with this. The next 12 months will be very exciting for our global ResMed team as we continue to ramp up the launches of the new products that we discussed here as well as others and new services and new solutions across our Three Horizons of growth. We continue to focus on improving patient quality of life, halting the progression of severe chronic diseases and lowering the costs of highly stressed healthcare systems around the world. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials and then to Q&A. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the September quarter was $380.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 6%. At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $207.2 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $173.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $95.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $111.9 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $119 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms also an increase of 15%. Masks and other sales were $54.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter and in constant currency terms a gain in increase of 2%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 12%, while masks and other were flat compared to the prior. Gross margins for the September were 62.4%. On a year -over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 130 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. Looking forward for the full fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we expect to see a minor negative impact on gross margin as the impact from a weaker euro will be largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Finally, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $110.5 million, an increase of 9% over the quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, additional headcount to support commercial activities and an increase in variable, employee compensation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of28.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $30 million, an increase of 10% over prior quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% particularly in 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy. Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.4 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 18.3%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a net tax a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the favorable conclusion of long-running German tax audit. Excluding the impact of this one-time benefit, our effective tax was 21.5%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015, excluding the one time tax benefit will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Net income for the quarter was $83.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 4% over the prior quarter. Excluding the benefit of the one-time tax item noted previously, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.56 consistent with the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations was %86.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $20.7 million and depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.6 million. You will have seen we began including the cash flow statement with our earnings release this quarter. Many of you have mentioned it would be helpful to have that with the release, and we plan to continue to include that going forward. Our share repurchases continue to play a significant role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $835,000 shares for consideration of $42.9 million. At the end of September, we had approximately $17.4 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We do expect to maintain an active share repurchase program during fiscal year 2015. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $506 million and at September 30 total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.7billion. And with that, I’ll hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn the call over to Q&A, and we ask that everyone remember to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew, your line is now unmuted. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.
Margaret Kaczor – William Blair: Good afternoon, guys. So first for us, can you talk a little bit about how quickly the DMEs are responding to the new product features of the AirSense and that connectivity capability? Is it making the sales cycle longer? A little bit more detail there.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Margaret. You know, as we said, the AirSense 10 launch is going very well. It’s exceeding our expectations. We’ve received very positive feedback from our customers. To your question, the discussion around healthcare informatics and its use within the business of the homecare provider is a more detailed conversation and takes a little longer to have that discussion, but we also think it’ that it provides a lo it provides a lot of value to the HME provider. Some of the value to the HME provider can be the fact that with the inbuilt modem, you no longer have to manage a set of SKUs of modems and connect them and manage a fleet of modems all the a fleet of modems all the way through to dealing with customers who have their customers – the patients who have may have problems with devices that can be instantly checked that the humidifier is working, say, from the HME provider to save that cost of $75 to $100 of driving out to see the patient or the customer tax that comes with the customer coming in. So there are just some of the simple ones. They are obviously a lot more advantages as we look at Air Solutions and the value we can provide with the end to end solution and providing value across the value chain. But even those initial discussions with HME providers do provide a great opportunity to get beyond features and benefits and start talking about end to end solutions. I’ll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas. Do you have any further detail on the first months of AirSense 10?
James Hollingshead: Yeah, sure I would you say a couple of things, Margaret. It’s not cycle devices are doing very, very well. The device is a fantastic device. It’s small. It’s quiet. It’s very easy to set up, etcetera. But there is a sales cycle associated with then using the wide and growing range of solutions from a business process flow point of view for our customers. So the device is selling extremely well and we’re in more and more conversations about how they can take our software solutions and embed those into their business process.
Margaret Kaczor – William Blair: Okay. So maybe they are a little bit longer and so that can start to accelerate and take more shares as we go on throughout the year. But the (indiscernible) go ahead, sorry.
James Hollingshead: I just clarified. It’s not taking longer. The devices are selling very well. What then is happening is when then is we are engaged in deeper conversations about using the device to its full effect along with our solutions. So there is some kind associated with that some kind associated with that conversation, and it is almost a solutions consultant conversation that comes on the backend. So the device sales have not slowed down at all. It’s how they apply the solutions into their business that can take some time for them to embed and that part of it is what makes this so sticky.
Margaret Kaczor – William Blair: Got it. And then how much of the growth this quarter beyond the AirSense launch do you think was actually kind of the delayed sales from the man previous quarter that maybe got pushed into this quarter? Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell: Yeah, I don’t think, we have a material breakdown of that. There were some S9 that we sold obviously during quarter, a significant component of the sales S9 devices. The AirSense 10 had a rapid ramp faster than we had expected, and a couple of the SKUs, the categories were on backorder at the end of the quarter. I’m not sure, Brett, if we have a breakdown of any material change from Q4 to Q1 then. Brett, do you want to make any comments there?
Brett A. Sandercock: No, I think that’s right, Mick. It would be hard to really know, if there was an impact what that impact would be. Certainly though when you look at AirSense and how it’s gone the first two months, it’s gone very well. But yes, I don’t think we have tease out that impact.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Margaret.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Thanks very much for taking the question. I’m sorry my phone had dropped out – maybe a bit repetitive. But actually I thought I might ask you quickly just on the launch of the bi-level range, just where you’re at with that. Does that appear in the inventory build and whether you have had any effect in the quarter by not having that product out there?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Andrew, and good that your phone is working now. The bi-level products which we which we are calling the are calling the AirCurve 10, we did show at the Medtrade conference earlier this week in our U.S. market, and we will launch the AirCurve 10 before the end of the calendar year. So they are out there in the public environment. Given the competitive environment, we are not going to give the date or the level of inventory that we have or do not have of AirCurve 10 within our factories or our distribution warehouse. So it just doesn’t make sense to go into that level of detail. But I can tell you, I’ll stand behind what we showed at the conference and what we said at the AirCurve 10 will provide fantastic value. It will be part of the Air Solutions ecosystem, and we look forward to launching it in our U.S. market before the end of the calendar year.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: And I guess last time with the launch with the delays, obviously it was a prolonged delay last time. Don’t you think there’s any small levels of deferral that you’ll experience between now and then?
Michael J. Farrell: You know, Andrew, given that we will be launching the AirCurve 10 within three months of the AirSense 10, we don’t expect any dramatic holdovers on the bi-levels like we had from the S8 to S9 or the S9 to S9 bi-level timings. As you remember, those were more of the order of 24 months and 36 months respectively. So, we are talking three months. Any impact may have happened in Q1 where we had the Airsense 10 products and the CPAPs and APAPs but not the bi-levels. The bi-levels were still on the S9 platform. But we think it’s relatively de-minimums, and we think going forward that the full value proposition we will have by the end of Q2 will be in the market, and we shouldn’t be materially affected by that.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Okay. That’s terrific. Thanks very much, and I’ll get back in queue.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Andrew.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you and your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.
Steve Wheen – JPMorgan: I just had a quick question for Brett on the currency effect on the gross margin for the current quarter. At the last quarter, you highlighted that there might be a small headwind. Are you able to quantify it? And then just talk to what sort of benefit we may have seen from the weakening of dollar and going into subsequent quarters. I take your point about the euro, but just if we could provide (inaudible) on that, relativity (inaudible) that would be useful.
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, sure, Steve. Yes, if you look at our margin sequentially through Q4 to Q1, there was a currency headwind. It was around 50 basis points. So that certainly did impact our gross margin when you looked at it sequentially. If you look forward Q1 to Q2, we certainly have a headwind from the weaker euro, which is impacting revenues and then margin. If you look at that – I think, we that, we get a small headwind, it will probably I suspect be around the 40 basis point marks for that. As you know, the only dollar benefit tends to lag by a quarter or so. So more of that benefit would then flow through into Q3, we are infecting Q3; I think on a sequential basis, we get some more upside from currency because of the weaker Aussie. So that sort of plays out like that
Steve Wheen – JPMorgan: Yeah, that’s very useful. And then just separately a quick question on Japan. Been waiting for some – it has obviously been a market that has been a little bit disruptive over recent quarters. Could you just give some update as to what might be happening there?
Brett A. Sandercock: Rob, our President and Chief Operating Officer will answer that.
Robert Douglas: Yes, thanks, Steve. So the fundamentals of the Japan market haven’t changed dramatically. We still have a good patient flow. We still got a really good business with our cardiology product, and we’re seeing strong product flow there. Because of the structure of the way we go to market, these are lumpy businesses it reflects in our sales. And this quarter we had a positive result from that lumpiness. But we will continue to see that lumpiness through there and we will have positive strong quarters, and that’ll be offset periodically. It’s pretty well going pretty well.
Steve Wheen – JPMorgan: Right, thanks very much.
Brett A. Sandercock: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could just touch on mask sales. So the numbers or the growth rate is relatively weak there and particularly in light of the fact that there’s a number of new products being launched. Could you talk to what’s causing the weakness with that new product range being out?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David. Yeah I will mention three things and then maybe hand Don Darkin, President of our SDB business, to talk after that. First point, we saw volume growth in the quarter sequentially increase, and we expect that to continue as we ramp up. So we saw a sequential increase in volume from Q4 to Q1. Masks were down. Second quarter masks were down in Q1 on a year-on-year basis due to the lower prices that were washing through from the sort of January to March 2014 quarter that will happen January to March 2015 quarter. And so we are still expecting that to wash through on that time horizon. But the third point is we have seen really good traction of the AirFit range from the P10, which I personally wear and have been for a number of months, the N10 and the F10 and the growing share sequentially and the anecdotal feedback from customers is they really like those masks. So I think that augers well for us as we look to future volume growth and then future revenue growth as we look to our end of Q3 and Q4.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thanks. So you would classify that as – not off on share. It is more around price than it is share loss.
Michael J. Farrell: I’d actually say we took share, David, from Q4 to Q1 on a sequential basis and that the year-on-year numbers you are looking at obviously we are watching through the price changes that have happened there. So that’s how I’d nuance that.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Thanks, Mick, and just maybe one for you, Brett, just on gross margins. You talked about there being a negative mix effect in there. Could you just touch on that whether you’re talking geographic or products, please?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, that would be on the product side, Dave, and it’s really that as you saw the kind of flow generator growth relative to the mask growth was the big driver there.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: So would it not be right to say that geographically there was a positive mix effect?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yeah, if you look at year on year, yes, correct. But fairly – pretty small, pretty small.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: All right. That’s all I had. Thanks very much.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning. First question maybe just for Brett. Brett, operating cash flow was actually down on the PCP. Earnings were up slightly. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that was? Is it receivable days that have increased on a PCP basis?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yeah, that would be. Yes, these are around some modest increases in working capital on a relative basis. The receivables DSOs is little higher, and probably the other driver there would be some inventory build as well. So they are playing out with a modest increase in working capital, which has lowered cash flow a little bit. Having said that, I still think the $86.5 million is still pretty strong cash.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Sure. Okay and just a separate question for Mick. Mick, October saw the introduction of the CMS penalties to hospitals with readmission rates, one of them being COPD. Are you starting to have any increased dialogue where engagement with those hospitals with regards to use of bi-levels in particular for management of COPD in the home?
Michael J. Farrell: Saul, that’s a great question and actually leads into something I had in the prepared remarks, but COPD and heart failure together are two of the top readmission disease states for hospitals CEOs and CFOs as they look at this in the U.S. And yes, currently it’s around a 30-day readmission cycle. And the penalties are significant and they go across the whole Medicare CMS reimbursement for that hospital. So this is real money that you’re looking at. You have to be above the million, above the 50% mark for hospitals across the United States to not get a penalty. So it’s a competitive game that gets more competitive as everyone gets better. We are certainly partnering with our hospital customers and our DME providers to make sure there is a strong hospital to home transition for those patients with COPD. The opportunity is twofold. It goes beyond just bilevel. The opportunity is our VPAP COPD, which is the bilevel noninvasive ventilation device and it’s also for the Astral for the Astral, which is a life support ventilation device that can be used for both COPD and neuromuscular disease patients. So there’s a right solution for the right patient at the right time that the hospital and the HME provider can get. And so we are partnering with discharge planners and hospital systems across the country. And frankly in the new world of ACOs, accountable care organizations, where hospitals and primary care now share per member per month budgets, we think the time is right to move we think the time is right to move on this, and we should see progress on this over the coming quarters and fiscal year because this is a long development cycle but again has stickiness as you look to that long term.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one for me, you guys have been very active on the informatics development recently. Can you just remind us how are these initiatives going to translate into revenue for ResMed?
Michael J. Farrell: Well, that’s a great question, David, and I will hand the second part of Don Darkin, the President of our SDB business. But the informatics investment is a major one for us. As you can see with Air Solutions, which comprises both AirView, which is the combination of our EasyCare online, well as U-Sleep, as well as now myAir. You’ve variety of applications that are primarily cloud based and can interface with HME providers, hospitals and also with U-Sleep to coach patients. These are major investments, and the way in which this connects through to revenue is that as for instance take one of the plays in the channel, an HME provider realizes they can save non-reimbursed costs by drive outs, pickups and no-fault balance with devices, they will want to adopt this new technology. And as they see its capabilities on that front, they will realize the value that they value that they get is far above the price that we are charging them for access to data points. And for us, taking weight out of the system and providing investment to get some return from that is also a positive economic argument. So it works for us, and it works for our HME providers. If you take another example the Epic hospital integrations with Fairview, not only is the HME providers that are involved there getting the benefit of reducing non-reimbursed costs, but the hospital system that is looking to manage say the COPD readmits or say their accountable care organization, total economic or total cost of ownership or total patient management approach, they can find both a clinical and economic value out of that And that should for us lead to more share and more stickiness with those hospitals, HME providers, patients throughout the value chain. Don, anything to add beyond that regarding our healthcare informatics investments and any connection to revenue.
Donald Darkin: Yes, David, the broader issue here would be to look at it, like a Kindle. If you think about how people will select the best conditions for whether they are a large HME or a small HME in running too many realizations of revenue from troubleshooting. You want to roll the truck to check if whether unit is working or not. You will be looking at share shift on big customers to who want to get more units into that solution into end. The compliance programs will drive more usage, usage, better outcomes for the patient, better outcomes for the HME. This will also then drive programs for accessories, which will again increase better patient compliance and a better business for the HME. So there’s a multitude of areas here notwithstanding the actual costs coming out of the actual value chain and increasing profitability for the customers as well. And they are all on top of any sort of flat fees that may be paid for purely phone usage either way. So it’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. It will reflect itself in many, many ways, in many, many countries.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Thanks for the answer, guys. Just a quick one on emerging markets for my follow-up. I’m just curious are you planning on selling the same products in emerging markets or you’re going to be launching low cost, low wear cost alternatives?
Michael J. Farrell: David, great question. I’ll hand that to Rob Douglas
Robert Douglas: Thanks, David. So the emerging markets have got quite lot of different dynamics in them. Each one of them is complex as any of the other markets. Some of them are actually high price markets and some of them are lower price markets. And then they’ve got different medical reimbursement schemes and different system. So it is less focused on compliance management than in developed countries. And so in some markets the value of proposition of the telecoms in the device will be different. And so, in a sense really what we’re going to do is go market by market, and configure products that are appropriate for them and we’ve got a platform solution that lets us do that very effectively.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for your questions David.
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA.
Bruce Du – CBA: Hi guys. Just two questions for me. Just to clarify, so in terms of the timing for SERVE-HF, I think you mentioned the initial results would be in calendar year 2016. Has that time table been pulled back a little bit?
Michael J. Farrell: No Bruce. We’ve always say that the final patient the power around the study. It’s an even driven trial so, we don’t know the exact date but the based on the power analysis and the even rate, that we have predicted the formal patient should hit the two year mark from initial setup some time in 2015. Then the primary investigators have to collect the data, analyze the data, create a peer view publication, go through the peer view prices and then get published so that they can present it ACC or HFSA or AHA. And so that process will result in a first publication and presentation sometime in calendar year 2016. I’d like to make the point, that there will be multiple publications that come from this study. And this is just the first publication that we think it will be a seminal one. That’ll come out during calendar year 2016.
Bruce Du – CBA: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just the second one was around the Astral in the US. Could you perhaps give us a bit of color in terms of the degree of I guess understanding and sophistication by DMEs around the product given it is a relatively new product for you? Does that imply a relatively slower ramp up?
Michael J. Farrell: So there will be a slower ramp up of the Astral product in the U.S. market. These of the our European market, because in Europe we played in home life support ventilation for the last seven years. Since our (inaudible) longer than eight years since our acquisition of Saime. In the U.S. market, we are developing our channel with our risk free account managers and interfaces between them in our territory mangers in through our U.S. channel. I can tell you, we’ve been ramping up that team over the last 6 to 12 months. We trained them very well at the America’s sales meeting a couple of months ago and they will be and they will be and are talking to customers on a day-to-day basis already in the market. The customers have used a similar product from competing companies and so there are number of HME providers who are well versed in using home life support ventilation. So the customer education is not the issue and the customer is actually would like other supplies based on our initial conversations and we think that the value we provide with the lower total cost of ownership, increased freedom for patients, increased ease-of-use and increased maintenance and capability of these devices for both the patient and the provider that there’s a very good value proposition. But if you like, there will be a faster ramp-up of the S-curve of penetration in western Europe versus for the United States. Use of the Americas. In Canada and Latin America, the ramp will be faster more home ventilation supported markets there where we’ve been selling products already from our existing portfolio there.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market.
Andrew Hanover – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I had two questions for Brett, but I wanted to start off with the first more strategic one for Mick just as a follow-up to the last question as it relates to the sales force for Astral. And you know do you believe that you have the right size sales force right now, or are you expecting to increase or decrease it?
Michael J. Farrell: So I’ll take the first take the first half of that question, Andrew, and then I’ll hand the second half of it to Jim to talk about the readiness. Our sales teams globally are very ready for Astro and particularly in France, Germany, and the UK all of the Nordics in many countries in Asia, including Japan, are not limited to it. The teams are very well versed in life support ventilation and home ventilation, and we have an existing number one or number two market share in home ventilation in most of western Europe. So I believe the skids are greased for those country markets. Similarly for Canada and Brazil within the Americas. Within the United States, we are ramping up that team as I discussed. Jim, do you want to add any further detail to that ramp-up to answer Andrew’s question.
James Hollingshead: Yes, sure. We’re not starting from scratch just right now. The team has been in place for a while, and we are adding incrementally to it. I think we have the right level of coverage, and I think we’re fine.
Andrew Hanover – BMO Capital Markets: Great. And for Brett, just two quick ones. How much was FX – how much did FX help or hurt EPS this quarter?
Brett A. Sandercock: Actually, Andrew, it was pretty much flat. No actual impact year on year this quarter.
Andrew Hanover – BMO Capital Markets: Great. And then as it relates to flow generators, flow generators were up 12% quarter in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year, they were up 1%. I was just trying to understand how we think about demand for the remainder of the year, and thanks for taking our questions.
Michael J. Farrell: The demand for the rest of the year?
Andrew Hanover – BMO Capital Markets: Trend for the rest of the year, just so we get a good understanding.
Brett A. Sandercock: Well, the trends on that on the flow gens are probably – probably like Mick talk about it, it is not something we give out in any sort of detailed guidance or anything.
Michael J. Farrell: Now, Brett, you’re right. We’re not going to go into detailed guidance on that. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott – Goldman Sachs: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, about Asia. You mentioned you’d in-sourced a number of distribution channels, including in Australia. Just wondering sort of outside Americas, how much do you now distribute directly, and how much is through distributors and where do you see the split moving?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Ian, we have different models in all the different countries we are in, and we adjust it based upon the needs within those countries. So we sell or distribute within 100 countries, and there are very different models in all of them. For the vast majority of our revenues, we partner with home care providers and HME providers such as in the U.S. and France and in markets where there aren’t government reimbursement. In others we have different models that apply. Our goal in all this from a strategic perspective is to think about the best needs for the health care system and the best needs for the patient and the best needs for everyone in the value chain. And what we’re finding is that the solutions that we can bring to the market have applicability in each of those different country areas. And so I think Rob described it really well earlier that we customize our value prop from a platform that’s flexible country by country, region by region, and frankly even within country reimbursement group by reimbursement group.
Ian Abbott – Goldman Sachs: Great. And then if I could perhaps ask about the AirSense 10. Do you have sort of any – I know you’re one step removed, but do you have any sense if it’s driving any upgrades? Are you seeing existing patients actually coming in and asking for the new model, or is it mainly still new patients?
Michael J. Farrell: So, Ian, we don’t have knowledge to that level of granularity to know at the patient level who is getting the new device set up. Certainly within our U.S. environment, the HME providers that have started to order and use the AirSense 10 have been very pleased and delighted with the product. Its ease of setup. It’s small. It’s quiet. It’s all integrated. There’s no SKUs to manage, so we’re seeing great benefit from that. On the patient side, there are a lot of patient benefits about being small and quiet and comfortable and having the ability to seamlessly have their data shared with their doctor so that they don’t have to drive in for doctor visits. I think a particular aspect of patient engagement that’s important is a product that may not have hit much on your radar, but it’s called myAir. It’s a patient engagement solution that allows patients to directly interact with their data. We have a system called HALO, which is an acronym that stands for Hour After Last Off. So when the patient takes off the mask, let’s say, it’s 6:30 AM, by 7:30 AM their data is available in the cloud and then the HME provider, or the doctor, when they turn up at their office, can have those data in virtually real-time. Similarly, if the HME provider and the patient think it makes sense, the patient can go on their own app on myAir and see their own data. And there can be coaching, there can be feedback, and taking away non-reimbursed costs for the HME provider and potentially improving outcomes and certainly reducing costs for the channel within that system. So we think there are so many advantages of the Air Solutions platform for patients that it will be very engaging. But given we are only two months in, it’s hard to really piece out what is channel demand from HME providers, channel demand from physicians who like features such as the AutoSet for Her, which is an algorithm specifically designed for women or features that, as you indicated, our patients may like myAir.
Ian Abbott – Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Ian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA.
David Stanton – CLSA: Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. I wonder if you could give us some more color in terms of the numbers around whether the use of the AirSense 10 versus other products leads to a lower setup in maintenance costs for a U.S. DME and a patient. Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell: David, we have some data that we presented at the American Thoracic Society conference in May this year, and it’s related to the AirSense 10’s automated informatics capability. And it was a presentation about a technology called U-Sleep, which an HME provider can use, and it provides information via email, text or even interactive voice response. So direct voice to patients that coaches them through the sort of 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-day process and beyond to 365 days and beyond them. And those data from that presentation showed that the costs for an HME can be reduced by up to 59%. That’s 59%. And the adherence had a trend to improvement that went from 73% adherence to 83% adherence. And that may not sound like a whole lot, but 10 percentage points improvement of adherence for a payer system that’s managing a portfolio of patients or an HME provider that’s looking at costs in a tough P&L environment for them could be quite a material contributor to the savings of both those groups. And more importantly for the patients themselves, it means they’re going to stick to this therapy, which is going to help them improve their long-term outcomes. So we think in terms of color for the AirSense 10 that the improvements are quantifiable, and our customers will start to see them and quantify them in their own way with their own systems as it rolls out over the coming quarters and months and years.
David Stanton – CLSA: Thank you. That’s very helpful. And I wonder if you’d make a comment in terms of period end discounting, how you characterize the market in recent periods compared to perhaps a year or so ago? Thank you.
Michael J. Farrell: David, thanks for the question. I’ll hand that one to Jim, and I think it’s the end of our Q&A after that.
James Hollingshead: Yeah. David, I would say we haven’t seen anything unusual this quarter, and I think for a long time our sales have been – in the quarter have been sort of backend weighted. But we didn’t see anything substantially different this quarter as we have over the past several periods.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for your questions, David.
David Stanton – CLSA: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark, so I’ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Larissa. I’d like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed teams from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches. Your innovative engineering solutions are changing the game for customers in over 100 countries, helping them improve patient quality of life, helping them reduce the cost burden of chronic disease and helping them improve the delivery of respiratory health care. We remain focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you and we’ll talk to you again in 90 days.
Agnes Lee: So this concludes our first quarter earnings live webcast. If there’s any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Agnes, you may begin.
Agnes Lee: Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed's live earnings webcast. Joining me on the call today is Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. We have also posted an updated investor deck, which may be found on the Events and Presentation section of the company's Investor Relations website. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC. I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to everyone who is joining us today as we provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 results. I'll review the market dynamics, provide an update on product launches and review progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Brett, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. To briefly review the highlights, Q4 revenue was flat on a year-on-year basis and declined 1% excluding currency impacts. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% for the quarter to $0.64. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding amortization of intangibles, was $0.66. Our revenue was lower than anticipated during Q4, primarily due to headwinds in our U.S. sales. This was offset by very strong growth in Europe, particularly, as well as in Asia. Before I discuss our Americas results in more detail, I'd like to emphasize that we believe that our performance in the U.S. will improve over the coming fiscal year, and there are 3 reasons for this. One, the U.S. market structure is stabilizing as we anniversary the second round of competitive bidding with patient referral volume starting to grow. Two, the pricing adjustments that we put in place during Q3 will begin and continue to wash through the comparisons. And three, the change in buying behavior that we saw from some U.S. customers in Q4 to move away from end-of-quarter bulk deals to a more consistent ordering pattern should continue. This latter point is good for us in the medium to long term as it steadies the supply chain for our customers, our suppliers and for our global operations team. However, it clearly had a negative short-term impact that we saw in Q4 in the U.S. numbers. In terms of the factors that we control, our ResMed team will continue to execute on our strategy of launching new products, services and solutions that provide exceptional value for our customers. I remain confident in the more than 4,000-strong ResMed team, our global growth and our ability to execute to our long-term strategy. Okay. Let me drill down into our U.S. sales in 2 categories: first, our flow generator category; and second, our masks and accessories category. We have seen continued stabilization in the underlying market trends with patient referrals and growth in volumes and referrals to diagnostic channels in our flow generator category. However, flow generator and the accompanying mask revenues softened at the end of Q4. There were 2 key reasons for this: one, the change in buying behavior that we noted previously in some large U.S. customers; and two, industry rumors circulated during the quarter regarding a predicted launch of a new ResMed sleep flow generator on July 1. There was actually a particular date that was part of the rumor. Since we are past that date, it was clearly a false rumor. In fact, we're 30 days past it. But nevertheless, it caused some customers to hold off on ordering from ResMed during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past approach to this topic, we have not given a timeline and we do not intend to discuss the details of our plans for our next-generation sleep flow generator platforms. And we are ready -- and when we are ready for full commercial launch, we will issue a press release. And before that, we will talk to our sales team so that they can talk to customers, whether they be physicians, providers or technicians. Looking at the masks and accessories category. Sales were lower in the quarter compared to Q4 2013 due to 3 factors: one, variations in customer-buying behavior, as we just talked about; and two, the continued year-over-year impact of new pricing structures that we introduced during Q3, as we also just talked about; and three, the transition to our new generation of masks, the AirFit series. So as we regain market share and ramp-up on the AirFit series, that is part of the complication. Specifically, we have seen good adoption of our AirFit P10 product in the pillows category since its launch in January. Additionally, we just launched the AirFit N10 and the AirFit F10, respectively, in the nasal and full-face categories during the fourth quarter. So our results for Q4 only include partial quarter sales for those products. We expect that the F10 and the N10 will ramp-up swiftly over the next few quarters, and they have had a very solid start. Physician, HME customer and patient feedback has been excellent on the whole AirFit series: the P10, the N10 and the F10. It's important to note in this mask category that we have a relatively high comparable growth hurdle from Q4 fiscal '13, which was tough to overcome, especially with the brand-new ramp-up of the F10 and the N10. As you may remember from our call last October, we promised to launch 3 new mask systems during the back half of fiscal '14, and we have delivered on that promise. With the global launch now of the AirFit family of masks, ResMed continues to lead in product innovation, particularly in this mask category. We have quieter, lighter, less-obtrusive and easier-to-fit masks than ever before. We expect the mask product categories to perform very well in fiscal '15. On the diagnostics front, we continue to see an increase in home sleep testing, and we expect that trend to continue as sleep labs expand their diagnostic options. North of 60% of sleep labs now offer home sleep testing in addition to polysomnography, and approximately 40% of U.S. diagnoses in the last 12 months were through home sleep testing as insurers and insurance company colleagues continue to drive that trend. Finally, on the Americas. We are seeing strong traction of our healthcare informatics offerings. EasyCare Online continues to expand its reach, and U-Sleep is rapidly increasing its penetration of accounts. U-Sleep's core value proposition is to increase patient adherence while also lowering HME labor costs by up to 60%. In a fast [ph] competitive bidding world, this type of cost reduction and efficiency improvement is a necessity for our home care provider customers. The ability for U-Sleep to text, email and to use interactive voice response, or IVR, has been well received by patients and helps coach them on their treatment journey. The net result is increased adherence, which is good for everyone in the supply chain and the value chain. The bottom line, the improving market conditions, new product flow and informatics solutions should enable us to significantly improve our Americas sales as we move through fiscal year 2015. Moving on now to sales outside of the Americas. Our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were bright spots in the quarter, especially with respiratory care and cardiology sales. Growth in these regions, particularly strong in Europe, partially offset our Americas performance, bringing us to a flat global headline result. The benefit of having around 50% of our revenue outside the U.S., particularly in tough times like this in the U.S., was well exhibited during fiscal year '14 and especially during Q4. We launched the Astral life support ventilator in Europe and Asia during the quarter. Although it is still very early in the life cycle of the life support ventilator, the Astral has demonstrated very good traction during Q4. Astral is ramping up even faster than we expected, and its value proposition in this platform has been presented to physicians, providers and patients across the regions. Customer demand is growing very rapidly, and we are ramping up our operational ability to deal with that increased demand. We are excited about the prospects for this platform in FY '15 globally. Our gross margins came in at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter. We continue to manage the key parts of the P&L that are in our control, including initiatives to lower product costs and COGS and to leverage our global manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Now I'd like to spend some time talking about the progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. We're continuing to innovate in our First Horizon, which is focused on our core sleep-disorder breathing business. During the fourth quarter, we completed a detailed review and then made changes within our commercial and R&D teams to do 2 things: one, to better align those resources and teams with our strategy; and two, to further increase the efficiency of our overall business and SG&A. Brett will go into further details regarding the restructuring charge we took during Q4 as part of those changes. Additionally in our First Horizon, we have been taking actions to enforce our intellectual property throughout the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter specifically, we incurred significant SG&A legal costs as 2 of those cases went to trial. Those efforts also produced some early wins on the legal front. We don't like to be in court. We prefer to be in the design labs and talking to customers, but we like it even less when we believe our competitors are copying our inventions and infringing our intellectual property. When we are in court, we like to have some battle victories, even if they're a smaller part of a larger campaign. These last few weeks have seen 2 victories for ResMed over a small Taipei-based competitor. The first win was in the U.S. in the International Trade Commission, where the ITC ruled that, despite a redesign of its iCH CPAP device, the Taiwanese device manufacturer continued to infringe ResMed's humidification patents. Also in Germany, we won a permanent injunction against the same manufacturer, prohibiting sales of infringing headgear used on 2 of its mask systems. The judgment was entered by the Regional District Court in Munich, is appealable and covers the entire jurisdiction of Germany. In today's more dynamic and competitive market, we're committed to innovating and providing solutions to our customers while improving patient outcomes and reducing costs for global healthcare systems. We invest 7% to 8% of our revenue back into R&D, and we're choosing to defend that innovation in court to ensure that we can continue to have the ability to innovate and, ultimately, make life better for millions and millions of untreated sleep apnea patients. We're also making progress against our Second Horizon of growth, which includes both the respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion opportunities. With the full product launch of our new Life Support Ventilator, Astral, in both Europe and Asia, we executed against that plan during Q4. Also during the fourth quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Astral for the U.S. market, and we are expecting to execute that launch before the end of this calendar year. On the geographic expansion side, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, and we had strong growth this quarter in these geographies, particularly in the countries of Brazil, India and China. We intend to remain focused on geographic expansion to drive growth within these countries and also other important emerging markets. Our Third Horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory and other new market opportunities. SERVE-HF, our 1,325-patient clinical trial in heart failure has now been fully enrolled for 15 months. Our partners in SERVE are focused on event-driven data collection in the clinical trial size. We currently expect the first publication from this study during calendar year 2016. As this is a completely blinded trial, we will not know the results until the first part of the study is released late calendar year 2015. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached. During the quarter, I visited Professor Martin Cowie, who is the Cardiologist, Principal Investigator of SERVE-HF based in London at the Brompton. In summary, the clinical trial appears to be running very smoothly from a logistics perspective, which is a very good sign at this stage of a large clinical trial. Also from Europe on the clinical front, there has been some recent encouraging data on the use of noninvasive ventilation and its impacts on mortality for COPD patients. In this study recently published in Lancet, Dr. Thomas Köhnlein and colleagues found that the long-term use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for patients with hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a substantial improvement in both survival and quality of life. With the use of effective noninvasive ventilation, 1-year mortality was 12%. This compares to 33% in the control group, leading to a relative mortality reduction of 76%. This is quite an astounding result from the largest study of its kind. This augurs well for future growth of our respiratory care business. During the quarter and for the full year, we have continued to generate strong cash flow, and we maintain our commitment to return that cash to shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share, which represents a 12% increase from the previously declared quarterly dividend of $0.25. This is the second consecutive increase since we began paying a dividend in September 2012. In addition, we ended the year having repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $208 million for the year. We plan to continue with a strong capital management campaign for fiscal year 2015. At a broader level for fiscal year 2015, we are expecting to see top line constant currency revenue growth improvements as we continue to drive innovation with the launch of the new products in both our core sleep and our new and emerging respiratory care markets. The sleep disorder breathing markets remain underpenetrated with continued growth in patient volumes. Clearly, short-term market conditions in the U.S. are tough right now, and we will continue to carefully manage our expenses in that geography while appropriately funding our long-term growth initiatives globally. In the U.S. market, we are seeing the annualization of CB2, which is the biggest round of competitive bidding, and this augurs well for ongoing channel stability and patient volume growth in the U.S. In the Europe and Asian regions, patient volume growth has been strong in Q4, and we expect it to remain so throughout fiscal year 2015. Here at ResMed, we lead the industry with innovative product offerings, and we see ample opportunity to drive revenue growth through solid execution of those new product launches. The solutions will bring value to our customers in FY '15. We will reduce costs for broken healthcare systems that badly need our help and also improve the lives and the quality of life for millions and millions of undiagnosed patients of sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and cardiorespiratory disease. We have exciting plans for fiscal year 2015 with new products, services and solutions. In fact, I would say that we have the most-exciting product pipeline that I have seen in the last 14 years here at ResMed and probably in our 25 years of existence. Our team can't wait to bring that value to customers globally. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $415.2 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, revenue decreased by 1%. At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $214.9 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $200.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $99.3 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting continued pricing pressures in a tough prior year comparable. Masks and other sales were $115.6 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter, reflecting very competitive environment. We expect an improvement in our mask trajectory in fiscal year 2015, as our recently launched masks continue to gain traction in the market. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $136 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant-currency terms, an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $64.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, and in constant-currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant-currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other decreased by 4%. Before I move to the P&L commentary, I would like to take a moment to walk you through the charges that were excluded in our non-GAAP earnings per share. We have excluded the impacts of the restructuring charge this quarter and the onetime Sydney University charge in the prior year quarter. As a result, non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $104.8 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter. And non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $92 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, was $0.66 for the quarter. Now on a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.9%, down sequentially from Q3 FY '14. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable foreign currency movements, a favorable geographic mix, and manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. For fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 6%, primarily due to higher legal expenses associated with patent litigation. Excluding these legal expenses, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 3% year-over-year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 27.8%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.8 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter or 3% in constant-currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy. During the quarter, we incurred a restructure charge of $6.3 million, resulting from the reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams, primarily in our Sydney and San Diego locations. The restructure charge included severance payments made to employees. This is a discrete charge, and we've expensed the full amount of $6.3 million in our fourth quarter results. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the tax benefit from the restructure charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rate associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. Excluding the impact of the restructure charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.1%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 will be in the vicinity of 21%. Cash flow from operations was $115.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.5 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.8 million. Our share repurchases continue to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares, a consideration of $40.4 million, and we ended fiscal year 2014 having repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total consideration of $208 million. This represented approximately 3.1% of total shares outstanding. At the end of June, we had approximately 18.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. This represents a 12% increase over our previously declared dividend and demonstrates our commitment to delivering shareholder returns through our capital management program. Indeed, as of fiscal year 2014, we returned 110% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to maintain an active share repurchase program in fiscal year 2015. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $605 million. At June 30, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes.
Agnes Lee: Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm going to assume that you won't [indiscernible] grab the new product. So perhaps, I can just ask the extent to which you think the deferrals impact -- impacted in the quarter in anticipation of that product. And if I can just throw a tricky one in just quickly ask just also the impact of FX on gross margin or masks on -- just what influenced the gross margin increase as well.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll take the first part of the question and, Brett, you'll take the second. Very hard to understand exactly the extent to which the circulating rumors impacted our flow generator sales in the Americas. It was really just in the U.S. and just from a couple of competitors. But it was reasonably broad spread. It wasn't just 1 territory or 2 territories. I know some executives were traveling in the field during the quarter who told me they heard it from every customer, and so it was pretty broad. Understanding the depth of that impact and how it specifically hits our numbers in terms of flow generator growth in Q4 is very hard to say. The good news is that our news from the field is that patient volumes as the channel has stabilized now with the annualization of CB2, that the patient volumes are there. And so, therefore, a missed sale in Q4 should lead to, throughout fiscal '15, as the inventories were quiet and patients continue to come through the channel that we start to get those back. It won't be immediate, but Andrew, I'm sorry, it's just very hard to quantify exactly what the impact of it would be, but it was there. It was probably, slightly material in some aspects in terms of the U.S. sales. Brett, you want to take the second half of the question?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, sure. Andrew, yes, on FX on gross margin, year-on-year, it was in the order of 150 basis points favorable for us. If you looked at it more on a sequential basis, it was a benefit of around 30 basis points for us. And then currencies where they are just on a -- if you look at Q1 like going forward, it would probably have a -- we'll have a headwind of around, probably, 30 to 40 basis points going into Q1. Yes.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And to what extent do you think your AirFit 10 mask sales picked that margin up as well?
Brett A. Sandercock: It's just -- it'd be pretty small, really, Andrew. I mean, they only just came through in the quarter. So really, at the early stages of traction in those new masks. So I think that'll manifest more through FY '15.
Operator: The next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So let's talk about masks in the U.S. And you guys have high market share, obviously, you're a juicy target even with the great new products coming through. This is not a great mask number. What happened there? I mean, because obviously, you're still selling the older mask through the bulk of the quarter, and then the new one is starting to roll out, but what are you seeing competitively there? You mentioned bulk versus kind of regular way, but maybe just give us a little bit more flavor on U.S. masks.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Ben. So, I mean, there are 3 factors that affected U.S. masks. One, is the variations in customer-buying behavior, right? Moving from a bulk order to a throughout the year type of steady behavior, which is tough short-term better in the long term. Two, there's the impact of the Q3 pricing reductions that we put in place, so they'll need to roll through the comparisons over a 12-month period of time in terms of the pricing impact. And three, there's the impact of the transition to our new masks. We've just launched the N10 in the nasal space and the F10 in the full-face space, literally during the quarter, so you only got a half-quarter of sales or so from those 2 products in the category. So they're the 3 major effects. You mentioned the fourth effect, which is there in terms of the competitive dynamic. And there are some reasonable masks from our competitors. They're not as good as ours, but we do compete out there, and it's a tough market at times, but we think that with the product portfolio that we've just launched, this AirFit series that over FY '15, we have very strong possibilities for not only maintaining but growing share and rising with the market there.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I guess I'll stick to one follow-up and just ask directly, did pricing get worse in the fourth quarter versus third quarter? Or was it the same? And do you think you gained or lost share in masks in the fourth quarter in the U.S.?
Michael J. Farrell: Well, that was technically 2 follow-up questions, Ben. But I think that the price changes that we put into place in Q3 were reasonably effective and, probably, just went broader to more customers during Q4 so relatively stable on the price side from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, on a year-on-year basis, there was a significant price relief for our customers that, of course, we don't quantify now on these calls. To your question about market share, it's very hard by each category to get the details of market share in categories. What I can say is that it's early in the ramp curve of the N10 and F10, so my conjecture would be that the N10 and F10 have a lot more runway to get market share over FY '15. And that if there's any market share gain in Q4, it would have been in the pillows category. If there were any stresses, it would have been in the nasal and full-face category. But that's sort of just based on the timing of those product launches and where they are. And thanks for the 3 questions, Ben.
Operator: Our next question is from David Low from Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Mick, could I just start with the [indiscernible], just get you to perhaps talk to us about change. Then, I guess, the question that comes out of that is if you've seen a hit in Q4, presumably, we start to see a benefit, particularly in the first quarter when things are typically a little weaker.
Michael J. Farrell: David, you were a little light at the start of that question. Could you repeat the whole question? I couldn't quite hear you.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Let me try again. So the change in buying patterns that you talked about with major customers, I just want to understand what changed, and then, therefore, what the impact's going to be in the future. Most notably, it seems to me that Q4 is the strong quarter when there is a lot of deals done towards the end of the period. So presumably, we see some benefit from this changed pattern, particularly in Q1. Is that reasonable?
Michael J. Farrell: So good question, David, so more granularity on the changing buyer behavior. So what we're referring to is that, sometimes, during the quarters, whether it's Q1, Q2 or Q3, but particularly in Q4, there are larger bulk purchases by, usually, larger customers towards the end of the quarter. And we saw those throughout fiscal year '14, Q1, 2 and 3 but not in Q4. And I mean, the difference between missing or hitting on the U.S. sales could be 3 or 4 deals to sort of make up that difference. And if you think about 4 deals of in that sort of $3 million to $5 million range, you can start to see those types of numbers adding up. The question of why those deals didn't happen in Q4 and why the customers are choosing probably to have a lower inventory stake or a more-efficient operation, I think the answer is that they've all faced the reality now of 12 months of -- in particularly in the U.S. market, 12 months of competitive bidding round 2 impact. And everybody in the space is looking for efficiency, for supply chain efficiency, for ordering efficiency and for making sure that their -- that operations are delivered to patients, but they don't have excess inventory. So I think it was part of that, and it came to a head in Q4. I don't think the wash-through is a 90-day wash-through. I think the wash-through on an inventory supply chain, when you start to look at it as more a 365-day timeframe. It's total conjecture because I don't know the details of the operations of the 5,000 customers in the U.S. or even the top 50 to that great level of detail. But my conversations with top customers in the U.S. are that they're looking for operational efficiency. They're looking to take costs out. For instance, that's why U-Sleep has been so popular not only in Q4 but throughout the whole year because people say if I can increase adherence by 10 percentage points and take labor costs out by 60%, that's the technology I need. So I'll start using then: EDI technologies, just-in-time delivery, dropships to patients. All these types of things are being used by our customers. So there -- that's sort of the summary of that 50,000 feet of changes in buying behavior. And I just don't have the granularity on a 10-, 45-, 90-day scale, but my best guess is that it's a 365-day sort of adjustment that you'd have if you're running a large business on that front.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just one follow-up then. Brett, the legal cost looks to me like sort of close to $4 million based on the comments you made about growth in SG&A. What should we expect going forward? Are we going to see further legal costs of that magnitude in Q1, Q2? Or is it going to come down?
Brett A. Sandercock: I mean, to some extent, it depends on timing of court cases, trials and so on. I mean, there'll be -- you can expect there'll be some continuation of litigation costs through FY '15. I mean, the main thing is we're committed to protecting our patents in the marketplace and our innovation. So we'll continue to do that. And if that means we spend some money on litigation from time to time, then we'll certainly do that. There'll be some come through. It was -- this quarter, we did have a court case, which was kind of happening in that quarter, so it probably popped it a little bit. You could expect some base litigation, I think, will continue for next few quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Saul Hadassin from Crédit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a quick question on U-Sleep if I could. There's been some discussion more recently about the compatibility of some of the other manufactured devices across that platform. Can you just clarify, Mick, whether all manufactured products are still compatible with the U-Sleep product?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So I think the question is whether U-Sleep is compatible with all manufacturers' products, and the answer is yes. The technology is perfectly capable of taking data from all manufacturers who are able to get data to the cloud that can interface with an API that can be accepted by our product, which is all the major manufacturers' capabilities. So U-Sleep is perfectly technically capable.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. Just a follow-up. So you published that study quite recently, the abstract about the labor cost base. Can you talk to how effective that's been in terms of driving some higher U-Sleep subscriptions?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Look, without going -- because we don't go into detail of individual customers, but what I can tell you is that, that presentation at the American Thoracic Society from the main stage and then some posters and some follow-up with customers created some great buzz amongst key opinion leader physicians because they see that the world of telemedicine is coming. Digitized data is here to stay, and that efficiency is needed for our global healthcare system. So the key opinion leaders are on board. Specifically, as we talk to customers, particularly in the U.S. with all the price pressures they've had, particularly from CMS, they're really looking, as I said earlier, for efficiency tools. And the data in that study were 59% reduction in total labor costs. And if you're running your P&L and you look at what that reduction on that line is, even if you halve it, say, that was a clinical study, in practice, I'm only going to get half of that. It's a huge potential cost savings for customers. So what we've seen is a lot of customers asking about it. Our territory managers and our corporate account managers are talking to customers about it every day, and we're seeing good uptake from those customers who are doing pilots and trials. Obviously, it's sort of an S curve of penetration for anything, whether it's a mask, a software product or a new platform. But a software platform, when it goes, it can go pretty fast because it's very scalable and it's digital, and that's how it's designed. We're very excited. It's early days, but we're very excited about U-Sleep and the value it can bring to our channel, particularly the providers but also the patients. Patients just love being coached and engaged on their therapy. And moving adherence from 73% to 83%, as was shown in that study, may not sound like much, 10 percentage points, but for 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10, that's a big needle move when you look at what pharmaceutical compliance rates are in the 50s and 60s at best with all the coaching materials they had. The difference is that we have electromechanical device that we can send data to the cloud, and we can coach that patient on what actually happened not whether we think they took the pill or opened the cap. So we're pretty excited about U-Sleep and its penetration, and we can give updates as we go through FY '15.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Fong from Bank of America.
Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mick, can I ask for an update on the Japanese market? And as my follow-up, can I confirm whether you are assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '14 as was in FY -- sorry, FY '15 as was in FY '14 in respect of your gross margin guidance?
Michael J. Farrell: Sure. Rob, do you want to take the question on Japan, maybe both the questions. Rob?
Robert Douglas: Sure. The -- in Japan, as we've constantly said, Japan does stay a lumpy market given the business structure of our few customers there. This quarter, we had a pretty good run at it, and the business goes there. And Japan remains a very, very good market for us with good patient reimbursement and a good opportunity because we think we can still get a lot more patients in that market. In particular, our cardiology products continue to do very well there. Sorry, Eric, your second question on pricing, could you repeat what you said?
Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It was on gross margin guidance. So are you assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '15 as was in FY '14, the guidance of 61% to 63%?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Maybe I can take that, Eric. On the gross margin, yes, I mean, we're guiding 61% to 63%. If you look at the price and if you look at it year-on-year, certainly, with the pricing or some of the adjustments we've made in Q3 that'll wash through Q4, and you're seeing that year-on-year impact, that year-on-year impact that will still be with us through, if you like, the first half Q1, Q2. So we'll still see those year-on-year price declines if you like. And then -- but when you look at the second half and a lot of that would sort of anniversary in terms of some of those adjustments. So now we're not going to make any predictions on where pricing might head that far into the future. But think of it at that first half, we got a wash-through. Second half might be kind of more normal with the caveat that, that's going to be unpredictable, really.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.
Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to get you to clarify that restructuring charge of $6.3 million, where that fits and whether or not there's any likelihood of ongoing restructuring charges going into fiscal '15.
Michael J. Farrell: Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Steven, by where that fits, what do you mean [indiscernible] ?
Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So what sort of -- just where -- what line item would we be looking up if we were trying to normalize that.
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, so it would be -- it's a combination around SG&A and R&D, probably a little more skewed on the SG&A side for that if you're thinking about that. And at the moment, I mean, it's important for us to keep looking at making sure we're doing things as efficiently as we can. It's important for us to make sure our resource allocation is really focused on achieving strategic objectives. So we'll do that. But at this -- right at the moment, we've not -- there's no plans on the table for further restructuring. But we need -- yes, we need to continue to make sure we're operating the business as efficiently as we can.
Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, okay. And just back to that comment on Japan, Rob, if -- there was some issue with one particular distributor that had sort of slowed down quite significantly. Have you got any update on the way they're seeing that market and whether or not they're sort of back to sort of full run rate?
Robert Douglas: Yes. Look, Steve, we don't really want to break out customer by customer data, and Japan's interesting because there's only a few of them as we said. But pretty well, I'd stick with what I was saying, that the underlying business remains pretty strong. We had talked to some issues around -- similar with other markets around inventory policies and stuff like that, but we think that the business will go forward on a pretty steady basis. And the patient flow's really solid there, so that creates the underlying demand for the products.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Smith from Citigroup.
Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You mentioned in the U.S., the patient volumes are there. Can you give us an estimate of what you think's going on at the market level in terms of market growth rates in terms of volume?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Alex. I'll hand that question to Jim.
James Hollingshead: Yes. Alex, we think that patient growth rates are about in line with where they've been. We haven't seen a big dropoff in patient diagnostics in any way. We don't actually name the percentage growth rate on this call anymore. We stopped doing that a couple of quarters ago, but we haven't seen any measurable decline in patient volumes in the U.S.
Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, so really, the dynamics you're seeing are around price and share. You're not really seeing a huge change to underlying demand.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, it's the flow-through of the Q3 price changes. It's the changing in the buying behaviors of customers from more bulk to more steady and some of the channel changes that have happened throughout competitive bidding round 2 that have impacted, all together, those 3 factors have impacted the U.S. growth results there in Q4.
Operator: Our next question is from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Two questions really. One is you talk about revenue next year being greater than this year. Could you ballpark what greater means? And then my second question is CMS has introduced a pilot program for bundling products. Could you please comment on that?
Michael J. Farrell: Sure. Thanks, Joanne. I'll take the first part, and then Dave Pendarvis can take the second part regarding CMS. Yes, Joanne, we don't give guidance with regard to revenue. We are going to improve. Globally, we're going to improve in the Americas for FY '15 because the macro conditions are going to get better. CB2 is done, which is the largest round of competitive bidding. We're going to wash through the pricing changes from Q3. We're going to work with customers to take waste out, including moving from more bulk to more day-to-day sales as best we can, and we're going to manage that volatility. So with all of that, we know the needle is going to normalize, and we're going to move the needle in the right direction. Dave, you want to take the second part of the question, which is with regard to the CMS pilots that they're looking at?
David Pendarvis: Sure, Mick. Yes, thanks, Joanne. The -- it's a little hard to tell at the moment. What we've got is a proposed rule from CMS, which hasn't become a final rule. And the proposed rule itself is proposing pilots in about, I think, it's 16 markets as part of competitive bidding 3. Of course, the timing of the third round of competitive bidding is itself part of a proposed rule. It's not final yet, but assuming all these things go through, it would be sometime in 2016 that they would start piloting in some of the CB3 regions of some form of bundling. We don't know what form that'll take. And depending upon how it goes, we'll, obviously, react to it and help our customers operate with that kind of a model. So it's long ways off, remains to be seen how the final rules come out and then how the pilots come out. But we're familiar with bundling as it operates in different markets throughout the world. So we're confident that we'll be able to work with our customers and work through it as it gets rolled out and look forward to the pilots.
Operator: The next question is from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So the first one I just want to see, is there any way to quantify the change in buying behavior on the U.S. flow gen and mask results? And then if I'm hearing you right, you think that this will take a year to normalize?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So David, difficult to quantify the exact one, and you're going to need a handful of customers to talk about changing a $3 million to $5 million end of quarter buying to others to have an impact. So we don't -- my answer to the question of how long it will take to wash through that changing in buying behavior, I don't know if it will be a rapid deployment of their sort of efficiency approaches and they can get it done in a 90-, 180-day period, or if it'll be a little bit beyond that. The 365 is the absolute outlier, right, because then it's annualized. It has to be less than that. The answer is we just don't know. It's -- how long is a piece of string on that? So you're asking me to quantify something that I -- it's dependent upon the psychology of the customer, and it's very hard to go. What we're doing with our U.S. customers is partnering with them across the board. Solutions like U-Sleep that we talked about to bring efficiency, products like Astral. When we launched this life support ventilator, which is the first life support ventilator we've ever launched in the U.S. market, during this calendar year, we're going to be bringing to them choice. The first time they've had choice in life support ventilation, and they're screaming for it. And we can't wait to bring that for them. And so we think that will bring some faster orders and maybe some upfront stocking orders as they need to stock, to train their staff and get them up to speed on a great life support ventilator. So there's so many factors, including the new masks and how quickly they roll up and what inventory's needed on those, but understanding the exact inventory policies of even the top 10, 50, 100 customers, let alone, the 5,000 in the U.S., is very difficult. So that's why, David, getting a specific quantification of the days of inventory rolled through on average across the customer base is just very difficult. I was sort of giving you the guardrails between 90 and 360. The answer is I don't know exactly where it'll be within that.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up here, the reorganization, so what exactly did this entail? Why are you doing it now? And will there be any kind of disruption?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Jim, you want to take that?
James Hollingshead: Yes. Well, I can speak to the Americas reorganization. Really, the way to think about what we did in the Americas was to align with the strategy. And so without getting into great detail, we made some changes and some additions to the sales force in preparation for the launch of Astral. And then we made some changes to align across some business aisles [ph]. So we've done some things to better align the marketing organization and also to create better alignment between sales and marketing. So it was, obviously, a lot of, if you will, effectiveness moves and alignment with strategy there. In doing that, we also took the opportunity to look for efficiencies.
Michael J. Farrell: Don Darkin, do you -- Don, do you want to talk a little bit to some of R&D restructuring that we did and how that positions us for the future?
Donald Darkin: Yes, so we basically just shifted a few people around to really try and reshape the organization for some of the approaches we're moving into going forward. So apart from some minor reductions in some areas, we've -- we're reshaping and creating some new areas for targeting going forward.
Michael J. Farrell: So I mean, look, David, in net, we're talking less than 1% to 2% or around 1% to 2% of our global workforce here, not a huge amount. But it was important for us to refocus our team towards the strategy and to where we need to be in 2015 and towards our Three Horizons growth strategy. And so it was really around aligning our SG&A and aligning our R&D around those long-term strategies and making sure the long-term bets are all accounted for, and some short-term efficiencies can be gained where we no longer need to expand assets and resources.
Operator: Our next question is from Bruce Du from CBA.
Bruce Du - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division: I just had a question around pricing. I guess it's more specifically to masks. You mentioned that you haven't really seen sort of a change from Q3 to Q4, but you're offering the sort of broader -- discounts more broadly. What are you seeing with regard to the pricing behavior of your competitors in 4Q? Have they changed much at all from Q3 to Q4? And do you anticipate yourselves potentially having to move again? Or has it been relatively stable?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Look, I think some of the competitive moves were more in Q1 and Q2 from our major competitors in the U.S. market associated around competitive bidding round 2. And our moves in Q3 were a response to maintain our appropriate premium over our competitors in that space, and so it was steady. Predicting what's going to happen in FY '15, I will predict there will be some price competition, but what I predict is when we launch our Astral product, which is the second of its kind, right, it'll be 1 of only 2 players in that market that price will not be the issue. It'll be about efficiency, long-term cost of ownership, the value and efficiency for the customer and the value to the patient of that life support ventilator. In our new masks, where you're able to get first-time fit and easier to fit and easy to use, those values become very important when you're looking at the full P&L of managing your HME business. So price is there, will always be there. Our job and job of our R&D teams, the job of our marketing teams is to produce and then position and then provide through the sales team that value to customers so that they can get the efficiency. And we're going to do that throughout FY '15.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I had a question around your -- on the balance sheet. The days sales outstanding seems to have gone up again, and I was perhaps a little bit surprised to see that go up given you've talked about some -- in absence of sort of end-of-quarter sales. So I just wonder if you can reconcile that for me.
Michael J. Farrell: Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Ian, that's, I mean, in particular in the U.S., there's some longer payment terms, I think, that are out in the market nowadays, really, on competitive response from us. And you'll see -- and obviously, that sort of doesn't manifest straight away but will build up over time. So you're seeing a little bit of that coming through in the days sales outstanding but not really -- it's kind of not really a factor or relation to some of the ordering cycles. It's really something that was put in place a while ago that then starts to manifest in days sales outstanding.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up, could I ask around some of the higher-end products? I'm not sure if you mentioned on the call whether the shift just from CPAP to APAP is still ongoing and also some of the high-end products in the bilevel segment, just how they've performed during the quarter and what the outlook for those is.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So we alluded to it a little in the prepared remarks. Ian, you're the first question on it. But the home sleep testing is now at 40% when you look at a trailing 12-month period of all U.S. diagnoses, 60% being polysomnography. It's being driven by the insurers and specialty benefits managers and others associated with insurance companies driving that switch, and the channel is responding. When home sleep testing increases, it does almost directly impact the shift that is continuing between CPAP to APAP. And so we're continuing to see the APAP category increasing, and that did continue during the quarter. We didn't see any big major changes in Q4 for bilevel, pretty steady as a sort of -- as a percentage of total sales through there. The impact on all of them was the changing in buying behavior, the pricing and all the macro effects impact across all those segments. But within the individual CPAP versus APAP categories, we are seeing a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP continuing, bilevels being steady. And as we launch the Astral life support ventilator, we will open up a brand-new category for us at the really highest end of the spectrum in terms of value and margin and value all the way through to the COPD patient, the neuromuscular disease patient that it might treat.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just a little bit, Mick, on the DME ordering patterns. Is there any, maybe, clarity you can give around all those long-term supply agreements where they've committed to purchase commitments? Or are they just in a position now where they're ordering based on their needs? And then one quick follow-up.
Michael J. Farrell: All right. I'll hand that to Jim regarding U.S. DME purchasing patterns.
James Hollingshead: Yes. I'd -- thanks, Anthony, for the question. This is going to sound like a bit of a cliché, but every customer is different. And so what we're seeing is a wide range of behaviors. We've got customers who are getting more aggressive about managing their own inventory balances. We have a wide range of different types of agreements. And so it's actually very difficult to characterize in the context and the way you framed it. But I think we can say that we did see, at the end of the quarter, a change in behavior with some of our customers in -- being more reluctant to do larger deals. And I do think that, that is hand-in-hand with some of the anticipation that's out in the market based on the rumor that was spread by one of our competitors that we were launching a product platform imminently. So those 2 things were connected. But it's very, very difficult to say because of the variety of behavior across the customer base.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for Mick. Is -- previously you spoke on consolidation within the U.S. of DMEs, and that number was sort of in -- close to 8,000 and coming down a bit. You characterized that number lower. So I'm just wondering are we mostly kind of complete with consolidation in your view. Or is there still a little bit more to go?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Anthony, it's a good question, and it's hard to know the exact answer to it. I mean, we sold to more than 5,000 customers during Q4 just in the U.S. As Rob was talking to earlier, I can count on my right hand, less -- half of it the number of Japanese customers. And so yes, it's north of 5,000. Will there be more consolidation? I will expect some further mergers and acquisitions activity within the DME channel. I think quite a lot of it was pre-CB2 and during CB2. I think now it's almost the survival of the fittest. Those who have got through this year and have still got their cash flow and still got operating businesses and good relationships with referring doctors and good relationships with the patients who are members of their sort of portfolio, that they have the opportunity continue to do that. We're going to partner with all our customers: the small, the mom and pop, the medium regionals, the large regionals and the nationals. And we are helping all of them with efficiency. A lot of the tools we provide, such as U-Sleep, can apply to a customer across that spectrum. So we don't have to be a large customer to use it. Some of the others have sort of electronic data interchange and interfacing with their billing capability. We can do with -- through partnerships with some of the small guys and directly with some of the larger ones. So whatever the opportunity to bring value to all those segments of customers, we're looking at doing it. But to answer your question directly, do we expect further consolidation? Yes. Do we think it'll be dramatic? Probably not. Probably an ongoing quarter-by-quarter consolidation of them without a major step-change.
Operator: We are now at the 1-hour mark. I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.
Michael J. Farrell: Well, great. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed employees, who sometimes listen to this call, around the world, for their contribution to the world-leading respiratory medical inventions that position us for the future. And we're going to continue to execute against our Three Horizons growth, and we're very excited about the product pipeline that you guys have developed and we get to launch during fiscal year '15. Our global team continues to be more than ever focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Agnes?
Agnes Lee: Yes. This concludes our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Live Webcast. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast replay will be available on our website at investor.resmed.com. Thank you, again, for joining us today. You may disconnect.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-04-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2014 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company’s products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in ResMed’s SEC filings, which are available on the company’s website. Please limit your questions to two at any one time. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.
Mick Farrell: Great. Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I’ll review the highlights of our fiscal Q3 and then I’ll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail. So, first, the financial summary. Global revenue in the third quarter of fiscal ‘14 grew 4% year-on-year to $398 million. That is up 3% on a constant currency basis. America’s revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis at $216 million. Europe, Asia and rest of world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $182 million, which is 6% growth in constant currency terms. Net income for the quarter increased 6% to $90 million. GAAP EPS increased by 9% to $0.63 per share for the quarter, while hybrid earnings per share which excludes the amortization of intangibles was $0.64 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from our global team. Now, let me review the operating results in a little more detail. We look at our sales performance in the Americas in the context of year-on-year, as well as sequential quarterly results. Last year in Q3 of fiscal ‘13, we grew Americas revenue by 13%. Given this tough comparable and challenging market conditions in the U.S., keeping our topline flat on a year-over-year basis was a good result. Also, I’d like to note that we grew the Americas revenue sequentially by 5% or around $9 million from Q2 to Q3. By category, in the Americas, revenue from masks grew by 2%. Flow generators declined by 2% year-over-year. We were up against very tough prior comparisons in the flow generator category, which grew at 21% during Q3 of last fiscal year. It’s important to note that both of these categories on a sequential basis were an uptick from Q2 to Q3. U.S. market dynamics began to improve in Q3, although the environment is still evolving. New patient growth while still subdued is continuing and importantly, resupply to the installed base of patients is also growing. We continue to promote resupply and a nationwide research study we commissioned recently confirmed that resupply programs work. They provide better care for the patient and better results for the homecare provider and better outcomes for the payer. Our customers are also beginning to see stability in their businesses. As they adjust to the U.S. reimbursement changes from competitive bidding that went into effect in July last year for Medicaid patients in CB2. Many customers are growing back to -- getting back to growing patient volumes. These leading indicators tell us that the U.S. market is starting to stabilize. In January, just 90 days ago, in our Q2 call, we said that, we were going to adjust our pricing in response to competitive activity, particularly in the U.S. market and that played out during the quarter. We regained share during the quarter, although pricing adjustments were an offset to those volume gains, resulting in a flat quarter in revenue terms for the Americas. The U.S. market remains a highly competitive dynamic and going forward, we are going to make sure we are appropriately positioned for revenue growth as the competitive environment develops. We’ll continue to use our innovation and our value propositions across the categories, including products, services and solutions to shape the variables that drive product preference and purchasing decisions. Our sales results for combined Europe and Asia-Pac and rest of world were led by constant currency growth in the mask category of 14%. The flow generator category across Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world was 2%. We see upside for growth in this flow generator category going forward, with the launch of our respiratory care platform in these regions. And I’ll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. Europe delivered another quarter of very solid revenue growth in Q3 as it did in Q2. Our wholesale businesses did particularly well in major markets France, Germany and the U.K., as well as across our European dealer network, which includes the emerging Eastern European acquisitions that we talked about last quarter Poland and the Czech Republic. Our teams in Europe are well-positioned for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We remained on track with our previously announced product introduction plans. We launched the AirFit P10 as promised during the last quarter and that product is selling very well in the U.S. It is just launching as we speak into Europe and Asia-Pacific. During our last conference call, we promised to deliver two additional new masks to the market this fiscal year. We delivered on that promise this week, with the launch of two more AirFit branded mask offerings. The first, the AirFit F10, where F stands for full-face is the lightest full-face mask on the market. The AirFit N10, where N stands for nasal mask, is a new patient-preferred nasal mask that is highly unobtrusive and allows patients to have clear line of sight. These products deliver what patients want most, a light, comfortable, unobtrusive mask that is easy to use. Our pre-launch testing demonstrated that patients prefer these new mask offerings to those currently on the market and we expect physicians and providers will like them too. We’re launching both of these new masks during Q1 -- during Q4 in the U.S. and most other geographies and we will continue the launch throughout Q1 in fiscal ‘15. In the flow generator category, we’re delivering on our commitment as we said and are moving forward to full commercial launch for our new respiratory care platform, the Astral. The Astral is a new life support ventilation system that has competitive advantages in size and weight and it’s being very well received by patients and providers during the controlled product launch that we’ve been conducting in Europe during Q3. This product solution will enrich life for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and neuromuscular disease. We are now ready to move to full commercial launch this quarter in most of our European and Asia-Pacific markets. We already have a strong homecare ventilation presence in these regions with a channel that’s ready to go and the Astral will complement our existing respiratory care product offerings. We are in process for FDA clearance. Our 510(k) is submitted in the U.S. and we hope to launch in the U.S. later this calendar year. The hard work of our research and development teams is bearing fruit this quarter, with the multiple product launches across the globe running on schedule. And the strength of our design capability was recently validated when both the Astral and the AirFit P10 were awarded Red Dot Design awards. This is a global prestigious international product design competition, in fact, the largest design competition in the world and these two awards join our award from a few years ago. I think it was 2010 when we received the Red Dot for the S9 platform. Our clinical research continues to demonstrate the wide-ranging impact of sleep-disordered breathing on a variety of chronic conditions. I want to highlight three recent publications in this space before we go to Brett and then Q&A. First, on the clinical development front, there have been several recent studies suggesting intriguing links between sleep-disordered breathing and cancer. A pair of studies from 2012 and 2013 suggested an association between sleep apnea and increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality. Here in 2014 already, just earlier this month, Dr. Sina Gharib and his colleagues published a study in sleep, concluding that effective therapy of OSA with CPAP is associated with alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression. They suggested potential novel mechanisms linking OSA with cancer-related pathways. It’s too early to understand the workings of the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cancer malignancy or the interactions of CPAP therapy with cancer progression definitively. However, these early investigations confirm the systemic impact of sleep-disordered breathing and the potential benefits offered by our therapies to patients in this category. Second, in a more commercially-oriented study, Dr. Julian Guest and his colleagues are publishing a study in May and it’s already online in the journal Diabetes Care. They are reporting on a resident-sponsored U.K. based study on a cost and outcomes data over a five-year period, treating patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant obstructive sleep apnea. This study concluded that initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with type 2 diabetes leads to significantly lower blood pressure and better control over the diabetes and it affords a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. So it improved outcomes and at better costs. Third and on the healthcare informatics front, the upcoming American Thoracic Society or ATS 2014 meeting, which will be here in San Diego next month, will feature a presentation demonstrating that our U-Sleep automated adherence and compliance program achieved positive patient outcomes with significant reductions in labor. The abstract of this presentation is already available online on the ATS website, so it’s in the public domain and it shows that in a randomized trial, with one group receiving standard care, another group receiving standard care plus help with our adherence system called U-Sleep. The U-Sleep cohort achieved 83% adherence, whereas the standard care group achieved 73% adherence. The U-Sleep system also produced a 59% reduction in labor, that’s 5-9, 59% reduction in labor for those improved outcomes. This is a validated example of the solutions we bring to our customers to promote not only superior patient outcomes, but also improved customer efficiency and thinking about both the healthcare clinical outcomes and the healthcare economics of the channel. So, finally in conclusion, we remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain under-penetrated and our patient solutions provide symptomatic relief for those on therapy, while slowing the progression of important chronic diseases, while additionally saving money for the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions. We have the right people. We have the right approach to succeed. We’re confident that we will continue to do so. So, now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $397.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 3%. Income from operations for the quarter was $104.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the March quarter was 63.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to Q3 FY13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeting at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4%, compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in a diverse product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.3% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.4%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $216.1 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $181.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 2%. Masks and other sales were $62.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1% while masks and other increased by 6%. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.2 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.64 million shares for consideration of $72.5 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 19.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $543 million, while at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.7 billion. I’ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.
David Stanton: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if -- I’ve got two questions, please. Firstly on bundling, we’ve been hearing stories about the fact that there perhaps might be bundling from competitive bidding coming. I’d like some color on that. And then just one for Brett on gross margin going forward, you’ve guided to 61% to 63%. I presume that’s for FY ‘14. Can you give us some color about why the guidance is down for gross margin? Thank you.
Mick Farrell: David, thanks for the question. I’ll take the first part. I’ll hand the second to Brett. Bundling at CMS, yes, we don’t know where CMS is going with this. They have introduced a discussion item and asking for providers and other physicians in the industry to give feedback. There are two ways to look at this. If CMS does decide to implement bundling, ResMed is not only ready, willing, but also able, to respond to a market like that because we already are in one. In France, we have a bundling model where providers are paid a fixed amount per member, per month to look after patients on sleep apnea therapy. And we work with them. There are certain minima in terms of the number of masks that they have to provide the number of visits, they have to provide the number of tubing, accessories and filters and interaction with the patients. So our assumption is that CMS, if they did go forward, the bundling approach would have such minima in their programs. Looking at it from another angle. There was a recent OIG report that looked at the replenishment rates that are currently there for CMS patients in the U.S. And what it found was for the vast majority of patients they are well under half the maxima requirements by the different category units for existing competitive bidding programs. So we don’t think its way up on the radar. And in response to that OIG report, CMS decided to stay with the current system. So from our perspective, we’d be ready to go with either a bundled model or a not-bundled model. It will be interesting to see where providers land on this but I think that no matter where the market goes, we’ll be prepared to move with it on that front. Brett, do you want to take the second part of the question regarding gross margin?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Mick. On the gross margin front, we sort of ticked down a little bit. And look, it really is a reflection of some of the ASP declines that we’ve seen recently. And I think that had some impact on our margin in Q3. And we just down-ticked a little bit in terms of margin guidance to account for that. And the other factor, I suppose, that’s been helping us out over the last little while has been some FX benefit, particularly with the depreciation in the Aussie dollar. That’s flattened out somewhat now. So those FX benefits, I think, were certainly far less than what we’ve experienced in the past, particularly if you look at it on a sequential basis. So they are kind of those two are the underlying drivers of the slight decline expected in the margin.
David Stanton: So -- and just to confirm that’s an overall -- that 61% to 63%, that’s an overall number for the rest of FY ‘14 or ‘14, sorry?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. This is -- as you know, Dave, a lot of moving parts on the margin. So it gets more difficult to predict, but that is, yeah, that is more a Q4 short-term prediction on the margin.
David Stanton: Okay. So that’s Q4. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
David Clair: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one is just on pricing. You mentioned in the commentary that you have done some pricing adjustments. Are these largely done at this point?
Mick Farrell: Sure, David. Well, pricing is an interaction between us and our customers on a day-to-day basis. It’s a supply-and-demand interaction that goes on. If you are asking specifically whether the effect of CB2, particularly on our U.S. market, is playing out, then I think the answer is yes. We’re nine months into the play-out of CB2 within the U.S. market and we’re 12 months into when the prices were announced for CB2 in the U.S. market. So clearly, our customers have known about this for 12 months in terms of the new pricing. We’ve been working for them over the last nine months. And I think, clearly, in the last quarter, we sent a strong signal to our customers that we’re here to work with you. But I’d like to make the point that we’re here to work with them on two fronts. We’re here to work with them on pricing and terms, but we’re also here to work with them on business efficiency. So we have the ResMed online store which provides HME partners with an automatic access to order 24/7, 365 from ResMed. We have electronic data interchange, which not only large nationals, but now a number of the regionals are getting involved with. We have EasyCare Online, which is an informatics platform available to all our customers. And many, many more patients every day get connected with EasyCare Online. And our providers find it’s a great way to track adherence, drive adherence and measure outcomes. And finally U-Sleep. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you’ve got a trend 10% increase in adherence and you’ve got the opportunity to lower labor costs by 59% by partnering with ResMed then is it all about $1 on the upfront price or is it about $5 saving in the net present value, over a 12, 24 month time period with the patient? So we’re looking at pricing in multiple variants. David, what was your second question?
David Clair: My second question is just -- you described -- it sounds like the U.S. environment is stable to improving. Do you have any metrics you can provide on patient volumes or I guess any color you could provide would be great?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, I’ll ask Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to address the U.S. market.
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah. I think stable to improving is probably the right way to describe it, David. We don’t have -- as you guys know, on these calls, we don’t have perfect data on underlying market demand. We piece it together, just like you guys did too. What we’re seeing is really decent patient volume growth. Our general sense is that, as CB2 has stabilized and the Medicare contracts have shifted, a number of the accounts that won Medicare -- a number of our customers that won Medicare contracts are actually seeing growth in volume. The customers who lost Medicare contracts have in many cases, gone out and worked on referrals that would allow them to capture commercial pay patients. And so you’re seeing some movement in both directions on that front. We think patient growth remains pretty good, both for new patients and also for resupply. So, overall, that trend is, I think, fairly solid in the U.S. market.
David Clair: And then just one last one, if I can sneak it in here. In terms of the AirFit mask launches that are going on right now, do you expect these to carry a price premium to the older masks?
Mick Farrell: Well, traditionally, David, we’ve priced our new masks in line with the products that are currently in market. I mean clearly, we all know that reimbursements generally are moving in a downward trajectory. And so we need to be able to take cost out of the system by business efficiency, but then be able to ensure pricing is relatively stable. So in general, we’ve kept pricing in parity with our new masks with those in the market, or very close to. And that’s the plan not only for the P10 as you mentioned, the pillows mask, but also for the AirFit N10, the nasal mask and the AirFit F10. The full trilogy now of AirFit masks are in the market and we’re really excited about their potential. But pricing is going to be pretty much on par.
David Clair: Great. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Thanks David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America. Please go ahead
Matthew Prior: Yeah good morning guys. Just two questions, both in relation to rest of world flow gen, if I can. Mick, just in terms of the strong comments you made in regards to Europe, if I can just ask any color around France in particular, given that change to informatics regulations as of October. What you’ve seen there; whether that’s helped you in terms of patient compliance or the business model? And then secondly, just given the 4% growth number out of rest of world flow gen, that still remains somewhat depressed versus prior year. Can you give us some sense as to whether Japan is still dragging there or ex-Europe, what’s going on in terms of rest of world flow gen? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: So, I’ll have a go at the France side. And then I’ll ask Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to talk about Japan. I mean the short answer on France is we don’t break out rest of world, as you know, Matt, into detail. And certainly, we don’t break out Europe and then we don’t break out France on the flow gen front. But I can talk to you qualitatively about what’s happening in France, which is a very important market for us. The head of the group that looks at regulatory approval and pricing for this market for us in France established a differential reimbursement model for devices that have wireless capability and devices that don’t have wireless capability. And it was a planned, sequential, phased differential between the two different types of product categories. That was put into place in October last year and has been running for four months. There have been some court appeals by some patient groups and some folks who were involved in the industry that have slowed down the response on that. And that is still in the court for deciding what is the best approach. From the payer front and from the patient front, we think enabling and liberating the data from the bedside table for the payer, for the patient and for the provider is the best thing. And we think that’s where it’s going to land. Having said that, while this has been in play, we have certainly been able to not only sell our device systems but also our EasyCare Online system, which was ready to go October 1, 2013, when that was put in play. So we are prepared. We’re already working with our home care providers in France to make that work. And we see good signals ahead as that plays out in France. But I want to say that that play is well beyond just the country of France. We think that will apply not only in France and Germany and the U.K., but also across all of Western Europe and has high potential in that space. Rob, do you want to address the Japan question?
Rob Douglas: Sure, Matt. Japan remains a lumpy market for us. It’s basically a good market with good reimbursement and really good focus on patient care. But how the -- in terms of specific ordering patterns of our customers and the way their managing their fleet, that type of thing it remains a lumpy market. It hasn’t been a strong quarter for us in Japan.
Matthew Prior: Great. Thanks, guys. And if I can just have one more in terms of the U.S., in particular, on CPAP, Mick, you mentioned last quarter that the price competition was particularly focused in the CPAP category. Have you seen that bleed into APAP at all, in terms of discounting pressure?
Mick Farrell: Matt, we don’t -- as we said on the last call, we don’t go into details on pricing across the whole category of flow gens and certainly won’t go into details on individual categories. But as a summary statement, pricing impacts have been across the board on categories. And what we’re doing is appropriately pricing across SKUs but across customers, across segments, across geographies for appropriate pricing, to ensure solid volume gain and long-term good revenue growth. And to signal to our customers that we’re therefore doing CB2, but also that we are there for you to drive business efficiency, as well as looking at the upfront pricing.
Matthew Prior: Great, understood. Thanks, guys.
Mick Farrell: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA. Please go ahead.
Bruce Du: Yes, can you hear me?
Mick Farrell: Yes. You must have been on mute.
Bruce Du: Yes. Okay. Great. I just had a question in relation to the masks. And specifically around your experience in terms of the AirFit P10, whether you are predominantly seeing that growth in new patients, or you are seeing actual conversions from existing patients. Given my understanding, obviously, is that historically patients have been quite sticky on masks and you guys obviously would have a benefit if you can convert those patients given the fewer parts in a lot of masks and whatnot. But just could you talk to your experience, in terms of converting the North American patients or whether or not the growth dynamic there is mainly existing versus new patients?
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Bruce. Well, you’re right in that. It is quite sticky. Like a great pair of jeans or a pair shoes that you love, patients tend to stick to the existing product, even when they go for the new purchase and that trend has remained. The AirFit P10, which we launched in January, is now in day 90 in the U.S. market. And as we said earlier, is just launching into Europe and Asia-Pacific, as we speak here in Q4. So talking about the U.S. these last 90 days, we’re sort of starting that S-curve of penetration of a fantastic new product. I actually personally use the AirFit P10 every night. I wore it last night. And it is an unobtrusive, light and very comfortable mask. And it’s particularly -- its diffusion of the air is so comfortable for the bed partner, that we do expect great success from it. But we expect that success primarily with the new patients.
Bruce Du: Okay. Great. And just I guess, you referenced before the GAO report, just wondering, obviously one of the things that data point showed was quite a significant consolidation in terms of the market share of the four largest distributors. Is that pretty consistent with what you’re seeing in the Round 2 regions thus far as well?
Mick Farrell: Bruce, I’m not sure I’ll get the gist of your question. Can you ask it one more time and then Jim and I will have a go at getting to it?
Bruce Du: It was just in relation to I guess the Round 1, the GAO report recently released showed the concentration of market share in the Round I areas of the four largest DMEs in the U.S. had increased quite considerably over the first 12 months of Round I. I was just wondering whether or not you had seen, I guess a similar pattern evolving the Round 2 regions thus far?
Mick Farrell: Dave, why don’t you -- David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.
David Pendarvis: Sure. So, Bruce, I’m pretty familiar with that report. And obviously, it was based on some early data, Round 2 of competitive bidding, a much bigger chunk of the overall U.S. market. And as Jim was saying earlier, while we’re seeing things play out in terms of market share shifts in the winners for Medicare patients and also in terms of the commercial patients shifting, it’s probably too early to say whether there’s any significant consolidation along the lines that that report found in Medicare, so just early days. You could posit that it would be the case, but we haven’t seen it yet.
Bruce Du: Okay. Thank you.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks Bruce.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Michael Matson: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was just curious about -- with your pricing adjustments, the timing of that. I know you discussed it on your last conference call. But that was already a few months into the March quarter. So is that something that started kind of at the very beginning of the calendar year? Or was it something that was kind of done mid-quarter? Because I guess your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter kind of -- fiscal fourth quarter, kind of implies that there’s some additional declines coming in gross margin. So, maybe you could just clarify that for me?
Mick Farrell: Yes. So, Mike, the call that we did was actually in January, so we were in month one of Q3 when we made the call. And we said, we were going to appropriately price to ensure volume gains and revenue gains. And also, as I’ve been focusing on this call, about the efficiency gains that we can provide, the solutions we can give to our HME providers. I would say, those discussions happened throughout the quarter. With well north of 4,000 customers in the U.S. and you think, globally, you are in the tens of thousands of customers this is something that happens throughout a daily basis, a weekly basis, as we interact with our customers. So, clearly, the spread is throughout the quarter. Brett’s guidance of $0.61 to $0.63 I think is solid. It takes into account what we have done and have seen and what we expect to see here in Q4. So it all makes sense. And it all makes sense for ensuring we’re appropriately priced, we have got the appropriate terms and we focus on the efficiencies we can provide by talking to customers and providing that value to them.
Michael Matson: And just so that I get it clearly here, the bulk of these adjustments are -- have already taken place, as of the end of the March quarter? Is that a fair statement? I know you are always having these discussions, but I guess this was kind of a bigger than normal type of cycle that you went through here so?
Mick Farrell: Yes, look, clearly, Mike, there are many factors involved in the supply-demand, our activity, competitive activity, changes in the market. But yeah, as I said earlier, given that we’re 12 months into the pricing of CB2 within the U.S., nine months into the play-out of how it hits the P&L for our U.S. based customers, that being the largest impact change that’s happened on the reimbursement front, I think your assumption is right. The bulk of the impact is there and our guidance going forward is that we’re going to work with our customers to make sure it happens. And we’ll be flexible, based on the needs of the market.
Michael Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then just one question on the Astral family of products. Is that a completely new product category that you’re entering? Or is that sort of a redesign of an existing product line that you already had?
Mick Farrell: So, I will hand over to Geoff Neilson, our President of the Respiratory Care business.
Geoff Neilson: So that’s a completely new life support product platform. And we do have life-support products through our Elisee and VS lines available in rest of world, but we haven’t brought these products to the U.S. market. So this will be a new product line in the U.S. market. We estimate the global market for that product -- the available market for that product to be around $200 million something and evenly split between the U.S. and Europe. So we’ve got that upside for bringing that product to U.S.
Michael Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then just one final question on the flow generator business. I know in the past few years you had been seeing a really nice mix shift towards some of the auto setting and bi-levels. And some of that, I guess, was being driven by the move toward home testing. So, are you still seeing that mix shift happening in that part of your business?
Mick Farrell: Mike, we are. Home sleep testing, we are tracking very closely. And on a trailing 12-month basis, between 35% and 40% of U.S. diagnosis and these last 12 months were through home sleep testing. With the prior authorization and the focus of insurance companies on this space, the needle continues to tick up on that. And as you look forward the next 6, 12 months, we’ll be looking at 40% to 45%, approaching 50%, of diagnosis in the home sleep testing front in that timeframe. So we think we know that that will start to move up and we know that that will drive a mix shift from CPAP to APAP on a continuing basis. We also think the introduction of products like the Astral with its large $200 million addressable market, globally and then you add all the other respiratory care ventilators that we have in our pipeline and will continue to introduce. There’s a lot of upside on the flow generator front in terms of positive mix shift for us.
Michael Matson: All right. Thanks a lot.
Mick Farrell: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sean Laaman: Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me, perhaps for Brett; relates to FX. Just if you could give us, Brett, a bit of a guide on the benefits seen in COGS from movements in FX. And secondly, what hedge gains were there, or might there have been in the other income line?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. Sure, Sean. I’ll do it a few different ways. If you just looked at it sequentially Q2 to Q3, we didn’t see any FX benefit at all come through. It was pretty neutral. We’re still getting some of the benefits coming through if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, so that was in the order of 100 basis points year-on-year was benefiting us, but neutral on a sequential basis. So that was the impact there. And then the other part of that question, Sean?
Sean Laaman: The hedge gains in the other income line?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, that was in the other income. It was in the order of a few million dollars.
Sean Laaman: Perfect. That’s all I have. Thanks, Brett.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ben Andrew: Good afternoon, guys. So, I guess a couple questions for us. Can you give us maybe some other examples of things that suggest to you that the market is stabilizing? Are you seeing promotions decline? Are you seeing kind of quarter-on-quarter pricing changes normalize? Maybe just talk a little bit more about those specific examples in the marketplace.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Ben. I’ll address some and hand to Jim for some other early indicators here. We talked about this at J.P. Morgan and we’ve talked about it since, but we’re seeing primary care physician’s visits start to pick up. We’re seeing referrals from those primary care physicians related to sleep specifically, whether they are referrals to a sleep lab for a PSG, or to home sleep testing, IDTF type models increase. So the needles on both of those are moving up. There’s publicly available data from the payers and there’s some from CMS. And there is some private data that we were able to access from talking to some of the private payers. All of those show the needles are ticking up in terms of patient volumes. So the leading indicators on referrals and on the reimbursement are starting to tick up. And those indicate for us, that the stability in the U.S. market is starting to come back and volume growth is picking up. We also saw volume growth for ourselves during the quarter. We’re not going to go specifically into that because we’re not releasing our ASPs. And so if we give you the volume gains, you’ll be able to reverse calculate that. And we don’t want to do that for competitive reasons. But we know the volumes are starting to stabilize and starting to pick up, not just through the early indicators, but through many interactions we have with our customers. Jim, any more color to add there?
Jim Hollingshead: I think it’s a great question, Ben and it’s difficult to point to concrete thing. But I guess I would point to two or three things. The first one is just to reiterate what Mick just said. Volume growth is strong and volume growth was stronger in Q3 than it had been over the previous couple of quarters, I would say. So that’s a good indication. The topic of conversation with our customers is shifting. Every customer is different and there’s thousands of customers that are different size and different business mixes. But the conversations we are having now tend to be more about how do I stabilize my own product mix? How do I do X, Y and Z, to drive profitability? That’s a really different topic of conversation than it was, say, right after rates went into effect. And so you can see our customers have worked through some of the chaos that they faced with reimbursement changes and are now stabilizing their own business models and they’re asking different questions. And we tend to be working with them on things like business efficiency more than we were, say, two quarters ago. And then I’d say, the kind of tone and tenor in the market, just the sort of qualitative feel in the market. This is a very qualitative thing, but I’d say the vibe is a bit better. Nobody is happy about reimbursement rates. None of our customers are and we are not. That continues to be a tough pill to swallow. But the tone and tenor has improved in our conversations with customers and just generally on the market.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And then I guess another question of the two, for me would be to Mick. And if you take the gross margin trends, where the currency is at, you’ve given us pretty specific guidance relative to the fourth quarter, if you will of your fiscal year. If we flow that into ‘15, is that stable? Or is that going to take another step lower, because of the move of some currency as we roll that in?
Mick Farrell: Yeah, Ben. As you know, there are multiple factors that go into gross margin from COGS reductions, mix shifts and exchanges between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Aussie and the U.S. dollar and the Aussie. We’ve been able to achieve some fantastic efficiencies through what we’re doing in our Singapore plant and growing there. We’re doing some great things on the S9 platform in some of the masks that have been out there for a while. But at the same time, we’re introducing new products, which can have an impact on that. Our primary focus is on ensuring topline growth and making sure that goes through. In gross margin, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance for Q4, can be a tool to help us ensure that we continue to have good revenue growth. So, I know, Ben, you are sort of asking me to posit FY ‘15 GM. We don’t do that. We put it out 90 days and we give that guidance of 61% to 63% that Brett just did, because that’s the sort of time horizon that we think we can predict it on, in a useful manner. So, Q4, 61% to 63%. We’re solid with that. And then in 90 days, we’ll get in touch regarding Q1 for FY ‘15.
Ben Andrew: Okay. And maybe just another way of looking at that, is the balance of interests here between volume growth ticking back up? Is your share beginning to tick back up, as you’ve made these adjustments to price, or is share really kind of stabilizing? Even just qualitatively on masks and/or generators would be helpful? Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Look, I’ll just talk to it generally. I would say our share not only is stabilized, but probably we took a little bit of share when you think about the global scale. And we think that’s the right position for us to be as the market leader. Thanks, Ben.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Anthony Petrone: Hi. Thanks gentlemen. I guess, Mick, to just follow up on the market share comments that you just threw out there. I mean, was that specific -- it sounds like you’ve put in a new pricing strategy here in the U.S. and then had sort an effect on market share shifts. So, specifically in the U.S., did those price changes result in a share gain, say, amongst your large DME customers, Lincare, Apria and Rotech, for instance, or did you see more share gains on smaller customers? Just trying to get a sense of how that played out in the quarter.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don’t go into the detailed share across the categories, certainly not by individual customer type. But qualitatively and generally, looking at the U.S. market specifically, we think -- what we said 90 days ago is that we’re going to appropriately price to ensure that ResMed remains the market leader and ensures providing business efficiency for our customers. We executed on that in the last 90 days and I do think we got some volume share gain. And clearly, there were some price concessions that were a part of that. But more importantly were the hooks we put into our customers for the long-term, which is we’re working with you, we’re partnering with you and we’re going to help you lower your costs. So it’s a high value for you, the patient and ultimately the payer, who will save as we keep these patients out of hospital and in the home. But, no, we won’t go into further detail than that.
Anthony Petrone: Sure. No, fair enough. And maybe just with this new pricing strategy within the U.S. and it seems amongst the competitors, I mean, is there a way where to sort of look out and sort of judge timing-wise, where -- not necessarily it’s a floor, but it goes back to where the normal was, which I think, if we go back a couple of years ago, it was normal to see 4% to 5% price declines in the industry. It seems like it’s more than that now, certainly in the U.S. But is there a time where it gets back to normalization? And then just one quick follow-up on CMS audits. Thanks.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Anthony, so if you look back at the last five, even 10 years, there are step changes and then there are settling, slow gradient changes that have happened in our industry. Clearly, we have had a step change. I’m not going to go into specifics of percentages and year-on-year, as we talked about 90 days ago. That doesn’t make sense for competitive reasons. But qualitatively thinking about it, there are step changes that happened and that has happened. Do we expect that stability after a step change? Yes. Are we working towards that? Yes. Would our customers like it? I actually think yes, because stability in this market, now that CB2 has been digested and planning forward now, which is for how do we get to the $40 million to $60 million Americans, right? We’re talking about the U.S. market, $40 million to $60 million Americans that have sleep disordered breathing. Remember we’ve only got $6 million of them diagnosed and treated. It’s going to happen through stability in the investments in working with primary care physicians; working with patient awareness to drive the patients through to the channel. We’re starting to see that stability, starting to see the needle pop up and we’re going to continue to do that. So your third, sneak question there, Anthony, was regard to?
Anthony Petrone: Yeah, I apologize. Just we attended Spring Medtrade and there was just this whole focus on CMS audits of DMEs. I’m just wondering if you have an opinion on that and how that just sort of shaking out? Thanks again.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. I’ll hand that to Jim.
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, we think that the audit rate and the procedure for audit is a huge burden on our customers. And we would prefer to see Medicare get their act together.
Mick Farrell: Fair enough. Thanks, Anthony.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Goodsall: Thanks very much guys actually, that was a question I had. That was the hot topic we found at Medtrade, as well. And I guess Jim answered that just in terms of the intensity there, I guess they would the intensity they -- I guess you would expect to grow. I guess what my question was, is anything that impacting sales? And is there anything you can do. I know you’ve spoken to U-Sleep to help with DMEs through that audit process?
Mick Farrell: Actually, we’ve seen some stability. Look, I’m not as close to it as Jim, so I’ll let him answer it in a second. From where I’ve seen it and certainly as you look at American Association for Homecare and a lot of the providers now getting on Capitol Hill and working with CMS to understand how to solve this. They are certainly focusing on -- audits are important, because if there’s fraud abuse, you need to catch it and move it out. But you can’t have the one bad apple spoil the whole barrel. And clearly, that’s the message from the providers. And clearly, nine, 12 months into these changes, I think even CMS and the auditors are starting to realize that changing the game and ensuring these patients stay out of hospital is the right thing for the U.S. healthcare system; and particularly, Medicare going through all the changes it’s going through right now and all the patients coming in with the Affordable Care Act. So as we look towards it, we actually see some stability rather than growing of the audits, in terms of how they are looking at it. But, Jim, I don’t know if you have any color there.
Jim Hollingshead: So what I would say is we have very little we can do about Medicare and how they’re doing audits. So it’s a burden on our customers because, as you guys know, there’s a big backlog in audits and Medicare is not processing them, in many cases, in a timely fashion. And that hurts our customers’ cash flow, because their payments get held up. And so, it is a hot topic. And it’s understandable that it’s a hot topic. We don’t see any measurable, direct impact on sales, because patients come in the door and they need to get set up and DMEs will set them up. But it’s frustrating for us to watch what our customers have to go through in that regulatory environment that is actually not operating efficiently, right. So, I think it’s a positive that there’s a spotlight put on it. So it’s something that’s been raised and I think it has been raised also at the Congressional level. Now it’s gotten some scrutiny and the OIG has looked at it and so on. So, hopefully, there will be a resolution. I don’t know if it’s going to get more intense before it gets better. But, as I said, I think it would be better if Medicare could find a way to relieve that, especially the backlog. It’s completely appropriate for Medicare to be policing what DMEs do, what -- in any space that they are reimbursing and making sure that there’s no fraud and abuse and that patients are being treated appropriately. But to place an extra burden in terms of volume of audits and then not be able to process them within their own guidelines is arguably unfair and needs to be corrected.
Mick Farrell: I guess the follow-on there is just from a technology front; is there anything that you can bring to the table I guess going forward that might help them with the informatics and the documentation they need to provide here?
Jim Hollingshead: I think we’re looking at a range of solutions that are business process automation solutions. Every flow point, every business flow point for our customers is an area under scrutiny. And with some areas in development, we’re not going to talk about our product roadmap for competitive reasons.
Andrew Goodsall: Sure.
Mick Farrell: Thanks for your questions, Andrew.
Andrew Goodsall: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ian Abbott: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, just looking at the sequentially -- a question for Brett -- looking at the impact of FX on gross margin, heading into Q4. I know it’s been quite volatile over the last few months. Can you perhaps give a bit of color as to what that impact will be?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. I think going into Q4 -- look, I’d estimate we’re at probably a slight positive for us, probably in the order of 30 basis points on a sequential basis. It will probably eat a little bit. The currency has been jumping around a lot likely; it’s pretty volatile. So I think that you’d probably see a small benefit in Q4. And then on a sequential basis, you kind of lose that, I think, going forward into Q1. But it’s nothing like what we were getting over the 12 months year-on-year period. It is starting to certainly flatten out.
Ian Abbott: Okay. And then my second question is on the accounts receivable. That seemed to go up quite significantly during that balanced state. Is there anything driving that? And would you think that would normalize going forward?
Brett Sandercock: Revenues are up sequentially and the receivables would be up. If I look at the days sales, that’s pretty much in our -- how we look at it, pretty much in our historical range that we look at, Ian. So it might be an uptick in absolute terms, but I think when you look at DSOs, that it looks in the range.
Ian Abbott: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Steve Wheen: Yeah, good morning. And I just wanted to ask about the new product launches that you have. What sort of impact they -- you could expect to see on the gross margin, from perhaps efficiencies in manufacturing processes?
Mick Farrell: Well, so, we’ve launched the AirFit P10, the AirFit N10, the AirFit F10, as well as the Astral, so it’s quite a complex set of products to talk to. Rob, do you want to have a go?
Robert Douglas: Yes. I mean, again, Steve, we don’t break out all the details of this. But, generally, our policy with our R&D and our product teams is to continually improve products by making them simpler, less parts and better supplier relationships. Obviously, as you introduce new products, you then restart on an experience curve, which you then start putting on continuous improvements onto and that will ramp down. And then as we go up the learning curve, building initial launch volumes and all of that type of thing, it’s quite a complex thing. So there’s many factors at play here. And then net of it is -- the intent of our product program is to drive cost out of the products and keep trying to improve them and make them better in many parameters. And we expect to see that continuing.
Steve Wheen: Okay. And just also in the gross margin, we’ve been seeing that - this perhaps is a question for Brett that mix shift advantage from CPAP to APAP. Has that largely run out now, that we’re -- I would say, probably to move into that sort of shift? And are we more, now, just particularly in this quarter, seeing mix shift advantages just because masks will be greater than flow generators?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Steve. I think, look at over the last few years, you can probably -- that shift, or mix shift impact, has probably moderated overtime either time. I think it’s still up and it’s moderated to some extent. But I think some of the other new generation platforms such as Astral and so on -- as we get through that, as we get deeper into FY ‘15, I think some of those will be supportive of product mix and then supportive of gross margin as well. But it’s really early -- as Rob said, it’s really early days in the launch. We have three new mask products. We have the brand-new Astral platform. And we do certainly see, as we work through a lot of the margin expansion initiatives, that we can drive those costs, over the next 12 months as our experience increases on these new products and certainly think we can get some upside there, Whether that plays out in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, I think there areas there that are certainly providing potential for us in my view.
Steve Wheen: And so I guess and more specifically to the quarter, was there quite an advantage, just given that very strong mask growth rate from a mix shift perspective?
Brett Sandercock: You know what? If I looked at it -- so if I look at it year-on-year, we still had a strong. If f you like, we still had product mix benefits flowing through and that was meaningful. If you look at it purely sequentially, it was more of much smaller -- it was a much smaller impact.
Steve Wheen: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Hanover: Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I just wanted to ask a couple, or one, strategic question. And that is in relation to Japan and what will it take to get Japan on more steady footing?
Mick Farrell: Andrew, I will hand that question to Rob Douglas.
Robert Douglas: So, on Japan, it’s a long project for us. It’s always been a lumpy market. And quite frankly, that’s just the way structure -- the way that our customers are structured and the way they run their business. For us, it means it’s a very efficient market. There’s only a small number of customers. They are running these large businesses. It’s good market for us, because we don’t need a large team to service it, but we do have the downside of this lumpiness. So we don’t see that type of structure changing at all. In a sense, some of that lumpiness will continue. Our view of the Japan market is that underlying it, it’s actually still quite underpenetrated. And so our efforts are generally around either providing clinical evidence of the benefit of our products in Japan, or driving demand and patient awareness in the medical system there to drive patients in. That’s got to be offset by relationships with the reimbursement authorities in Japan, so that -- or the funding can all add up to that, as well, But that’s been an ongoing project and we’ll keep on with that strategy.
Andrew Hanover: Great. And actually one more question and it’s in relation to diagnostic testing. Back in October, you said that approximately 35% of diagnostic tests were being performed home -- via home sleep testing. And it was supposed get to 40% to 45% in the U.S. over the next 12 months. Just wanted to get a perspective or an update on that. Thank you.
Mick Farrell: Yeah. So, Andrew, I just said a little earlier in the Q&A that we’re a little north of that 35% from October. We’re now looking at 35% to 40%, so the needle is still moving up. It’s not moving up as fast as it was, but it’s moving up in that sort of 5% increments over those two quarters. As we look forward towards October, at the end of this year, we still think it will be at that 40% to 45% area. And even by the end of the calendar year, that 45% might tick-up a little and start to approach 50%. But it’s payer-by-payer; it’s group-by-group. And it has really been driven by the payer authorities working with their sleep physicians and the home sleep testing as well as the sleep labs, to ensure that patients can get through on therapy. Moving to a scaled one, allowing the mix shift from CPAP to APAP, we see that trend continuing to play out. Jim, do you want to provide some more color?
Jim Hollingshead: Yeah, I’d just add a couple of interesting tidbits on that. The first one is that our data show that, right now, roughly 60% of sleep labs are doing home sleep testing. And that’s pretty dramatic movement over the last several months. Many sleep labs were trying to avoid doing home sleep testing, but now roughly 60% are engaged in home sleep testing. And the other thing that’s quite interesting in our dataset with sleep labs -- sleep labs that do actively engage with home sleep testing actually end up doing more overall volume, including in-lab overnight volume. And so both of those things suggest that home sleep testing adoption will continue to move forward. Now that sleep labs are realizing that it’s in their interest to do it as well.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks.
Mick Farrell: Great. Thanks, John. As always, I’d like to thank all of you on this conference call for your interest and your support of ResMed. Most importantly, I’d like to thank the global ResMed team, providing solutions in over 100 countries, for your focus on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you very much. See you in 90 days.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2014 ResMed Inc. Earnings Call. My name is Sherry and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in the ResMed SEC filings which are available on the company's website. (Operator Instructions) Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO, and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.
Michael Farrell: Thanks, Sherry, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I will review the highlights of our fiscal Q2 and then I will hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in some more detail. So first the financial summary. Global revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 grew by 2% year-on-year to $384 million, that’s up 1% on a constant currency basis. Europe, Asia, and rest of the world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $178 million, which is 5% on constant currency terms. Americas revenue decreased by 2% to $207 million. We believe the long-term global growth rate for our industry remains in the 6% to 8% range. Net income for the quarter increased 11% to $86.6 million. GAAP EPS increased by 13% to $0.60 for the quarter, while hybrid EPS which includes the amortization of intangibles, was $0.61 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the global team. Let me start with the Americas, where clearly we had some external headwinds and where we were not satisfied with the results. The Americas had a challenging quarter with overall sales decreasing by approximately $5 million year-on-year, which was 2% on a year-on-year basis. It's interesting to note that it was approximately $5 million increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis which is a 3% sequential quarter-to-quarter increase. Sales revenues from masks were flat year-on-year while flow generator sales revenue declined by 5% year-on-year. It's also of note that we were up against some very tough prior year comparisons in both those categories. Float generators were up 16% in Q2 fiscal 2013 and masks were also up 16% 12 months ago in Q2 fiscal '13. However, the result was not solely a reflection on these comparables. I will walk through the two key areas of impact in this regard. Firstly, competitive bidding, and secondly, competitor actions in the marketplace. So first, on competitive bidding. U.S. market dynamics were challenging in Q2 and remain challenging today as we have been discussing. The distraction we saw in Q1 continued throughout Q2. As we had indicated it would on our core. And our customers have grappled with the U.S. reimbursement changes that went into effect in July for Medicare patients, which is a CB2. As we discussed on our Q1 call, winners and losers of competitive bids adjusted their market strategies and structures. And this temporary distraction caused a net reduction in sales volumes for the quarter. Patients are navigating their way through the new HME landscape while HME providers simultaneously try to ensure that patients they are picking up meet their reimbursement and documentation criteria. This occasionally causes what are so called orphan patients, who are not able to be serviced by the old or a new HME. And this has reduced net volumes for the quarter. This also impacts new patients as winning HMEs establish a presence in territories through subcontracts, acquisitions of assets or Greenfield [indiscernible]. As we work through these challenges with our U.S. HME customers, we continue to believe that this interruption in volume is temporary. Customers are developing new business models and footprints and finding ways to serve both new and existing patient needs. While it is hard to predict the future precisely, we continue to think that there is a number of months before the market stabilizes. The key signs we see indicating that this the case are that the distraction is beginning to recede in some leading indicators in the U.S. market. First, we continue to see new patient growth in the U.S., in PCP visits, in elective procedures, and in referrals to sleep physicians. Second, many of our U.S. customers are picking up existing and new patient volume through asset purchases and referral pathway development. The other key area I want to walk through in regard to competitor actions. We saw impact from our competitors in Q2 in addition to the external market conditions. On the product introduction front we saw strong competition in both the nasal mask and the nasal pillows categories. Product introductions from our major competitors have reversed some portion of the share gains that we have had in these two categories over the last number of years. Competitive pricing, particularly in the CPAP category, also influenced our results. And we are establishing appropriate value pricing premiums to ensure that we get back to taking share in that category too. Let me go into a little more detail on product introduction. We are executing to our plan that we talked about in our Q1 call to bring a strong product pipeline to the market. This product innovation dynamic is returned to the competitive product cycle that we have demonstrated for over two decades in this market. We are confident that our new product offerings and our pipeline can address this challenge. It is a game we have played before and we know that we can win. Last quarter we said we would launch three new masks throughout this fiscal year and we are executing well against that plan. At the beginning of last week, we launched the AirFit P10, our latest nasal pillows system. This is our quietest mask to date. It is 50% quieter than the market category leader, our existing Swift FX. The AirFit P10 is literally whisper quiet. It is also 50% lighter, weighing in at just 1.6 ounces. And finally, its revolutionary vent technology which we call quite air, gently diffuses the air, minimizing disturbance to both the patient and their bed partner. After only two weeks in the market, the AirFit P10 has received many positive reviews in social media, on the online stores, and from patients who have tried the product with our U.S. HME customers. I personally have been using this product for the last two months and I got to tell you, it's the most comfortable, quite and effective mask that we have brought to the market. Continuing with our announced product innovation plan, we will launch two additional new masks during the balance of fiscal year 2014. We expect them to similarly be well received by patients, providers, physicians and patients. Let me also go into a little more detail on pricing. Clearly the pricing environment is very competitive in the Americas, pricing declines impacted our results across the board in the U.S., but especially in our CPAP product category. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our price premium, category by category, segment by segment. And we will ensure that we are appropriately positioned reflecting both the current market realities and the superior value proposition that our products deliver to our patients and to our providers. Importantly, I want to let you know that for competitive reasons, we are not going to announce the details of our average selling price changes. Whether global or by region, or by product segment. The reason behind this is that one, other market participants do not publically reveal their amount of detail, and two, we are concerned this information may affect us in the marketplace. In short, we don’t believe doing so is in the best interests of our shareholders. Finally, on the Americas and before turning to Europe, Asia and rest of the world, there are a few bright spots in the Americas results for Q2. We saw good growth of our Adapt SV and Stellar devices, reflecting our emerging growth in both cardiology and respiratory care markets. The Stellar received regulatory approval in Brazil during the quarter and we are encouraged about the prospect for respiratory care in the Latin America market over the coming years. The VPAP COPD, which is the first and only device with an FDA clearance with an indication for use to treat COPD, is gaining traction in respiratory care. And finally, accessories sales for both flow generators and for masks was solid, reflecting growth in the installed base. And the fact that many of our customers despite competitive bidding continued to drive an increased their focus on patient replenishment programs. So now I am going to switch to on our review on Europe where we saw good growth with solid performances in many countries, including European dealer network, the U.K., Switzerland and both our German dealer business as well as our German homecare business. Two of the main drivers of growth in Europe were our respiratory care and cardiology markers, including in particular the products, Stellar and AutoSet CS, which both produced good growth. It's interesting to note that in Europe plus Asia and rest of the world, our flow generator growth year-on-year was plus 6% constant currency. We also contribution from our recently released mask products in that region, the Quattro Air and the Nano. In France, the previously announced telemonitoring requirements went into effect October the first, right at the start of the quarter. We believe this development started to help and will help grow our share in flow generators in the region. The emerging focus on healthcare informatics in France and throughout Europe as it grows, plays to ResMed's strength. We are seeing interesting in EasyCare Online solutions both within France but now outside France in various parts of Europe, where customer's recognize EasyCare Online is efficient and provides adherence benefits and high quality. It also has incredibly strong and robust data protection that is increasingly important for these markets and also for our global customers. We continued to expand our reach in Eastern Europe during the quarter, building on our recent acquisition that we announced in Q1 in Poland. In December we acquired Unimedis, which is a Czech Republic based distributor of sleep disordered-breathing and respiratory care products. The Czech Republic has a population of over 10 million and its healthcare spending ranks just below the general European level and has more physicians per capita than most other EU countries. This acquisition allows us to drive market growth in emerging markets opportunity in Eastern Europe, in Poland and now Czech Republic across sleep disordered-breathing, homecare ventilation, as well as cardiology markets. In the Asia Pacific region, sales growth was light. Although we were encouraged by progress in our cardiology sales in Japan, overall sales to our Japanese customers were not as strong as we would have hoped. We expect Asia-Pac to be stronger in the second half of this fiscal year as patient flow remains solid in the region overall. And we are partnering with our customers in the regions to do so. We saw good growth in China in Q2 and we remain confident in the long-term opportunities of emerging markets in Asia-Pac, as well as the more established markets in the region of Japan and Australia, New Zealand. Turning to R&D. In addition to the patient interface product development that we mentioned on our press release earlier in the call, we are also making good progress in our respiratory care pipeline. We are on track to launch our next generation respiratory care platform in Europe during this fiscal year, with a subsequent launch into the Americas and then into Asia-Pac. We have a strong R&D team focused on bringing meaningful innovation to the market and the benefit to patients, physicians and providers in this space. It includes the diseases of COPD, neuromuscular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and beyond. We are very encouraged by the results of the first patients who are being put on this next generation respiratory care product and we will go into further detail in the coming quarters. In short, horizon two of our three horizons growth strategy, which is this respiratory care market, is lining up for growth in Europe and then the Americas and Asia-Pac. Watch this space. Let me close with this. We remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain underpenetrated and absolutions provide symptomatic relief of patients while slowing the progression of key chronic diseases, while saving money to the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions, we have the right people, and we have the right strategy to succeed. We are confident that we will continue to do so. Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett, over to you.
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the December quarter was $394.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 1%. Income from operations for the quarter was $105 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, and net income for the quarter was $86.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 64.7%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to Q2 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 65%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structure. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 5%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.7% compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 20.8%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $206.6 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside the Americas totaled $177.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.7 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $117.9 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other also increased by 1%. Cash flow from operations was $84.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19.7 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.6 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $74 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $537 million, and at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: I actually have two. The first one happens to be, how much of the foreign exchange uptick year-over-year is associated with foreign exchange.
Michael Farrell: Brett?
Brett Sandercock: How much of the earnings?
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Well, no. I mean your -- the gross margin was up well over 200 basis points year-over-year, almost 300 basis points. And I am just wondering how much of that is from foreign exchange.
Brett Sandercock: On the margin, yes. So on the year-over-year, Joanne, on the FX was about 140 basis points of that.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: And that’s mostly related to the Aussie, the Australian dollar?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Predominantly. We have a -- there is a little bit of benefit from the euro but that’s predominantly the Aussie dollar weakening.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then I understand why you don’t want to talk about your pricing paradigm, but can you step back and talk a little bit about what's happening to pricing in the industry?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Joanne, I mean they are pretty much the same thing asking what we are doing in pricing, what the industry is doing with pricing. Given that we want to maintain our appropriate value premium over our competitors but ensure that we are competitively priced to make sure we get back to taking share. So specifically within the U.S. market, we are looking at our value premiums and ensuring, based upon the market dynamics that are going on throughout Q1 and as we saw in Q2, to make sure that we get back to taking share across the segments. So we are looking at pricing on a category by category basis and SKU by SKU basis and the segment by segment basis, based upon how the customers look at it. But to qualify that, whether by industry or by us, we would sort be parallel and it doesn’t make sense to break out either. It's just not in the interests of our shareholders to do so.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Just [indiscernible] a little bit on that. One of the things I am seeing from other companies that have products with competitive bidding is that the other companies around them are dropping prices that they need to respond to. I am going to assume that’s what's going on in your world also.
Michael Farrell: Look, Joanne, we are the value premium leader. We don’t generally in our industry move down ahead of the curve. So I think that’s a safe assumption to say and, yeah, it's safe to say that we are more responding on the downward approach and trying to find and elicit the appropriate premium to maintain across each of the SKUs. And we have got pretty good signs behind this and it's really just an adjustment of external dynamics with our internal dynamics to make sure that all makes sense. But the premise does sound like what we have been executing to.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from David Clair of Piper Jaffray.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: So I was just hoping, Mick, in the commentary you talked about a moderating impact to competitive bidding in the quarter. Can you just give us some additional thoughts there? And I know you talked about 6% to 8% global growth, do you think that U.S. grew as a market or did it decline? And when do you think that we should expect ResMed to kind of rebound and put up positive growth in the U.S.
Michael Farrell: Yes. I mean clearly in the U.S. market, we talk about 6% to 8% as the long-term growth of this industry. Clearly there is some impacts through competitive biddings. We talked about the patients who get moving from HME A to HME B, you know these last 90 days, that will have some impact on the growth. We don’t have it down to the decimal point, and to your point, it doesn’t make sense to go there. But the leading indicators that we see that -- and we have a lot of data on this and some of it's public. And we have shared that on our latest investor presentation that patient flow to primary care physicians are picking up. Patient flow for elective procedures which are analogous to referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, such as hip and knee replacements, are starting to move up. Referrals specifically in our industry to sleep-disordered breathing specialists are starting to move up on the diagnostic front. So all these leading indicators are macro and generally public, and allow us to talk about them. We have many other indicators that we have customer by customer as they buy assets of patients. So they are starting to monetize that asset. Getting the pipe work together. Working with patients to ensure that pipe works is of the standard of the acquiring HME versus the HME who sold the asset, and ensuring that they can get that replenishment revenue and get the patients back on the right care that’s needed to happening there. So they are the sort of what we would call, David, the green shoots of growth that we are seeing on these leading indicators to make us believe that the impact of competitive bidding is beginning to moderate in the market. We are not done but there are green shoots starting to appear which, as we look forward the next 12, 24, 36 months, we see a whole lot of opportunity. The change that we often get asked that is, will be it a one month or a three month, or a five month. We don’t know exactly. And so we say it's a number of months for those green shoots to start turning to moderation of the entire market and for us to, as an industry, get back on the growth track. And we think we are well positioned to do that, we are partnering with our HME customers to do that.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the pipeline, I mean obviously you guys have a lot of stuff going on there. Can you give us a sneak peek at Medtrade? Should we expect some material product launches coming up here?
Michael Farrell: So David, we don’t give sneak peeks on any trade show. Not one for Medtrade or about trade shows in medicare in Europe or elsewhere. But I will recite what I said, that we have three amazing new masks coming this fiscal year. The first one is out there, the AirFit P10. The other two masks will go on other categories and they are very exciting. Can't give you any details, David. I can tell you that we have a respiratory care next generation platform that has had its first patient on therapy already in Europe, and we are excited about a full product launch of that product before the end of the fiscal year. That I can share with you. But no details on any of the trade shows throughout 2014, David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: So let’s see. If we think about volumes and new patients are growing and overall domestic CPAP was down 5%, in the lower side masks were flat. That has to suggest that existing patient volume on masks was -- volume was either negative or modestly positive if price is probably worse this quarter than it had been. Is that a fair way to characterize it?
Michael Farrell: Well, Ben, you used a number of different parameters there. What we saw and I think what we said, is that in the quarter there were some volume impacts from competitive bidding. I mean that’s clear. As a patient is moving from HME A to HME B and that asset is picked up, you know if they were on a replenishment cycle that was every three months and then they are changing from HME A to HME B over a three months or a six months process, that maybe one of those masks in terms of the pickup or one of those cushions in terms of the pickup is left out. So that temporary distraction is real for competitive bidding and will have an impact on market price within a particular period of time, for a particular DME. But to ramp that up over the 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs out there in the U.S. marketplace, it's really difficult to know exactly, you know precisely pick where that volume change is occurring. But the leading indicators of patient flow into the channel are there. The analogy that we used at JPMorgan last week is it's like you have got a garden hose, where the garden hose is the flow of patients is the water, and the garden hose has got a crimp in it, which is this competitive bidding. And it's a [indiscernible] bend in the curve of the pipe. And we starting to work with our HMEs to uncrimp or unkink that garden hose and the water is starting to flow. So the patients are starting to come through the channel and they will get to an HME. The new HMEs that are establishing in the areas where they have won have to establish referral pathways and pick up those patients. And even established HMEs have to ensure those referral pathways are solid. But as we look to the long-term, we see getting back to that 6% to 8% market growth rate as something we will absolutely do. This is not a structural change, it's a temporary change that will allow us to help the customers and get us back to growth.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Mick, I guess my second question would be, as the HME customers obviously have seen their profitability tighten, they are clearly coming back at you guys and asking for concessions. You competitors are responding, you are not going to respond to them more aggressively, you are not going to give us pricing information anymore which I understand. But shouldn’t we assume that this is a more permanent dynamic on the pricing side and that the volume as they come back over the course of time with the new patient flow that the structural growth rate has to be lower than it was before.
Michael Farrell: So I will hand to Jim to go in a little more detail on the profitability of the HME customers and then I will come back to talk to your point about long-term and why I think we can get back to the 6% to 8%. Jim?
James Hollingshead: Hi, Ben. I don’t think the market dynamic that we are seeing now is a permanent market dynamic. I mean that’s your question. I think what we are seeing, we have been talking internally about how to describe what we see going in the market, and the metaphor that we keep coming back to is, it's like a thunderstorm has passed through town. The storm is through but there is cleanup, right. And so -- and talking to our customers what we are seeing, we have talked about in this call before, is the things that our customers have to go through with doing subcontracting, and a lot of the larger customers are doing acquisitions, and as they do that they are buying a -- they are either buying a business whole or they are buying a list of patients. They then have to figure out how to get those patients in their replenishment systems and so on. There is a lot of logistics and administration that is working its way through the HME world right now. There is pricing pressure, there is clearly pricing pressure. And as Joann said earlier, you have seen that in all the competitive bid markets. But I don’t think there is any reason to believe that what's going on right now is just sort of a new normal that will last forever. I think the market is working its way through what we have previously described as distraction. And I think over the next several months, and it makes very difficult to know how long that timeframe is, but over the next several months we will see it stabilize. So, no, I don’t think this kind of challenge is a permanent challenge. I think we have to work our way through it as an industry and we are working with our customers to do that.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company: Right. And, Jim, what I was trying to get at is that I think the value proposition for a user in a lower reimbursement environment to the HME is more compressed and so they are going to be more price sensitive to the higher end products or to any product, and less willing to step up on the mix side which is a structural change versus the ability you have had in the past to keep moving that mix a little bit higher and holding price as a result. That’s what I am concerned about.
Michael Farrell: I think the mix dynamic is still there, Ben, and here is why. The CPAP to APAP mix shift is still going even despite the compounding of the two effects. We talked about competitive bidding and the volume impact, the competitors actions and the pricing impact. So all that hit at once. Yet, still, we see some growth there for us. And as we are partnering with our customers to try and understand how to make that happen, the move to HST is implied. And we said somewhere between 30% to 35% of the tests, the diagnostic tests done in the U.S. were home sleep tests in the last 12 months. That will get to 40% within the next nine months. And it will then go to 45% and up and beyond. And we have said it many times, that the analogy is some markets in Europe, where you are talking about 70%-80% of the test being home sleep tests. This is sort of endpoint. That drives volume into the market. It allows more patients to get into the diagnostic channel who man not have gone to a PSG. This is all being driven by the insurance companies and payers but it has a benefit of providing more volume as a long-term. And the positive mix-shift, to your point on pricing, that allows that CPAP to APAP mix shift to happen. Additionally, for ResMed, as we start to launch more of our respiratory care products that we are launching in Europe and also launching in the Americas over the coming year or two, will have a mix shift for ResMed that allows us to move to higher end products. Where ASPs are just higher and there is mix shift from segment A to segment B that is a positive tailwind for us. So that’s why as we look at the market and as we look at our opportunities, we think a 6% to 8% market growth rate makes a whole lot of sense. But going from the global macro, I will drill back down to your question which is on the Americas. Jim, do you have any more to add there?
James Hollingshead: Yes, thank you, Mick. I just wanted to add one thing to that, Ben, which is, what we are seeing is actually what we have anticipated happening in the market. Which is as HMEs are working through the challenges that reimbursement cuts have posed for them, there is pricing pressure and that makes sense to us, but they are also looking for more efficiencies in their business. And so they are looking to a couple of things. Everybody wants to drive up their compliance rate and that actually works in our favor because our products have higher compliance, both on flow gen and on mask. The other thing they are looking to do is to get each patient compliant and then to get them into replenishment programs in the cost effective way. So that’s why you have been seeing us focus on some of the [indiscernible] You have seen us improve EasyCare Online platform. You have seen us with our [indiscernible] subsidiary driving some automation into the business process. And you will continue to see things like that from us over the coming months. We are working with our customers -- you know our products still get a premium. They get a premium because they are better products but we continue to enjoy good position with the customers because we are helping to drive efficiencies into their business. And so we are very bullish on where we are taking our offering in that direction.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Matthew Prior of Bank of America.
Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question in regards to the exit trajectory from the quarter. Mick, you spoke about, obviously, this being a question of months not necessarily quarters, in terms of when we see those green shoots having benefit. But in terms of the three months of the quarter can you talk us through, given the last six months of seeing the impact of competitive bidding, was September the darkest month of the six? To give us a sense as to how that line would look over the six months.
Michael Farrell: Yes. To determine the exact trajectory of this combines a whole bunch of factors across 4000 to 6000 customers, and as they look at their patient referrals in and as they look at subcontracting, as they look at building facilities, and as they look at developing new organic referral pathway. So to pick down exactly where the nadir is and when the curve starts to move up, is very difficult. And that’s why we are here saying, look, it's going to be a number of months for us to get through this and we don’t know exactly how many. You know by customer of course you have all the dynamics going on, but if customer A buys customer B than one has a 100 percent growth, they are doubling, and the other is going to zero. Yet, the volume remains the same. So putting that across the whole weighted average of our customers is a difficult equation. And then you are predicting other market dynamics as to who is going to be better at developing referral models to cardiologists or to new pulmonary referral sources, or within the U.S. market as the development of the accountable care organizations or ACOs, where hospitals and primary care physicians are now working together with shared costs. You have other dynamics of cost and volume that go in on a market-by-market basis. So predicting exactly where the bottom is and how many months it is to see the trajectory moving up is very, very difficult, Matt.
Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, I guess to clarify, Mick, what I was really after was, do you think that second quarter is the worst that we have seen in terms of all the dynamics going on around price and competitive effect and irrationality out in the marketplace, and behavior of DMEs and disruption of patients finding equipment? Is it just a question of the rate of exit in terms of things get better from here or given the dynamics are still in flux, could we see, obviously, another quarter of weaker performance than what we have seen? I am trying to get a sense as to the dynamics you have seen, how long have they been going on to the extent of could things get worse from here, or is it just a question of the rate of trajectory out of the quarter?
Michael Farrell: Yes. You listed about 15 things which we are trying to predict all of them as we go forward. And to say precisely on all those 15, we don’t know. Here is the thing we can control. We can control our new product launch. And we just launched the AirFit P10, which in its first two weeks if flying off the shelf. We will be launching two other new masks between here and June 30 that similarly have huge opportunities for value generation. For patients, providers and for physicians. And we are also launching, I would call a leapfrog next-generation respiratory care system that I might ask Geoff Neilson to talk about some of its value as we have started to get our first patients on therapy in Europe for. So we know that we have the pipeline to start delivering and turning to strong growth here, and to get back to share gain in some of the categories like nasal masks and nasal pillows. And then also in the CPAP category with regard to appropriate pricing. So we have got the plan of action ready to go. And I will go back to what I said in the early notes when I said at the start of your question, Matt, which is, it's a number of months for us to get back to that growth trajectory but there a number of bits in play. Some are macroeconomic that we can't control. Some are directly within our control, like delivery of products. And we have done a pretty darn good job over the last two plus decades on that and we plan to execute on that over the coming 6-12 and beyond.
Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Mick, understood. My second question is in regards to France. You know given the changes to reimbursement there and obviously informatics. Have you seen anything in terms of the second quarter around mask consumption relating to those informatics in France in terms of that shift that has occurred?
Michael Farrell: I will hand to Rob Douglas to talk about that France and the HI.
Robert Douglas: Yes, thanks, Mick. Matt, the French business has been going well. We are encouraged by the performance of our system, our online system and how we are picking up all the patient numbers and managing the data. And also compiling with all of the privacy rules and that type of thing, which are quite complex throughout Europe. We think that’s performing well. In terms of, other sort of structural changes in terms of mask usage and things like that, it's still too early days to make a comment on that. But we are pretty happy with the way the French business has been going in the light of those changes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Low of Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: If we just switch in to the rest of world [indiscernible] right there. Mick, you began talking about that you think market growth could be 6% to 8% again. Help us understand why rest of world growth, constant-currency growth, I think is 5% versus that 6% to 8%. What's holding back that business or perhaps the market outside the U.S. at the moment?
Michael Farrell: Yes. So, David, the line was cutting in and out a little bit, but you were asking about Europe, Asia and rest of the world growth and who to get that to the 6% to 8% range. Look there are many impacts that are -- I mean counties obviously when we say Europe, Asia and rest of the world. We are talking about the other 99 countries we are in other than the U.S. But within those markets there are many different market dynamics. We talked in some detail in the call earlier about Japan being soft in Q1 and also being soft in Q2. We think there is some tailwind for us potentially in Asia Pac as we look to Q3 and Q4. So that has an opportunity to get us back to stronger growth rates and we think that can help get the rest of world number to where it should be. Look, I got to tell you, I was incredibly impressed by our European team. We don’t breakdown the particular countries within the Europe or the particular countries within Asia Pac. But there was some really good performances, particularly in Northern Europe, within our teams of partnering with insurance systems. Understanding the total value of the healthcare system and how ResMed takes patients with providers. Takes patients out a hospital, puts them in the home, and treats them more cost effectively and saves money for the healthcare system. And when you have socialized medicine and governments involved in healthcare, as you do in northern Europe, they'd very heavily involved in analyzing all that. So we have a lot of partnerships in the U.K. and Northern Europe that are moving us down that road and we are very excited about it. So as we look to that long-term and talk about 6% to 8% market growth. And do I feel confident that our Europe, Asia, and rest of the world group can achieve in that range, I absolutely do. We have got the right strategy, we have got the right people, and they are starting to execute on it. There will always be some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter but as you look forward over 4, 8, 12 quarters, we can absolutely see our growth being very solid within that range.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks very much. And just coming back to the U.S. Trends in the mix shift through auto setting devices and then bilevel devices. I know you have mentioned it particularly the gross margin, but just wondering with this move to competitive bidding and DMEs being under pressure, are you seeing any sort of pushback towards a basic CPAP where in the past you were seeing a trend to auto setting devices?
Michael Farrell: Look, this is all being driven by the payer and insurance companies, right. When they move the market from PSG to HST, they are driving it. And so when the payer establishes a home sleep testing protocol, it's going to require that the device that goes out is an APAP. Because otherwise you have to bring them back into the lab to get them titrated. So payers are generally driving the HST shift. They are also then driving the APAP shift. So that’s just a fact. It's going to happen. The bilevel opportunity is really about a broader opportunity which is about non-invasive ventilation. And the idea there is bringing something that’s been pretty well established in Western Europe, which is using non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, to bring more of that and to grow that category within the Americas market. I am going to ask Geoff Neilson to talk a little bit about our global respiratory care business and how that might apply to allow us to get some of that positive mix shift in our ventilators.
Geoff Neilson: So if we take COPD as an example, you know bilevel treatment for COPD in Europe is well established, particularly in Germany and ResMed is competing well in that space. There is a huge opportunity for COPD globally, including in the U.S. But it's somewhat muted by the reimbursement pathways to actually get patients on to therapy. However, on the other side, that has created some larger opportunities around higher-end ventilation products for COPD. And that’s a segment that should really be growing quickly. So that brings me into the our ventilation platform, which can be positioned for COPD in the U.S. and also globally across the range for life-support and ventilation. So our Astro platform, we have started market trials in Europe. So we have had significant number of patients on that device now. It's being incredibly well received. As Mick mentioned there, this is a leapfrog platform that was developed from scratch over the past year and we are looking forward to launching that globally, but certainly in Europe by the end of this fiscal year. And depending on FDA timing and so on, as soon as we have a 510(k) approval, we will route further up our ventilation sales force in the U.S. and start driving into that couple of hundred million dollar market with this product, which is replacing our Elisée and VS ranges [ph].
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of UBS.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Actually, just to take up that point on ventilation. You mentioned it's been growing quickly and I know you don't break it out at the quarter. But could you just characterize it at the quarter? Was it actually growing and did it contribute to growth in this quarter?
Michael Farrell: Yes. So Andrew we don’t break out ventilation and we will, as Geoff talked to, it's a material opportunity for us, but not yet by country and by segment a material business that we will break out as yet. But we are very excited about that product launch. And you know over the coming quarter, two or three, we will start to go into more detail as to the product launch and how that moves over time. We are already quite well established respiratory care player in some countries in Europe. So the product will roll into an existing referral and sales channel that we have already developed. In other markets, as Geoff was talking about the U.S. market and some others globally, we are developing the referral channels and the pipeline as well as bringing the product to market. So it's an S curve that will go rapidly in some countries and slowly in other countries. But specially to your question, Andrew, we are not going to break out the details in Q2 but as we look to going forward we will give more details of the products as it's launched in each of the different geographies worldwide.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Okay, and just with the masks, I think going into this quarter, you would have full contribution from the Quattro full face Air and the Swift Nano FX. Obviously from the quarters, there is a lot of noise in the numbers, pretty difficult to understand sort of what traction you're getting. Could you just again characterize what they might have been doing on an underlying basis?
Michael Farrell: Yes. So Quattro Air was launched sort of mid-calendar year. So we are in month five or six of that. We are actually seeing in the full face category, we are doing pretty well and Quattro Air is a strong part of that. And we like what Quattro Air is doing and customers seem to like the fact that it's 3.3 ounces and incredibly light on the face for the category of patients, the segment of patients that it's able to treat, the Quattro Air is doing well. Having said that, the Mirage Quattro and the Quattro FX, the other two full face masks we have are also holding share quite well. So we are reasonably comfortable with those. The Swift FX Nano has had a good start up, particularly in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. I mean masks were up, 6% headline and 4% constant currency in rest of the world. So the Swift FX Nano has started to have a pull up. But it was launched in the September timeframe in the U.S. and a little later in Europe so we haven't seen as much material contribution from that in the nasal category. But we are looking forward to that over time. But we are also, Andrew, looking very much forward to the next two masks and what contribution they are going to bring as we look forward.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Okay, and just a final bit of housekeeping. Just going to ask the FX contribution to EPS, and I think we got that number here from Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Andrew that was $0.05 this quarter, the EPS impact.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Abbott of Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs: My first one is around share loss in masks. Do you think you're losing share just in new patients or do you think there is some spillover into existing patients?
Michael Farrell: So as you know we don’t sell directly to patients so we don’t have any idea as to whether it's a new patient or an existing patient. In the U.S. market we sold to distributors who move that forward. As we look at the temporary distraction from competitive bidding impacting as well as the competitor actions of new product launches, particularly in nasal masks and nasal pillows categories. There is a whole combination of factors going on there. It's very difficult to discern that. And underlying fundamental is that it is difficult to switch existing patients out. So like a comfortable pair of jeans or a pair of shoes that you love wearing, you tend to stick to the same ones. It's difficult to get a patient, particularly something they were every night if they are comfortable and happy. Firstly, you probably don’t want to do it if you are physician or a patient. And then even the provider who might have some margin gain. The margin gain of that versus the margin loss of potentially losing the patient to another HME or not being able to switch the patient and spending the cost to do so, generally means that they are not switched as often. Having said that, we believe that the new products, the three new products that we are bringing out this fiscal year, the AirFit P10 and the two others, will allow us to get back to rapid gain of new patients and establish therefore installed base that should be a replenishment for years to come on that basis.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs: Great, and my second question was around the cost side of things. You have raised your guidance on SG&A from 28% to 29%. R&D, you pushed the guidance just to a straight 8%, previously 7% to 8%. Is that a function of higher investment or is that more a function of lower expected sales outlook? And I suppose if there is, if it's the latter, I'm just wondering how much ability is there to start to trim those expenses and how long would that take?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Ian, there is rough estimates or a range where we think it will be. So I mean that can easily move around from that number so it's not kind of, probably not the precision that you are thinking about. We have got this pipeline through on product and so on so you can expect R&D will really, I think to some extent a factor of a pretty solid pipeline in R&D that we are undertaking. And also we are taking a foot off in terms of R&D and what we are doing there. And in SG&A we need to contain those. I think we have done a reasonable job and we will continue to make sure we are spending effectively and efficiently. But we will certainly be investing in some of these newer growth areas around respiratory care, around cardiology. Geoff mentioned earlier in terms of ramping up, for example, in the sales force in the U.S. when the time is appropriate to support sales there. So there is a number of those programs or projects that we definitely want to support. But notwithstanding that, clearly we want to continue to leverage on SG&A and make sure we are driving R&D expenditure efficiently. So we will continue to do that. So the short answer, yes, I think there is scope that I think that we can continue to be effective in those areas and drop that benefit to the bottom line.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse: Mick, just two questions. First one is, I think in your opening remarks you spoke to what was happening on the competitive dynamics on the CPAP side of the business. I assume you were referring to fixed pressure devices. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to what you are seeing there, whether it's share loss as opposed to just competitive pricing and just what your response is to that? And the second question is, just with regards to your customer, well, to your DME customers, whether you are actually seeing any consolidation yet, actual closures of particularly small to medium-sized players? Thanks.
Michael Farrell: It sounds like a U.S. folks [ph] question. Jim, you want to address that too?
James Hollingshead: Sure, I shall. So, yes, the CPAP dynamic that Mick was referring to in the opening comments was about the fix pressure devices. What we are seeing is continued growth in the AutoSet or APAP part of the market. There is a mix shift underway across the whole markets. AutoSet where we continue to do well. In CPAP what we are seeing is increased pricing pressure, especially at the low end. That is a decreasing part of the market. So the low-end CPAP is actually a smaller part of the market than mid-tier CPAP which is, it's about smaller than AutoSet. And that we are seeing more severe pricing pressure at the low-end. So we have lost some share and there is pressure down in that part of the market. And as we said in the opening comment, we are looking hard at how we want to be positioned in that space in terms of -- we have a great offering, we are looking hard how we want to be positioned as the category declines and we see pricing pressure there.
Michael Farrell: And the second one was with regard to DME customers and consolidation. And on that one, Saul, clearly we have -- 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs in the U.S. market. There are some changes as we talked about as we go through. I liked the analogy of the storm going through and it's led some order there. There is some cleanup there and there will be some consolidation and we have seen, and some of that has been public of some of these companies selling their assets from company A to company B. And the fundamental is that the patients are there, the volume is there and it will increase over the coming years. And so to what extent there is consolidation, we can't precisely tell but we are working with those who won bids within the competitive bidding environment and those who are bidding on the future. And as we look around the HME landscape, there are definitely signs of an HME that is planning for future growth. If an HME is investing in EasyCare Online, is driving usually to drive patient engagement and get patients adherent to care. And if an HME is using our electronic data in the change and programs to say, use our billing systems, such as say Brightree, where you can do a one stop shop and click to purchase ResMed products. Then they are thinking about efficiency, they are thinking about scale, they are thinking about cost and they are thinking about the long-term. And they are the type of HMEs that we are spending a lot of time working with to say what's an appropriate price premium for our products and what value will it drive for you in the market over the next 6, 12, 24 months. And we are working through all that. So we are very confident that we are working with those who are investing in the long term for this industry and those who are preparing for the long-term growth that we see of patients coming through the channel. Both in sleep and in home care, respiratory care and as longer-term, as we are already doing in Europe and Japan, in the cardiorespiratory space.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben Haynor of Feltl and Company.
Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company: Just had a bit of a mechanics question on product introductions. When you introduce, say a new mask, do you typically see larger stocking orders to the DMEs and HMEs when the product is first introduced than you might see in subsequent quarters? Or is the reorder rate often enough where that doesn't factor in?
Michael Farrell: Yes, Ben, it's more often than not it's an S curve that goes up over time. There is not usually large lump at the start, it's more around spending time with the physicians, spending time with the providers, and spending time working with the channel to help get them familiar with the benefits of a new mask. For instance the AirFit P10, being 50% quieter and 50% lighter, you have to sit down there with the doctor and explain and show the benefits for it. And I think there is some early clinical data and a white paper showing, a patient gets 40 minutes more of sleep from that product, for instance. So you then need to talk to the physician and get them onboard with that. You have to talk to the provider to make sure it's on their schedule and negotiate pricing and so on. So it you like, it's an S curve with a bit of lag at the start, but then acceleration from there rather than the other way around.
Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company: Okay, great. So with a product like the AirFit P10, we should expect to see that go up the S-curve as time goes on?
Michael Farrell: Correct.
Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company: Okay. Great, well, congrats on that product. It seems like it is blowing the doors off.
Operator: And we are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks.
Michael Farrell: Well, thank you. And as always, I would like to say thanks to all of you on this conference call for your interest and support of ResMed. Most importantly, I would like to thank the global ResMed team for our focus on improving the lives of patients, one breath at a time. We are about 7.5 million patients improved over the last 12 months. I couldn’t thank you enough. Thanks a lot. Bye bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Q1 2014 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maisha. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.
Constance C. Bienfait: Thank you, Maisha, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you can access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. [Operator Instructions] Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team here present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, go ahead.
Michael J. Farrell: Great. Thanks, Connie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q1, and then hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail. So first, the financial summary. Global revenue in Q1 of fiscal 2014 grew 5% year-on-year, to $358 million, that's up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Americas revenue grew 4% to $202 million. Europe, Asia and the rest of the world headline revenue increased 7% for the quarter, which is 5% growth in constant currency terms. We believe the overall global growth of the industry remained steady at 6% to 8%, with global flow generator growth in the 4% to 6% range and global Mask category growth at approximately 8% to 10%. Net income for the quarter increased 14% to $81 million, while earnings per share increased 14% to $0.56 for the quarter. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the team. I'm going to start with an overview on Europe, where we saw a strong regional growth, with solid performance in many countries, including France -- particularly France, the U.K., as well as Switzerland. Both our German homecare business and our German dealer business also grew strongly. The European results were driven by strength in both flow generators and Masks. One of the main drivers of flow generator growth in Europe was the AutoSet CS product. This product includes the proprietary PaceWave algorithm that is designed for congestive heart failure patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration, amongst others. We also saw strong growth in our Respiratory Care products throughout Europe, including continued adoption of our Stellar ventilation platform. Mask growth was also solid across the European region, with both the Quattro Air and the Swift FX Nano masks being well received across the region. In France, the government confirmed during the quarter that its telemonitoring requirements would take effect right at the start of this quarter, on October 1. We believe that this announcement during the quarter dispelled any confusion in the homecare provider space in France, and will help ResMed grow its share in both the flow generator and the emerging healthcare informatics space in France, as well as across Europe. We are starting to see success in the way we position EasyCare Online solutions for monitoring requirements, not only in France, but also in other parts of Europe. Building on the strength in the U.S., this is becoming a global trend. We expect that success to continue. We announced on our website today that we have acquired an Eastern European-based distributor of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as respiratory care products. The acquisition is in Poland, the country with a population of around 40 million, and a gross domestic product of around USD 490 billion. This acquisition strengthens our presence in Eastern Europe, allowing us to expand ResMed's reach to help more patients with access to comfortable and effective treatment for respiratory disorders and also, to be able to more closely support the local homecare provider networks in developing respiratory care, as well as cardiorespiratory markets. This acquisition is an element of our ongoing global emerging market growth strategy. In the Asia Pacific region, sales were lumpy, influenced by our business primarily in Japan. The long-term opportunities in this region remain incredibly strong, especially in our emerging markets -- growth opportunities in this region, with a focus particularly on China, as well as India. In the Americas, we saw steady 5% flow generator growth, knowing that we were up against a very tough prior year comparison. Flow generators were up 17% in Q1 fiscal 2013, and we hit 5% in Q1 2014. This 5% increase is in line with market growth, which we said is around 4% to 6%. We are holding share in this category. The strong mix shift from CPAP to APAP was evident again as the trend to home sleep testing continues to drive this mix shift. The S9 AutoSet remains our flagship product in this region, and it is growing well. We're seeing a trend that new patient growth is very solid in the U.S. And we attribute some of the growth that is part of that trend to the increased availability of home sleep testing. We estimate that approximately 35% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests are now with HST. This is driven primarily by payer mandates. We also think that HST will grow in the next 12 months to around 40% to 45% of all tests done within the U.S. Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. We think it's around 55%, based on our latest sleep lab survey data, but sleep labs are really engaging in HST and looking to offer it as a choice to patients. And we're partnering with our sleep labs to help provide our ApneaLink services, our VPAP Tx services and other services that can help them diagnose patients. In terms of Respiratory Care devices in the Americas, we are seeing positive early trends with our VPAP ST-A and our VPAP COPD products. You'll remember VPAP COPD was just recently launched. Both of these are now on the S9 platform. These products have a long lead sales cycle, and we expect this growth to continue over the coming quarters and beyond. We are taking share in the respiratory care space, and these products are positive margin contributors. We believe regulatory approval of the Stellar product in Brazil is imminent, and we expect that this will be a great geographic market for growth, given its particular homecare ventilation needs in that geography. We are making good progress on our Respiratory Care pipeline, and we plan to launch a new Respiratory Care platform for patients in fiscal year 2014. Masks in the Americas were up against a tough year-on-year comparison. Masks, if you remember, grew 13% year-on-year in Q1 fiscal 2013. We acknowledge that we lost share in this quarter due to a competitive product cycle, particularly in the nasal category and, to a lesser extent, in the pillows category. We held share in the full face category, helped by initial momentum from the launch of Quattro Air. It was released late in the fourth quarter. As I stated in our press release, the Quattro Air is on its way to being one of our best mask product launches ever. And there's lots of runway left for that product. We're only 90 days in. We also launched the Swift FX Nano in the U.S. during September, which is just a couple of weeks ago, the last month, obviously, of the quarter. The Nano has a low-profile nasal cushion, minimal headgear, and we expect the Nano to help get us back on the front foot in the nasal category. We have had a leading position in the masks space for many years and we will maintain that. We obviously expect competition in this space, and we expect customers to sample new competitive products. The increasing competition, in fact, in the nasal and pillow categories demonstrates that the market continues to look for, and reward, new product innovation, despite the ongoing reimbursement pressures. We think that's good for our business because innovation is our strong suit. We have an incredibly exciting pipeline of innovative new masks across all the categories coming out over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond, with one mask launch, literally, just around the corner. There's been a round of competitive bidding launched on July 1, the first day of the quarter that we're talking through here, Q1. And that caused some distraction, as we've talked about, for our U.S. channel in the quarter. Our HME customers had new reimbursement rates that were announced in February but went into effect on July 1. Remember, CB 2 is a significant part of Medicare, which is around 25% of the HME payer portfolio in the U.S. market. HMEs who won new CB 2, or competitive bidding 2 -- I'll use CB 2 as an abbreviation in this call, contracts in geographies where they didn't have a brick-and-mortar presence now have to set up subcontracts. HMEs who won CB 2 in areas where they have an established presence now have to collect paperwork on the new Medicare patients and establish replenishment programs for those new patients. HMEs who lost contracts in CB 2 are now working on driving new referrals for commercial payers, which is the other 75% of their payer portfolio, and on subcontracting partnerships for the 25%, that is CB 2. It looks to us that CB 2 has temporarily impacted volumes in the U.S. market, but as that distraction clears, volumes will pick up to meet the ongoing growth in patient demand. As I said earlier, we have seen new patient growth that is solid, and the underlying fundamental patient dynamic of home sleep testing is driving that. And the fact that 85% of this most penetrated of our markets, which is the U.S., 85% of the patients still need to be diagnosed and treated. That's a lot of runway ahead of us. We continue to see the trends that sleep-disordered breathing and COPD prevalence, awareness and patient referrals are all growing. It's notable that in the Round One Recompete bid that was announced during Q1, the reimbursement rates for sleep and respiratory care products increased versus CB 2. We believe this is a very good indicator. With CB 2 rates and contracts now in effect, and have been in effect for over 90 days, we're encouraged that uncertainty is receding and customers are focusing on how to succeed in this new environment. We're partnering with our HME customers and helping them take cost out of our mutual supply chain and out of the system. Our solutions include EasyCare Online, U-Sleep, electronic data interchange, replenishment optimization, drop ship programs, PCP awareness, and patient engagement programs and more in the healthcare informatics space. As a particular example in the healthcare informatics management space, we announced an alliance at Medtrade during the quarter with Brightree. Brightree is a cloud-based software development company. The ResMed online store will now be integrated with Brightree's HME management solutions, simplifying the ordering process for our mutual HME customers. So HME customers who use Brightree's systems will be able to order ResMed products with a single login and access to inventory availability data directly in their own management systems. This makes it easier to do business with ResMed and it makes it more cost efficient to do business with ResMed. Brightree's share of the healthcare informatics space is somewhere in the 30% to 40% range, we believe, in the HME management solutions based in the U.S. As an example of patient engagement programs, we just crossed over the 1-year anniversary mark for our Wake Up to Sleep offering. Wake Up to Sleep is ResMed's comprehensive sleep apnea support community. It's intended to help people along their entire sleep-disordered breathing journey from awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment, to ongoing adherence. There are already multiple tens of thousands of people signed up for the program, which focuses on the lifelong value to the patient. Once engaged, Wake Up to Sleep helps patients through their journey, and helps them maximize adherence. This benefits the patient, but it also benefits the physician, the HME provider and the payer. Finally, on the intellectual property front, we were just designated by an independent IP firm, Intellectual Asset Management, as the leading global company in the Asia Pacific region with, in their words, "world-class IP functions and strategies and strong IP protection." So ResMed is seen by them as a truly global IP player committed to asserting its IP rights. We've demonstrated this by defending and protecting our intellectual property and our solid R&D investments over the years, with lawsuits against both APEX and BMC. Let me wrap up with this. Our respiratory medical market is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with our customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers, physicians and payers to help manage outcomes of chronic disease. This solutions approach applies in our core market of sleep-disordered breathing, but it also applies in our growing Respiratory Care business, as well as in our fast-growing cardiorespiratory business. For these 3 horizons of growth, the combination of our world-leading quality flow generators, as well as the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems on the planet, as well as easy-to-access, robust and actionable software solutions, makes ResMed the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new products in both devices, as well as in masks, as well as in future business process innovations that are planned for sleep, Respiratory Care and cardiology. We are laser-focused on bringing these innovative solutions to our market, and we're managing the fundamentals of our business. Those fundamentals are that we continue to improve patients' quality of life, we continue to prevent disease progression, and we continue to reduce the burden of health care costs for critical, chronic diseases, such as sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and heart failure. Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter were $357.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 4%. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.9 million, an increase of 20% over the prior-year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $80.9 million, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56 for the quarter, again, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 63.7%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to Q1 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.3%, compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of $0.28 for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.4 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. While in constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 9%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 8%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 21.6%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $201.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $156.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $112.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting a very competitive market, particularly in the nasal and pillow segments. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $103.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Masks and other sales were $53 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 4%, while Masks and other also increased by 4%. Cash flow from operations was $90.4 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $17.9 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 432,000 shares for consideration of $21.1 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 4.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. We plan to repurchase at least 2 million shares during fiscal year 2014. In addition to the buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $616 million, and at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is Andrew Goodsall with UBS.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Could I, perhaps, just dig in a little bit to the U.S. flow generators, of course, and just ask you to clarify your comments or elaborate on your comments around volume and price? You mentioned it being weaker sort of in volumes or disruption, I think, through the bidding process?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Andrew, so there was some temporary distraction that we talked about from the CB 2 rates that we saw in Q1. The Americas' flow generators growth was 5% year-on-year, which is in the middle of that 4% to 6% range that we think is around that. So reasonably solid growth from us, but in looking at our partners, our HME's business and working with them, we noticed some distraction in, as we said, the contracts from the winners, the subcontracting from the nonwinners and the relationships that have to happen in terms of getting both prescriptions and referrals for patients who were on the replenishment programs for -- who transferred from nonwinners to winners. So all that together caused some temporary distraction during the quarter, and we think that's had some effect on the flow generator growth of the market. And we did reasonably well, I think, in terms of holding our share in a pretty tough quarter for that, where we hit 5%.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And just when we look at that 5%, can you elaborate any further on mix, on what was price versus volume? Because you have spoken to the impact of price on the group before?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So I mean, as we talked about on our last call in the intervening period, around 5% to 7% is the sort of year-on-year price reductions that we've seen. If you remember, last call, we talked about 4% to 6%. So that's a delta of 100 basis points. We think that is temporary and associated with the distraction that happened particularly in the U.S. market. And that 5% to 7% can possibly go back to the 4% to 6%. And we think that will happen as the distraction clears. So without, Andrew, breaking out the specifics of exactly what unit volumes are, which we never do here, and we just talk about revenue growth, that 5% number has sort of all those factors weighed into it.
Operator: Our next question is Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: The question I guess, for me, first off, is talk a little bit about the revenue that you might be getting from ventilators and ventilatory kind of masks in the quarter in the United States? And kind of break that out, if you can, to give us a kind of raw sleep number, if that's relevant. And then second, just on the currency side, for Brett, if rates hold steady, what do you expect for the quarter and the year?
Michael J. Farrell: So I'll take the first part and Brett will take the second. But it will be a quick answer, Ben, we're not going to break out Respiratory Care versus sleep. We're just going to keep flow gens versus masks. Brett, do you want to take the second part?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, I do. I mean, the currency impact obviously benefited on the gross margin with the currency this quarter. And if I look -- if you look through from Q1 into Q2, I still think we'll see some favorable benefits there, and I'd estimate probably -- it's probably going to be in the order of 70 basis points, if currencies hold. Go in [ph] with caution, as all these crept up a bit over the quarter. If you looked in -- for the gain in the Q2, Q3, then you'd see something like half of that 70 basis points reversing back into -- in Q3. So we're going a long way out in terms of predicting on currencies. But if you think about it, Q2 will still see some favorable benefits from currency, then if you watch into Q3, that'd probably, on a sequential basis, reverse a little bit. But looking -- kind of underlying theme of favorability from currency movement, I think we're still going to see that play out on the bottom line in the next few quarters.
Operator: Our next question is David Low with Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just touching on masks. I mean, mask resupply and the growth in the number of masks per patient has been a big trend in recent years. I was wondering if you could, one, comment on that; and two, just comment on whether you're seeing much brand change or seen patients changed the mask model they use once they already establish the user of CPAP?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, David. The mask resupply has been, and will continue to be, a strong element of growth long-term for the industry. We partnered very closely, particularly in the U.S. market, with our customers to help drive replenishment programs, really, over the last 3, 5 years, and even beyond that in terms of helping them access their patients, understand adherence rates, understand the importance of that for keeping the patients out of hospital, saving money for the health care system. And that is good for the patient, it's good for the payer and it's good for the provider. So there's a good incentive for all the parties involved. And we've seen that grow really well, as you have, over the quarters. We think that trend will absolutely continue and we will be a part of it. Clearly, in Q1, we did not grow as fast as we'd like to in the nasal and -- particularly, the nasal category but also somewhat in the pillows category. With the launch of the Swift FX Nano, we're back on the front foot in the nasal category. And that's got an S-curve to go up. But as I said in my opening remarks, we have 3 great masks coming out across the categories over the next 3, 6, 9 months. And we believe that those will get us on the front foot for the new patient setup. On the second part of your question about switching patients, masks tend to be like those really comfortable pair of jeans or those really comfortable pair of shoes where it's hard to get someone to change. And if they change, they often buy the same pair of jeans or the same pair of shoes that they were wearing before. And it's difficult to get patients to switch. We think that fundamental is still there. And that's why it's all the more important for us to get these great new masks out and get back on the front foot for new patient setup because there's a trailing revenue opportunity and a trailing opportunity to really help the health care system by keeping those patients with masks for their lifetime.
Operator: Our next question is Saul Hadassin with Crédit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Mick, just a question on -- you mentioned the temporary disruption that you've seen post company, can you talk to how long you think that disruption's likely to last?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Saul. Yes, it's a temporary distraction in the U.S. market associated with CB2, right? So the U.S. market, which is 50% of the global, it's within that 25% that's [indiscernible] as Medicare. That temporary distraction -- how long is a piece of string? We don't have 100% knowledge on how long it'll take, but we believe it's a matter of months. It's not a matter of weeks. But it's not a matter of quarters. This is a matter of months and we think the U.S. customers have been dealing with this for, now, 90 -- across 20, we're talking about 110, 114 days now. It's not new to them, we've been partnering with them over this period. They know what the challenges are and they're working hard at getting all the paperwork sorted out, getting the subcontracts sorted out, getting the new prescriptions, getting the patients on their databases and working with them. And we are partnering with them -- as we said, with things like the Brightree to make it single order entry, single approach to 1 health care infomatic system to be able to order and resupply. So we think that, over the next number of months, we'll be able to help them through that process, and we're pretty confident in that. Jim, I don't know if you want to add a couple of comments, Jim Hollingshead, who is our President of the Americas, might add a couple of comments. He's closer to this.
James Hollingshead: Sure. I mean, to give you guys a sense of the scale of it, roughly half of competitive bid to contracts were won by HMEs who did not have physical facilities in the place where they wanted, right? And so as Mick referred to in the opening comments, that means that there's a lot of subcontracting arrangements that have to be worked out. And so if you just think that side of it alone -- just think of the contracts that had to be set up -- and the subcontracting model is actually new, for the most part, in the HME world. So there's a big administrative burden. Once you've figured out a model, you've got a lot of paperwork you've got to do and you've got arrangements, you have to set up around who owns the inventory and how does it get shipped and things like that. It creates an extra burden on top of, and parallel to, the reimbursement cuts. And so, how long will it take to work through? We see people working through it already. Our customers are very good business people. They have historically shown real resilience in dealing with administrative burden created by both government payers and, well, by Medicare and private payers. So we think we seen working through it now and we think it's probably months and not weeks, but it's not an all year thing. We think they'll clear it and we think they're working through it right now.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Again, just a follow-up question for Brett. Just wanted to ask where you are in terms of manufacturing production out of Singapore and where you think that might get to over the next 12 months or so?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, we're around the 60% mark. We're a little bit more on the Flow Gens, a little bit less on the Mask, but you can sort of blend it around the 60%, And I think, as we said before, I think we just progressively kind of lift that as our production increases. So, also, we predict exactly where we'll be, but that will certainly become a larger percentage of our manufacturing over time.
Operator: Our next question is Steve Wheen with JPMorgan.
Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on your rest-of-world numbers and Asia Pacific you referred to as being lumpy. Could you sort of give it a little bit more color as to what's happening there, and in particular, your reference to Japan? What is going on in that market?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, thanks for the questions, Steve. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer.
Robert Douglas: The Japan market has always been lumpy for us. Probably you're aware we've got just a few large customers there that run very significant home care businesses, and they replenish their fleet periodically. Tracking the underlying patient numbers and the whole progression of the sleep business there is progressing well. But order, timing and that just meant that we were in a low part of the lumpy run in Japan. We're very confident of the business there. We've got great relationships with our customers and our teams are working well together in serving those markets. That was really the main issue. The other smaller markets in Asia-Pac all did pretty well and we saw good growth through the emerging markets in there, but they're not yet material enough to show up on these numbers.
Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just also on France, the formalization of that, I guess, compliance regime. What sort of response are you seeing from the buyers in that market?
Michael J. Farrell: Okay, Steve. So we're 110 days in, and we think it's months away on CB2 lineup. We're 23 days in to the French announcement of the telemonitoring, and so 3 weeks -- Anne Reiser, who's our President of Europe, is all across this. She's actually our previous President of France, and ran that business since we hired her from Medtronic for almost a decade in sales and laying it [ph], so she knows the French market intimately. And we have good relations with both the authority and excellent relationships with our customers in France. And we have seen this coming and have been planning for it. We have had great learning from our U.S. market, with EasyCare Online now becoming the leader in healthcare informatics for the sleep disorder breathing space, and we have been able to scale that business very well over the last number of years in the U.S. So we have the systems, the tools and the scalable capabilities that we have now taken, literally, to within the country of France and availability now across the European Union. So it's early days. We think the customers are starting to get to grips around it and understanding how to work with us. We think it's going to be a benefit for the S9 order set, for the S9 order set with wireless capabilities and for our EasyCare Online solution in France. But, Steve, it's too early days to say how quickly that S-curve will start to happen, but the starting gun just went off.
Operator: Our next question is Matthew Prior with Bank of America.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mick, just a question, just peeling back the layers on CB a little bit further, the 100 basis points of discounting or price pressure that you saw since the last update. Can you give us a sense as to whether that was pressure from private insurers or payers? Or is that driven more from a competitive element, given that volumes are depressed from the distraction factor and various manufacturers fighting for volume?
Michael J. Farrell: Matthew, we don't have visibility into the exact per-customer, per-payer knowledge of our customers and so what we do is look at it as a portfolio. Clearly, globally, we saw 100 basis points with the 5% to 7% year-on-year price declines. So there's some impact there, but breaking it out between public and private is very high. What we know are the facts. The facts are that CB2 was announced in February, and went into play in July 1, and that's the main impact that's happened across that payer portfolio. There have been very minor changes in private payers that are not out of the ordinary in and what was happening over the last, not just 5 quarters, but 5 years. So I'm affected by CB or CB1 or CB2. So I'd say that you could deduce that, primarily, price changes were driven by CB2, but we don't have true visibility into it. So it's an assumption, but a pretty good one, based upon the data that we have in hand.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And just a follow-up question, I guess, for them all. Have you seen any change in competitive behavior, to the extent that, again, lower volumes from the distraction factor? Are all various manufacturers still behaving in the same manner which they've behaved, and that it gets around 1 in previous near quarters, given this backdrop of low-volume growth?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, look, I think the pricing behavior has been pretty steady in that 5% to 7% range. I mean, clearly, the new product introduction behavior is that there have been a number of new products introduced by, primarily, our 2 major competitors. Without going into detail, we talked about the nasal category and the pillows category being where they are looking to enter and the customers are sampling those products. We're very confident that not only the Quattro Air's success but Swift FX Nano's great start. And without going into detail, the pipeline that we have coming in the next 3, 6 to 9 months will get us back on the front foot for that first-time setup. So if I was to summarize competitive behavior, I'd say it's about innovation and it's about competition through small, acquired and more comfortable, and better for the patient. Because everyone is starting to realize that adherence is the outcome that matters. That's what saves money for the payer, it's what saves money for the employer and it's what benefits the patient directly each night. That level of competitive behavior of innovating on value, is something that we think is healthy for the industry, but we also think plays to our strong suit over the last couple of decades, and something that we are absolutely confident we can get back on the front foot.
Operator: Our next question is Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Can we spend a moment on gross margins? Which were pretty spectacular this quarter. How sustainable is that? And what drove almost 100 basis point uptick sequentially?
Michael J. Farrell: Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. I mean, the big one, sequentially, would have been FX impact. So, sequentially, that contributed around 90 basis points. So you think on that, that's basically most of that expansion, if you like. I mean, but if you're still looking at trend buys, we're still getting product mix benefits and things like CPAP to APAP, the Respiratory Care business, all those provide, if you like, sort of a bit of tailwind for us on the gross margin. And some geographic mix, there's some benefit around geographic mix this time around, which -- generally, we probably don't get to the same magnitude we got this time. So there's a few things playing out. The other one is on -- I mean, we're working really hard in the manufacturing and the cost outside of the business as well. And you're seeing that sort of manifest pretty consistently now through the gross margin, and we're absolutely committed to those programs. So, again, you'll see them flowing through as well. And what we're looking to do is -- and you've probably seen it here in the last year or 2 is really do enough through the product mix, through manufacturing logistics to offset the ASP decline.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, now I know you don't like to give revenue guidance, but given all of the pushes and takes that are happening in the first quarter, and quite frankly, the constant currency growth rate which is a meaningful step down from where you have been, can you comment on what you think your revenue may grow at, even if it's a range, for 2014?
Michael J. Farrell: No, Joanne, we don't give guidance on revenue. I'll reiterate our market guidance, that we believe that the global market will grow at 6% to 8%, Flow Generators will grow at 4% to 6%, and Masks will grow at 8% to 10%.
Operator: Next question is David Clair with Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I guess, just kind of a bigger picture one for me, but how do you defend your market share from lower-cost manufacturers and kind of the post-competitive bidding environment? At Medtrade that seems like a lot of kind of fringe players who are talking about this as an opportunity to take some share.
Michael J. Farrell: David, low-cost competition is nothing new in our industry. It's been around for over a decade. Many of the players at Medtrade are players who have been trying to enter this market and/or other markets. When I say this market, the one you're at, at Medtrade, the U.S. market and/or other markets around the world, for many years. And the way I'd look at it is if supply was unable to enter the Chinese market or the Brazilian market and their levels of focus on quality and cost trade-off, what are their chances in the U.S. market? So I think it comes back to the fundamentals. The fundamentals here are that health care systems are growing at a fast rate, relative to GDP, for every major developed country. And the U.S. is at 18% of its GDP on health care. Most of western Europe is somewhere in the 10% to 12% of its GDP on health care. Every healthcare system around the world is looking for outcomes and value, and that's driven by long-term adherence and reduction of cost with improvement of quality of life of the patient. We have focused very closely on this, and every new product we bring to market, every new solution we bring to market, looks to take cost out of the system and improve adherence rates for the patient, and reduce the long-term costs for payers and for employers. So, in that environment, with all that going on, I don't think a low-cost solution that has low value has a great opportunity to get into the market. We have great value, our products, at good value prices. So this is happening on a global scale. But I guess you were in the U.S. at Medtrade, maybe I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead to give some detail on what's happening in the U.S. market with those new entrants.
James Hollingshead: Well, the first thing -- I think it's a great question and I completely agree with Mick's answer. But if I just think, with our customers, right? The basic equation for our customers is they need products to work. So they need to be able to easily set up a patient. They need to be able to track the compliance of that patient, make sure the patient gets compliance and then create a resupply model. And so the better the product works, the better off they are. And our products work better than other products on the market. We have the best products on the market. Most of the low-cost sort of Asian entrants are producing products that really are not in that class. They don't work that well. They create cost at setup, they create lower compliance rates, et cetera. It's not a very good value proposition. Having said that, we're very mindful. I mean, we're watching the competitive set. And the key thing for us, over time, is to be able to continue to innovate with great product, which we have a great track record of doing, right? So that's it. Now, one of the things we found, and I was actually going to suggest we might turn to Dave to comment is the other issue was around our intellectual property. So, in this space, intellectual property is very strong. And as you guys know, we've defended our intellectual property against a couple of Asian entrants. And that's another way we defend. But I think that the basic way we defend is we have the great products that work that create more revenue for our customers.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, it's a good suggestion. Dave, you want to address the IP side and also to APEX and BMC deal?
David Pendarvis: Sure. So the key here is, when people come in to compete and they compete with using our intellectual property, we're not going to let it happen. So, whether that's a small competitor or whether it's a large competitor, we intend to enforce our intellectual property. And that's a different question from a small competitor who comes in and tries to compete using their own R&D, which obviously they've got to get off their own merit. But we're not going to hesitate to continue to enforce our intellectual property against market entrants who want to use the innovation of our hard working employees. And that's something we're continuing to fight with APEX and BMC on. We expect to continue to win those battles. And then at the same time, we expect to be able to be prepared to launch them if we need to. We prefer to see competitors respect our intellectual property and battle on the field. But if we need to battle in court, we won't hesitate to do that.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then in terms of the temporary distraction that you guys saw during the quarter, how would you -- would you kind of say that things started out badly in early July and it kind of got progressively better as the quarter rolled on or was it just kind of depressed throughout the quarter?
Michael J. Farrell: David, we have daily conversations with our customers. It's hard to get a read on this at that level of detail, but what I can say is the temporary distraction is receding, and it's a question on how fast it recedes. We're 111, 114 days in. It's better than 100 days in, it's better than 90 days in. And it's going in the right direction and we believe it will resolve over a matter of months. The exact kinetics of it, during the quarter, is something that we just don't have visibility to. But the needle is moving in the right direction.
Operator: Our next question is Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wondering, in bilevels, whether you can talk to some of the initiatives you're doing to perhaps broaden the channel and the class of patients that use those products.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, absolutely. And we are very focused on our VPAP ST-A, our VPAP COPD and across our pipeline in the COPD space. So that's the first market that we have huge opportunities for our bilevels. The VPAP COPD product was just launched in the end of Q4. So it's initial part of its S-curve. It involves some interaction through the pathway, with the sleep lab, where we have excellent channel access and channel control. And we have our VPAP Tx titration devices available in sleep labs across the country, and so we're really excited about the opportunities in COPD. Secondly, in the bilevel side, long-term, there's a huge opportunity in heart failure. And as you saw, we talked about our European growth being very strong during the quarter. That is helped by the fact that we are running SERVE-HF in France, Germany, the Nordics, as well as the U.K., as well as sites outside Europe. But we're seeing a halo effect from that trial, in the cardiorespiratory space. So, the order set CS product, which is an adaptive servo-ventilation product, an extension of those bilevels, saw some incredible growth. Not just during Q1, but over the last number of quarters. That is a long S-curve, and as we get to the end of results from SERVE-HF, which is mid-2015, there could be an inflection point in really accelerating those cardiorespiratory sales. So I'd summarize, Ian, by saying we've got great initial movement on our S9 bilevels, but there's a heck of a lot of runway ahead for us, particularly in the cardiorespiratory space.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: For my second question, can we -- just changing topics to DMEs. Just wondering, if you look at your U.S. business and breaking the DMEs into some of the large nationals, and then obviously you've got the regionals and then some of the smaller single-person operator. If you look at, say, your business last year and then projecting your business -- maybe not this year, but maybe another year out -- to what extent do you see the percentage of your business changing across those sort of various classes of DMEs, is it going to be material or is it going to be relatively gradual?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. We have good relationships with all those segments of customers from large nationals to regionals, to mom and pops. As to the exact change of it over time, I'm going to hand it to Jim Hollingshead for some thoughts there. Jim?
James Hollingshead: Thanks, Mick. The consolidation has been a gradual tectonic move in the channel over the last several years. And I think it will continue at that. Logically, you might expect a little bit of acceleration to consolidation because of CB2, but right now, we're not seeing a massive step change on that basis. And bear in mind, too, that DME is such a local business, that in many cases the local setup shall still be done by DMEs who are now subcontracting, right? So I continue to see it as a more gradual movement.
Michael J. Farrell: Partnerships like our partnership with Brightree really help the regionals. We've got EDI partnerships which really helped the nationals. We've got PCP awareness which helps the mom and pops, the regionals and the nationals. So we're willing to partner across the segments and across the categories of customers and products, and we see it as a pretty solid and steady move going forward, would be my summary there.
Operator: Our next question is Dan Hurren with UBS.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: We've noticed, when we're talking to the market, that there's a range of deals out there -- as we'd expect for sort of discounts of volumes and those sorts of things -- just wondering how they impact the P&L over time, and the other discounts. Upfront or is there a count-back? Does a customer have to do a certain volume before they get the rebate? So will that hit the P&L later on? Just wondering how that flows through over time.
Michael J. Farrell: Brett, you want to talk about how we count for our deals?
Brett A. Sandercock: I mean, they'll be a combination of all those, Dan, really. And on things like volume rebate and so on, what you do there is you have to be -- it's pretty dynamic in terms of estimating where you think volume is going to be. And then if we think they're going to hit those, then we certainly accrue as we go. So it's not like you're just going to get lumped with them all of a sudden. That will be spread out through the course of the year or whenever the volume contract is over. And then, of course, you have to make a call on what you think's really sticking and what you think that particular customer will achieve in terms of volumes.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is that are we seeing sales today that will actually result in lower sales when the rebates gets headed back in future periods.
Brett A. Sandercock: No. No, because we'd be accruing or offsetting an accrual for that rebate as we go.
Operator: Our next question is Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.
Jeffrey Chu: This is Jeff filling in for Jason. Wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about the termination of the distribution agreement with CareFusion, which I think you announced about this time 1 year ago. First off, is this timing correct? And secondly, I was hoping you'd quantify the U.S. Flow Generator business during the quarter that were from products that were part of this distribution agreement. I'm just trying to understand the impact over the next several quarters, as you anniversary this termination of this agreement.
Michael J. Farrell: Jeff, the distribution agreement with CareFusion was immaterial 1 year ago, and it remain immaterial now. How we're distributing the Stellar range of products which were involved in that agreement is that we have our own respiratory account managers across the U.S. market, which is where that bill is focused. And our respiratory account managers and our respiratory clinical specialists, who are part of our core sales force, have picked up this product. And we did better in our first quarter with our team selling our product than another team trying to sell our product over 1 whole year. So we're seeing some good momentum with Stellar, which has done incredibly well in France and Germany, where it was primarily designed for. But some really good upside opportunities that have come to us in the U.S. But, particularly, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, Stellar is a great product in the Americas geography, for Brazil, where we see the need for home care ventilation. And in some of those emerging markets, our products that are in the value space in respiratory care, have a great opportunity in that geography. So, in the Americas, I'd say one of the best geographic opportunities is right there in Brazil. But here in the U.S., we've taken over that distribution and we've started to move pretty well in it. And there's more, as I said in my opening remarks, in this market, through the end of fiscal '14, we're going to see some very interesting platform launches in the respiratory care space.
Operator: Our next question is Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: One on mix and one on the overall U.S. market. On mix, I know you don't tend to give mix on Flow Generators, but certainly, APAP over CPAP has been a driver. It seems that, that was a driver in gross margin in this quarter as well. So I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on the runway there is still left in that mix shift as we move more towards APAP over CPAP.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, so we won't break it out, Anthony. But what I'll say is that, with 35% of the diagnoses in the U.S. market being home sleep testing, pretty much every prescription that comes from a home sleep test requires some type of APAP device. And so there's a sort of good relationship between us. It's not necessarily one for one, because physicians get to see products like the S9 order set and get to love it and want to use it for many of their patients and prescribe it for [indiscernible] from the lab as well as from HST. But if you're looking for an indicator, that may be one that can help you in your calculations for working the downstream split between APAP and CPAP. But one thing remains, is that there is a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP. Why? Well, of course there's the HST trend in the U.S. market. But if you look at other markets around the world, APAP, and particularly the S9 order set, has gained share because it's better for patients. It adjusts during the night, it adjusts night to night and it is very good long-term care. And so we're seeing good outcomes from that. There's people focused more on the outcomes and the value of therapy. We're seeing products like the S9 order set get more and more attention.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then just on the U.S. market, just going back to reimbursement trends overall. I know in the past you've touched on private reimbursement relative to CMS. Is there an update as to where they stand relative to CMS at this point? And perhaps, again, as you look forward, is there any indication of direction or where private pays may be going?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, sure, Anthony. Well, as I said earlier in the Q&A here, CMS announced CB2 in February, it went into effect in July and we saw some effect in Q1. But private payers, during the last 90 days, did what they've done over the last 9 years, which is the steady reductions over time, by geography, by state. There's been business as usual as we look across the private payer space within the U.S. market.
Operator: We are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over Mick Farrell for his closing remark.
Michael J. Farrell: Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for coming and listening in on this call. I'd like to say thanks to our investors, to the analysts and our many customers who listen to this conference call. Importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the 4,000-strong global ResMed team, from Asia-Pac, Europe and the Americas, for your hard work, dedication and continued excellence. Together, we are improving, literally, millions -- multiple millions of lives in respiratory medicine, 1 breath at a time. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the Q1 2014 ResMed Inc. earnings conference call. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. There are also other members of the management team present here today that will be available to answer your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Connie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q4, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail. So first, the financial summary. We finished with solid financial performance. This is the 74th consecutive quarter in which we have grown the top line since our IPO in 1995. We're pretty proud of that achievement, but we have huge opportunities in front of us. We believe we are in mile 1 of a marathon with plenty of energy, innovation and a solid strategy for the 25-plus miles to go. Global revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 grew 11% year-on-year to $415 million, also up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Americas revenue grew 11% to $230 million. Europe, Asia and rest of the world combined headline revenue increased 12% for the quarter. And that is 11% on a constant-currency basis. For fiscal year 2013, and for the first time in ResMed's history, we reached $1.5 billion in annual global revenue. We're pretty proud of this milestone. ResMed's world-leading product quality, exceptional service and our innovative data solutions all continue to drive growth and these types of results. Net income for the quarter increased 18% to $91 million on a non-GAAP basis, while EPS increased 17% to $0.62 for the quarter. That's also on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP numbers exclude the impact of the previously announced onetime Sydney University charge. Brett will walk you through all the details on GAAP and non-GAAP financials shortly. Earnings per share was a record $0.63, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles. This bottom line result demonstrates excellent global operating performance from the global team of 4,000 ResMedians. Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by strong sales of our leading S9 order set device, our VPAP range of bilevel devices and our latest ventilation flow generator, the Stellar. We continue to expand market share in the APAP and the bilevel categories as well. Our Respiratory Care products are receiving broad acceptance, especially in the treatment of COPD, the #3 killer in the Western world, and a disease that can be significantly helped with our noninvasive ventilation solutions. In the Americas region, flow generator sales were strong this quarter. The S9 order set and the VPAP Adapt device, which treats patients with central sleep apnea and periodic breathing, both performed particularly well. We attribute a lot of these share gains and positive mix shift to EasyCare Online and growth of home sleep testing, respectively. Additionally, we are seeing a trend that new patient growth is improving in the U.S. Turning to Europe. France performed well in the quarter and both our German dealer business, as well as our German homecare business had strong growth, as did the U.K. and the Nordics region. European results were driven by strength in both Flow Generators and in Masks. The order set CS, which is now on our S9 platform, and the Stellar, both did particularly well. Mask growth was also solid across the region. So despite fiscal constraints and the changing macroeconomic environment in Europe, the ResMed value proposition of treating patients at home, saving healthcare costs while improving quality of life is proving itself to be in demand. In the Asia-Pacific region, we had an excellent quarter, growing at solid double-digit rates. We had strong sales in mature markets like Japan, as well as in key emerging markets, including India and China. Rob, our COO, and I spent a number of weeks visiting doctors, distributors, patients and government groups throughout Asia this quarter. We believe this growth opportunity is just beginning. And as our Executive Chairman would say, we are just lacing our shoes for the Asian growth marathon. We have an excited, focused and dedicated team in that region. And that will help us drive towards this potential. On healthcare informatics, EasyCare Online, which is our cloud-based clinical management system, continues to lead and to grow. Additionally, our U-Sleep patient engagement solution is gaining traction. We're seeing solid uptake from both existing and new customers. In this challenging environment with government reimbursement changes coupled with mandates to address growing healthcare costs, we believe ResMed's core value proposition of reducing healthcare costs by taking care of respiratory diseases at home is being well received by patients, physicians, providers and by payers. It's all about driving outcomes and having the data to prove it. ResMed is demonstrating that we deliver these results for our customers. Regarding our patient interface business, growth was driven primarily by sales in the full face Mask category, particularly in Europe. We also saw solid growth in Mask components and accessories across the globe. We plan to stay ahead of the game in our Mask business, where we are the #1 brand preferred by patients. We're constantly innovating and our solutions will continue to be smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better than ever. Our product pipeline in patient innovations remains strong. We released 2 exciting new masks this quarter. First, the Quattro Air launch. It is the smallest, lightest and least obtrusive full face mask on the planet. We're very excited about its prospects for patients. And its initial reception was very positive. Second, we released the Swift FX Nano, our latest nasal mask. This launched in Europe and in Canada, and is progressing very well. We have plans to release more patient in face products during fiscal 2014. And we are very excited about our innovation in this space. Moving on to our Respiratory Care business. We had our best quarter ever in this space with record global sales. This growth is primarily due to sales of the Stellar device range in Europe, especially in Germany and in France. Japan also had a very strong quarter in Respiratory Care. In the U.S., Respiratory Care market sales of the VPAP COPD, specifically targeted for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is exceeding our expectations. And the ClimateLine Oxy, a heating breathing circuit that allows oxygen connectivity to the humidified circuit, is also doing well. For our VPAP STA product, which advanced 2 generations from our S9 to our -- from our S7 to our latest S9 platform, we're seeing incredibly strong growth. In the humidification category, our HumiCare D900 product is doing very well in Germany and the Nordics. We also received FDA clearance for this product during the quarter. Stay tuned for additional growth and product pipeline expansion in our Respiratory Care business. On the home sleep testing front, now over 50% of commercially covered U.S. adult lives require PSG pre-authorization. This is steering providers and patients towards home sleep testing. To that point, we estimate that at the end of fiscal '13, approximately 30% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests were through home sleep testing. We anticipate and model that to grow to 40%-plus over the coming 12 months. And we think it will end up beyond that in the years ahead. Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. Around 60% of sleep labs in the U.S. are now offering home sleep testing based on our latest sleep lab survey data. Primary care physicians continue to become more involved in the diagnosis and management of sleep apnea, and are partnering with their pulmonary colleagues. That involvement is starting to gain momentum. Finally, an overview of our global clinical trials. Enrollment in our heart failure trial, SERVE-HF, as in a tennis "serve" dash "HF," for heart failure is now complete with over 1,325 patients recruited. This milestone makes SERVE-HF the biggest and most important heart failure trial in the history of our industry. We should have final data late in calendar year 2015 through early calendar 2016. Our goal is to present at major cardiovascular conferences, and to publish final results in a premier medical journal. In addition, we've completed the protocol, as shown in our press release, for a new U.S.-based heart failure study, which we are calling CAT-HF, as in "cat" dash "HF." This trial will be run by professional Chris O'Connor, who is a global leader in heart failure and cardiovascular medicine from Duke University on the East Coast of the United States. Professor O'Connor is an accomplished clinical investigator, who has been an author on more than 400 peer-review publications in the field. We expect enrollment in CAT-HF to commence in the latter part of this calendar year. So let me wrap up with this. Our core sleep apnea business is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers and payers to manage outcomes for this costly chronic disease. This solutions approach also applies to our growing Respiratory Care business and our fast-growing Cardiorespiratory business. The combination of our range of world-leading quality Flow Generators, the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems, as well as easy to assess robust actionable software solutions makes ResMed's offering the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new masks and new technology, as well as business process innovation for the plan across our 3 horizons of growth: sleep, respiratory care and cardiology. We are improving patient's quality of life and preventing disease progression, as well as reducing the burden of healthcare costs for chronic diseases. We think of this as the Holy Grail of healthcare. We changed more than 7 million lives during these last 12 months. And we plan to drive that to 10 million lives and well beyond in the coming years. So now I'll turn the call over from here in San Diego to our CFO in Sydney. Brett, over to you.
Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the June quarter was $414.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 11%. Excluding the impact of the onetime Sydney University charge, income from operations for the quarter was $110.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $90.7 million, an increase of 18% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the Sydney University charge, was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 17% over the prior-year quarter. GAAP net income for the quarter was $73 million. And GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.7%, up sequentially from Q3 FY '13. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Indeed, we estimate the weaker Australian dollar will contribute approximately 70 basis points to our gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 27.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.5%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 28% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.4 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 14%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.5%. Looking forward, we expect our R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research in development is undertaken in Australia. During the quarter, we reached an agreement with the University of Sydney to pay $24.8 million for the establishment of 2 perpetual academic chairs, the funding of future research in the fields of sleep medicine and biomedical engineering, and the settlement of a legal proceedings between the parties. This is a nonrecurring charge and we have expensed the full amount of $24.8 million in our fourth quarter results. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9% compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 22%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a tax benefit from the Sydney University charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operation. Excluding the impact of the Sydney University charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.7%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $230.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $184.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 11% over the prior-year quarter. Breaking up revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generators sales were $104.7 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $125.6 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generators sales were $124.8 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $59.5 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms also an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, Flow Generators sales increased by 13%, while Masks and other increased by 8%. Cash flow from operations was a record $123.9 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings in working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $16 million. And depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.7 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $72.7 million. For fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for consideration of $188 million. At the end of June, we had approximately 4.5 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. This represents an increase of 47% over our previously declared dividend, and demonstrates our commitment to delivering shareholder returns through our capital management program. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $575 million. And at June 30, total assets stood at $2.2 billion. And net equity was $1.6 billion. I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Dan Hurren with UBS.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Look, I know you haven't spoken about it, and you probably don't want to talk about it, but just issue a price. It's been such a big topic of discussion in the industry both in the investor [ph]industry and in the sleep apnea industry. And you can't spend more than 5 minutes in the industry without people giving you sort of 20 examples of big profit lock. Can you just talk about what you're seeing, and why you think the market is getting it so wrong in the message that they're getting from your customers?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Dan. That question allows us to talk about our long-term cost control and investment strategies looking forward. But, yes, certainly, price is a question. I mean, it's the discussion that comes up with our customers because it's Monday morning. And the sun is out. And it comes into the question when is the end of the quarter, and when is the start of the quarter. So price is always the discussion for us with our customers. We tend to focus on looking for the long term. We invest in driving growth through volume gain, and can use price as a tool as part of that. And when we work with customers, and they are seeking price discounts, we look for volume gains to get there. We also, when the topic of price comes up, and we're discussing price, we look at the long-term value that we provide the customer, which we are very good at modeling at and getting better at as we look at the economics of our HME customers in the U.S. and our HCP, home care provider customers in Europe, and the many other business models we have in the 100 countries we do business in. And as we analyze that, we're able to come up with effective ways to take costs out of the supply chain, to take costs out of the system through electronic data in change or whether it's healthcare informatics data or supply data and beyond. So in short, we've talked about traditionally a sort of 3% to 5% price reduction that we've seen in the market. It's probably more in the 4% to 6% range now. And you can model that sort of range going forward. But it's certainly something that when we look at our cost structure and we look at our investments for the future, we're looking at taking more than that 4% to 6% out so that we can maintain our margins. And as you saw in these quarter's results, we had a very solid 62%-plus number. And we're pretty proud of that.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just one other one. Just in regards to the ventilation business. I know you don't break that out, but can you give us an indication of just how material that is becoming? And I mean, we're just trying to understand what level of this pretty extraordinary U.S. flow gen [ph] growth -- or sorry, global flow gen [ph] growth is being driven by the respiratory part of the business?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Dan. We're not going to break out our Respiratory Care or ventilation business. We already, as the only global pure play and respiratory medicine company who's public, expose every 90 days a far greater deal of granularities than any of the other players out there. We have to do research to understand how the other 2 large-ish players are doing. But I can talk to it directionally. And certainly, the growth in Respiratory Care is very strong. We're #1 or #2 in every Respiratory Care home-care market throughout Western Europe. But we are not that in the Americas and many parts of Asia-Pacific. So there's a huge opportunity in front of us to grow our U.S. Respiratory Care business, to grow our Latin American Respiratory Care business, to grow our Respiratory Care business in many countries in Asia-Pacific where often our products can move from the hospital to the home. And that hospital-to-home approach is something that we've had excelled at in Europe, and can bring to the other markets around the world. So I think although the core growth in the global Respiratory Care space is probably in the mid-single digits, we can beat that by going after new geographic expansion, and also creating and leveraging new categories that our technologies as a leader in the sleep disorder breathing space with a cost structure and scale that brings can allow us to penetrate and expand, take share, but also grow reach in the global Respiratory Care business.
Operator: The next question comes Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So following on the prior question, maybe talk a little bit about something that's been rather topical. Did the checks that people are getting where DMEs are claiming 20% price cuts and concessions from you guys and from other players, how do you characterize that? Where is that coming from? Is that things you're walking away from or in some cases, you're taking in exchange for volumes? Or these comments have been quite broad spread, and I'm just trying to get some context on where people are wrong if they're taking those data points.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Ben, I'm going to hand this question over to Jim Hollingshed, who's our President for the Americas. But just on the global scope of things, we're in 100 countries. These data point that I believe were published by someone doing research was in one of those countries -- the U.S., which happens to be around 50% of our revenues. But it's one data point out of thousands of customers. So with that caveat, I'll hand over to Jim to provide some color to your question.
James Hollingshead: Thanks, Mick. Hi Ben. So guys obviously, what's going on in the Americas market is the implementation of competitive bidding. And that implementation literally just went live. And so when the run-up to that the price points that came out of competitive bidding are painful for our customers. And we talked about that last quarter. And I think that's the first point I would make because we understand its painful for our customers and we're working through that with them. In terms of -- we're not going to talk about any specific deals or any specific customers. I would say that our practice in pricing remains the way it has been, which is we use pricing strategically. And so when we do deals with customers, we're typically doing them either because we're gaining volume or we're gaining share. We're doing something that makes economic sense for us and for our customers. The price trend in the market, we've been saying for a long time that in the category, has consistently had ASP declines in the 3% to 5% range on an annualized basis. And as Mick just said, that's probably moved now to maybe a 4% to 6% annualized range. I would say in the quarter in the run-up to the implementation of competitive bidding, we have seen some increase in short-term price pressure. But we dealt with that strategically. And we're working with our customers to help them address their business needs. And price is only one way that we work with our customers, all right? So we do other things with our customers. We're -- on a product basis, clearly, we provide products that create more value for them to drive more compliance to more effective products. And we're increasingly introducing solutions that help them run their business more efficiently as well, things like ECO and the U-Sleep platform. So price is an issue. CB2 is an issue in the marketplace. But it's, I think -- bluntly, I think it's been overblown and the way people are looking at the market broadly, it's painful for our customers. And we're working that through with them.
Michael J. Farrell: And I know -- I'd add on to that. Thanks, Jim. Great performance with your comments, and I'd add on to that. But this is not Coke versus Pepsi in a limited soft drink market growing 0% to 3%. This is about a market where we're less than 10%, 15% penetrated even in the U.S., which is our most penetrated market of all our geography. So it's about the 85% in front of us and in finding the right investments to make, to grow those markets. But I underline Jim's comments.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And, Jim, just following on with that, I know the run-up has maybe been a little bit more intense. Why wouldn't they intensify further? Is there something about that run-up that then sets price for the coming period? Or are we going to continue to have this intensification when we talk next quarter and the December quarter?
James Hollingshead: Well, Ben, I think that's a really good question. And we don't have a crystal ball and so it's hard for us to predict exactly what's going to happen. But in the run-up period, what's going on, of course, is that people who've won and accepted contracts, and I'll make a side point there, which is not everybody accepted the contracts, right, because there are a number of players out there that have decided that they can make more money in commercial pay. But those who have won and accepted contracts are building business models of there after the quarter and getting ready to implement against what will probably be higher volume for them. And they need to understand how they're going to run their businesses so they're negotiating for price in front of that, right? So it's hard to know exactly what will happen, say, over the next quarter or next 2 quarters as that continues to play itself out. And we're going to continue to work strategically with all the leverage we win for our customers' businesses. But I think that if you just look at what they're getting ready for as Medicare throws the switch on the pricing, our anticipation is that most of the pressure is probably Q4 and maybe into Q1 a little bit.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then the private payers are they following on? Or is this sort of a delayed response on their side? And that's it.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Look, I'll answer that, Jim, if that's okay with you. The Medicare CMS competitive bidding process has been in place for 4, 5-plus years. All these changes have been signaled with 12, 24 even 36 months notice for the customers. So our company's pretty sophisticated, we've been able to model out their economics pretty intense around 1, around 2 and beyond. So there's nothing new that's going to happen from today, from yesterday. And frankly, since the numbers came out earlier this calendar year, there's been no changes to those core economics. But historically, CMS has been priced significantly above all the private payers, which is kind of unique in med tech. Usually, it's the other way around. And as CMS has seen that 4 years ago, like an efficient government process, they took 4 years to get there, but have eventually, 4 years later, got in line with the private payers. We don't think this triggers a response from your private payers and we haven't seen that. The private payers have been looking at this quarterly over those 4 years and we'll continue to look at it on an ongoing basis as well. Thanks for the questions, Ben.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question calls -- comes from Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Some of the other things I've seen speaking to your customers is that they are looking for perhaps a broader entry level device -- a fixed pressure device that captures all the compliance requirements. I think we're seeing one of your competitors come out with such a product. Are you guys considering moving back into that fixed pressure segment of the market? Or is your focus still the high-end APAP segment?
Michael J. Farrell: So we've been playing in the fixed CPAP market since 1989. And we've been playing in the APAP category with our AutoSet range since 1992, I think. So both of these 2 decades’ worth of experience playing in both in fixed pressure and auto-setting pressure categories. The reason we believe -- in fact, we're incredibly confident that APAP as a category will continue to grow, is that APAP is a requirement for the cost savings achieved through home sleep testing. To make home sleep testing effective, you have to be able to allow the patient to have their pressure set in the home. And the only way to do that cost effectively is with an APAP category device. Our S9 AutoSet happens to have that 20 years of legacy in its algorithm and advances, and we believe is the leading algorithm in that space. So we believe the category of APAP will continue to grow share. And we believe that the S9 AutoSet will continue to grow share within that growing category. And so therefore, we are already in the fixed pressure device category. And we will remain there. There are some markets and some geographies and some patient groups for which CPAP pressure is the best approach. But there are many, and it's growing, of the greater value of our products like the S9 AutoSets are incredibly important. So we're already there, and we'll continue to play in CPAP. But driving the high-value APAP category is just part of an industry trend and we are absolutely on top of that, and a big part of it. While thinking about flow generators and the types of margins, the real highest end of this range is our Respiratory Care business. And that's an area where we are playing with customers with much higher cost basis and bringing in devices from the sleep space. So we think that opportunity to have margins at solid levels into the future is driven by not only the CPAP and APAP categories, but also by the VPAP category, which is the bilevel devices, and really importantly the noninvasive ventilation devices like our Stellar product.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And maybe just a separate follow-up question. But you mentioned the small increase in ASP declines to be the same. Can you talk to what impact do you think competitive bidding this year will have on volume growth to the industry? And whether you realistically think you will see DMEs closing down patients having to migrate across to other stores. How impactful do you think this whole process will be on the DME base?
Michael J. Farrell: So we have the real-time experiment with round 1 where we believe that as some of the smaller mom-and-pop type HMEs went out of business in some cases. Larger regionals and some large national players took the share of patients. And we were worried about some orphan patients in their process, patients that had a device and didn't have anyone following up with the Mask side. What we found was that the large regionals and the large nationals, with their very efficient systems for contacting patients, and checking appropriately if they need new masks and accessories, as they picked up those patients, we saw some increase in volume on the trailing revenue side, the opportunity for Masks & Accessories. So I would say it's probably mutual on the Device side. But there may be some volume upside on the Masks & Accessories side. But that's how we'd look at round 1 and round 2. We're in day 31. So we'll be watching that on an ongoing basis. But we would expect the same model to play out as the same types of people have become the winners in round 2, as we're winners during round 1. I don't know if, Jim, you'd like to add any more detail?
James Hollingshead: Yes. I completely agree with what you said. And I would just add a couple of things. I think it's computing for the patients, but it's not computing for the DMEs at some level, right? So the next point, any DMEs that they're buying up a patient list from a smaller DME is doing that because they know they're going to go find that patient and work with them, right? So I think the way Medicare has communicated to patients has created some confusion for patients. And so there's -- that's got to be worked through. But I think the people buying list will figure that out from the DME side. I don't think CB2 has a material impact on volume and market overall, except they might have upside, as Mick has described. I think U.S. market, and therefore America's volume, is likely to be more impacted by the shift to home sleep testing, which is we think is bringing in more new patient volume right now. And the reason for that is commercial pairs are shifting the market to home sleep testing. And home sleep testing is more acceptable to the patient. So it's a long time been a barrier for patient to get tested for OSA because they don't want to go spend the night in a lab. And as payers move to HST, more patients on the market are going to agree to get tested. And we think that's already creating a little bit of a lift in total new patient volume to the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Prior with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a follow-up question, I guess, from solds in terms of volume instruction, and Mick or Jim, if you want to take this. I guess one of the other things in regards to the volume discount deals that's being done. Given with round 1, on the wash-up from round 1, we saw from CMS reports that utilization of volumes has slowed down. Do the volume discount deals being done around this period of CB2 help mitigate that volume slow down risk going into, obviously, the September quarter?
Michael J. Farrell: Jim?
James Hollingshead: I don't -- I think there's conflicting data on utilization and growth in the market. I don't see a big risk to a drop in utilization to Medicare. And I think that the incidents and problems of disease keeps going up. The latest data that I've seen from Medicare shows that the max of all increase in claims over the last couple of quarters. And as I say, I think the overall market is growing. So again, I don't -- that's not how I would think about the model of the volume of the market.
Michael J. Farrell: And, Matthew, you -- if adjusting on competitive bidding, you're thinking about the 25% of the market that is CMS. The 75% of the market, that is private payers, looking at this differently. And many of them has had for many years disease management programs. Many of them are now starting to look at care management programs. As we have conversations with payers, we are driving conversations along with our HME partners that drive towards the opportunity for our therapies to take patients out of the hospital and to save money, and to improve the quality of life for the patients. This matters especially to the employers who are the payers customers, who are self-insured. It matters incredibly importantly to the new accountable care organizations or ACOs that are forming as part of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. And we're going to see more and more systems of payer provider combination, such as you have at the VA, at Kaiser, at Intermountain Health, at Geisinger. Those types of models are going to expand. And we think the long-term return on investment -- in fact, we know the long-term return on investment of taking a patient with sleep-disorder breathing and getting them on treatment saves money for the healthcare system. So we think that 75% of the market is more apt on the private side for those conversations and fresh for it. We think the government will probably follow. But that will be our take on the long-term view and plans for care management.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. And just my second question in terms of, I guess, again, focusing on the volume-type deals that are done to offset the pricing impact, when you think of the big 3 manufacturers, you represent such a large portion of the whole industry. With the small guys now, you're relatively small in market share terms. If all the big 3 are doing volume discount-type deals, and that's why each of the 3 have tried to offset the price impact of competitive bidding. Obviously, they're getting market share winners or losers out of that? And if you're a DME that's been offered a similar deal from all 3 brands, who do you obviously favor then in terms of giving that volume to then, obviously, get that discount from that manufacturer? Can you talk about like the CMS order effect on this? And whether compliance provider payout point of view of private or government is having influence? So do you think you will win out on that market share front because of compliance bartering the [indiscernible]? And as the market shifts in that direction, is that a fair statement or -- because obviously there's going to have to be winners and losers are out of this in terms of market share in order to kind of stay neutral on the pricing effect?
Michael J. Farrell: Well, thanks, Matthew. That was a very complex question with a multi-varied areas that actually we could take the whole -- rest of the Q&A session to go through each of them. I'll choose to focus, which are great questions in some ways. I'll focus on your question about the big 3 and what -- really the big 2, what will happen with the market going forward. I think as we partner with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our homecare providers in Europe and the different models we have in different geographies, our strong partnerships in Japan, we're getting a much greater understanding of the value of our products, the value of our health informatics products to provide data to a payer or data to a provider or data to a physician. And now, with SleepSeeker and U-Sleep data to a patient. And the value associated with all of that. So the discussion of will our market share grow or decline is less to do with the latest changes in U.S. Medicare reimbursement. It's more to do with the long-term value proposition of what we bring to the market, an understanding of that. You saw the data that we showed that our brand value from patients is very high in the Mask area. We've known that for many years. But what we're getting to understand more is our brand value with our partners, the providers, the physicians and the customers, and how we can save them money and save them time. So we think rational economic decisions will be made along the value chain. And we think ResMed is well-positioned to grow its market share based upon those rational economic decisions, based on real value that we bring to our customers. And a lot of that is tied to the ResMed brand. The underlying foundation for that is the core economic and strategic growth value we bring to the market. The SERVE-HF study is just an example of how we're driving long-term growth. But there are multi-varied detailed areas that we provide value that we don't have time to cover in this call, but we can in upcoming calls.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, will make this as just a confirmation that to offset competitive bidding with the revenue line, you really have to take market share step by step?
Michael J. Farrell: So, yes. Look, as price goes down, the volume goes up. Cost structures go down. Cost was taken out of the system to keep gross margin where it's at. We have to -- if this 4% to 6% price declines on an annualized basis, we have to take 4% to 6% out of the total cost structure. But there are probably many different ways to drive long-term economic value apart from just looking at the GM line. I don't know if others want to have a comment?
James Hollingshead: I will just add, I do think the question's a bit complicated. And I now understand what you're trying to get, Matthew. So excuse me for being a little slow on the uptake. But it depends on how fast the market's growing, right? And globally, the market continues to have healthy growth. In the Americas, the market continues to have healthy growth. And so we can gain or lose market share and still have a healthy business depending on our underlying market growth. As it happens, the market is growing, and we're taking share. And we're taking share because our products are better. And our products aren't just better on some abstract feature and functionality sense, they're better because they're more comfortable, which means that patients are more compliant and in the U.S. reimbursement scheme, that means our DMEs get paid on a higher percentage of patients to get set up on our devices. And they get more replenishment revenue out of us -- they're better from a revenue point of view. And we're also taking share because our solutions take costs out and help our customers drive more efficiency. And that's how our system works. We invest in innovation to make it better for our patients and for our customers. So market's growing and we're taking share.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Smith with Citigroup.
Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You mentioned your patient growth is improving. Does that mean market growth rates will then move beyond the 6% to 8%? And can you make some comments around market growth?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Alex. Our market growth outlook is still in the 6% to 8% range on a revenue basis globally. And I would say in the Americas market, it's around 6% to 8% as well. In Europe, we're probably looking at the low end of that -- 6% or slightly lower. In Asia-Pacific, we're looking at north of the 8% into the double digits. So those market's growth numbers as best we can tell are there. We're starting to see some volume uptick in the U.S., as we mentioned in our remarks earlier, offset somewhat by some of the price declines that we are seeing in that geography. But over the globe, we're looking at a solid 6% to 8% market growth industry. As I go to JPMorgan and go to all these med tech conferences, is a pretty darn good growth rate for a med tech space. And to be positioned at #1 or #2 in that space in all of the 100 countries we're in we think is a very solid position to be in. But it's not material enough for any of those individual country changes yet to change that sort of 6% to 8% global growth number. But it's a complex calculation, Alex. It's not simple. We know in detail 40-something percent of it because it's our revenues. We don't know the other 50% as well and have to garner that the way you do. But our estimate is solid in that 6% to 8% range globally.
Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And Brett, can you -- what sort of currency assumptions are you seeing, and particularly for U.S. dollar in saying that it will add 70 basis points to gross margin?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes.
Michael J. Farrell: Were you wondering who are addressing?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. No, I'll take that, Alex. Yes, so looking at that as you know, with the infield washing through, you've always got about a one-quarter lag on currency. So if that's -- that's sort of in play now. That's already happening in terms of that improvement there. Going forward, as it washes through, if you're looking to quarter 2 and 3 with current exchange rates and you'll certainly get incremental benefit north of that as we work into Q2. But essentially, Q1 gets locked in and then we should get some more benefit coming through in Q2 as inventory washes through this system. So if -- and currency is a really volatile environment, so you never know for sure. But at current rates, you would expect that we'll get 70 basis points in Q1, and then we should get a bit better in Q2.
Operator: The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I want to switch gears a little bit here and get back to your clinical trials. What is the timing of when we will see the SERVE-HF data?
Michael J. Farrell: So, Joanne, the SERVE-HF trial has just completed enrollment this last quarter. So 1,325 patients enrolled, but it's a 2-year follow-up study. So each patient, including the last ones that were enrolled, have to remain on the therapy for 2 years. Just as a reminder for everybody, the 2 outcomes from that trial, that the trial is powered for, is mortality and morbidity. So saving lives and saving money through hospitalization reduction. So we need to keep those patients on for 2 years. So that pushes us to about this time, 2015, when the final patient has reached that 2-year mark. Then we have to assess the data. Of course, this is a completely blinded trial to ResMed and to the investigators. So it's a CIC that has to be unblinded, and then analyzed and go through all the bio analytics and so on. And then it has to go seek publication in a large cardiovascular journal and get put on the conferences. So in short, we're looking late calendar '15, early calendar '16 for those data to be released to the public and then we'll be discussing on those types of conference calls. So it's a real long-term investment for the industry. And we're really proud that it's the largest study to ever complete enrollment and when it finishes, we think it will be the largest and most important in pivotal study in heart failure treatment with adaptive servo-ventilation. And we are very excited about its prospects.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. My second question has to do with the U.S. Mask market. It was a little bit weak in the third fiscal quarter and a little bit weaker in the fourth fiscal quarter, and I was just curious, do you have any color on what may be going on there?
Michael J. Farrell: Thanks, Joanne. Yes, clearly, we have seen some pressure, competitive pressure on the patient interface front. We love a health industry. We love various industry players coming to compete in the different categories. The Mirage FX had, had many, many, quarters of incredible success through this launch a couple of years ago in the nasal category space. Recently, Philips Respironics introduced their Wisp mask into that category. And F&P introduced their Eson mask into that category. So we have seen some pressure in the nasal mask category. Mirage FX remains the best, we believe. But the others have some value propositions that are being trialed and selected by some customers. As we said in the pre-remarks, we have a very solid pipeline in patient interfaces. And over the coming fiscal year '14, you will see us release products not only into that nasal category, but beyond that without going into any further granularity as to those releases. And we will not say by quarter, by category because we're the only public player in this space. We're very excited about the patient interface pipeline and as it comes to market, we think our customers will, as they have historically, see its value.
Operator: The next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I have another mask question as well. So we saw a pretty nice reacceleration, all U.S. I was hoping you could maybe tell us what you think is driving the rebound there?
Michael J. Farrell: Rob, do you want to address that perhaps...
Robert Douglas: Yes. And look, I think it's just cost supported markets where teams have been performing well and executing well, getting the deals, servicing the customers. We think the competitive products have been there for a while and they have had some impact, but it's not permanent impact. So some response from that. Overall, just good performance all around really. We're having a good quarter in many, many countries around the world.
Michael J. Farrell: Regarding some pretty strong relationships, David, with our European customers and the value that we bring on the masks are very different. They don't get paid on a per unit basis as reimbursement is in the U.S. So the value is more long term. So some of those assessments are more long term. But we've been able to provide that data to them and we think that communication and that partnership with our major customers in Europe and throughout Asia-Pac has allowed us to drive that Europe and Asia-Pacific mask growth. And we think it's reasonably sustainable into the future because the value you get is over a long period of time and it can be sustainable.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And a quick one for Brett. You alluded to pricing impact in gross margin in the quarter? Can you quantify how much of an offset that was to gross margin?
Brett A. Sandercock: Well, I mean it's working through on the really around that 4% to 6% range on ASPs and sort of working through that impact, David. So if you look at the kind of the drivers on the gross margin was, obviously, we're still getting favorable product mix coming through. And we're also working pretty hard on the cost basis, Mick mentioned around manufacturing around our supply chain and procurement and so on. So those have been the drivers really of the margin expansion for a while now. And traditionally, we've always had some offsets with ASP declines. It is typically 3% to 5% and around the 4% to 6%. And that's the major offset, but you can still see that we're still getting expansion in our gross margins. So those positive drivers are currently outweighing ASP declines. But it does have some negative impact.
Operator: The next question comes from Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: Yes. Could I ask a follow-up question on gross margin? Just asking if you look at the drivers, Brett, in fiscal '13 looking forward to '14, you're looking at cost out mix shift to Singapore and also the bilevels. Which of those factors do you think were strongest in '13? And which will have the same sort of character in '14?
Brett A. Sandercock: I think, I mean they're both meaningful contributors. And, no, if you look at it over the years and on the trends, pretty consistent kind of contributors for both of those. We continue to -- it depends how fast and how the mix goes through FY '14. It is notoriously difficult to predict on some of these mix changes and timing of when we get, for example, improvements coming through on manufacturing. It is driven, for example, by new product introduction and so on where we can get some, if you like, kind of step change-type improvements. And then we work on a bunch of incremental improvements along the way. So that can -- coming at various times. But I think looking forward, I still think we'll get a benefit from both of those. And we will, if the currencies sort of stay where they are, we'll get some tailwind from the currency as well, which is back -- the Aussie is back to where it was selling like 3 years ago selling against the U.S. dollar. So we've been up against headwinds on the currency for quite a few years and that looks like we may get some benefit from the currency going forward. And that's also into the gross margin mix. And so I think now you can have -- you have 3 positive factors playing out on that margin and you'll just have the negative on the ASP. But so far, we've built -- with currency, and we'll deal with other things that are thrown at us and continue to work hard on cost out initiatives.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: Great. Can I ask a last, perhaps, Mick or Jim, on the pricing? The ResMed has always been historically a premium price player. And after on a sort of like-for-like basis after budding discounts, where do you see your premiums, your 2P is currently?
Michael J. Farrell: Ian, we're not going to go into the detail of pricing information. But generically and globally, we are the premium player. The premium may be in the single digits on some flow generator lines. It might be in the double digits in terms of percentages on some of our high-differentiated items at the high end of, say, the Mask range or the Respiratory Care range where we have the value given to the customer. All those premiums on pricing are linked to the premium that the customer attributes to the value of that product. And so it's by SKU, it's by geography, it's by customer and it's by our current share with the customers and our future growth opportunities with the customers. So it's a very complex equation. But in short, we haven't changed that philosophy. We're the value player. We're the premium player. And we maintained ourselves as the value player in this Q4 and throughout fiscal year '13. And we will do that going forward in FY '14. We think the discipline of pricing to your value is incredibly important for the long-term sustainable growth of this industry. And the investments that we are making in a $20 million, $30-plus million trials in SERVE-HF to change the potential trajectory of millions of heart failure patients only comes by linking value to pricing, to long-term investments for the industry. So the short answer is we are a value player. And we will maintain ourselves as a value player going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just on -- a couple for Brett and one for Mick. The $5.8 million in other expense, was that all AUD hedge losses and heavy renewed year hedges and more favorable rates considering the currency move? And then just a follow-up for Mick.
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, Anthony. That is essentially FX hedging losses that have come through. We do mark-to-market. So basically, that brings forward any losses into that quarter. So as you think about if currencies then stay pretty much exactly the same, then you get fairly negligible FX gains and losses going forward. Of course, that'll move around. But essentially, that's what would happen. So that's basically what that was. And your other question, Anthony?
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Sure. If we elaborate a little bit, Mick, on the volume sort of range, and instead you're engaging with DME customers, can you sort of go into actually how those are structured? Are you requiring them to purchase up from volumes, excess inventories upfront? Or are those commitments over an extended period of time? And then maybe just a quick follow-up would be are there any other promotions that you will be engaging in as you move into the round 2?
Michael J. Farrell: So the short answer is, Anthony, there's nothing new in this space. The long answer is that we don't go into detailed descriptions of any of our contracts with customers in any geography. Some of them can be a month. And some of them can be 2 years. And some of them have volume commitments. Some of them have strategic market development commitments that we make to each other. The variance across our contracts with the thousands of customers we do is so broad. But there was nothing new in Q4. And we don't plan to do anything new in fiscal '14 in terms of volume and pricing arrangements. What we intend to do is invest for the long-term sustainable growth of this industry. And with 99%-plus of the opportunity left in countries like China and India, that Rob and I were at just a couple of weeks ago, with certainly 95% of the opportunity in front of us in Asia, with 90-plus percent of the opportunity in Europe and 85%-plus of the opportunity left in the Americas, we think that we truly are in mile 1 of the marathon and we're not getting tired.
Operator: We are now at the 1-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks.
Michael J. Farrell: Thank you very much. And what I'd like to say is as always, thanks to the many investors, analysts and customers, and even the competitors who listen to this conference call. But most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the nearly 4,000 employees of ResMed from Asia-Pacific, Europe and Americas for their hard work, dedication and continued excellence. Together, we are changing lives in respiratory medicine one breath at a time. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the fourth quarter 2013 ResMed Inc. Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2013 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Trish, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.
Constance C. Bienfait: Thank you, Trish, and thank you all for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, new product launches or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. [Operator Instructions] Speaking on the call today are Peter Farrell, Executive Chairman; Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell. Peter, please go ahead.
Peter C. Farrell: Okay. Thank you, Connie, and thanks to everyone for joining us. After this call, I'll turn over responsibility for the handling of future quarterly earnings calls to Mick, who the board appointed as CEO, which most of you would have come across last month. And as an aside, let me point out that we had a 2-year search, which the board conducted under the auspices of Spencer Stuart, and we examined both internal and external candidates. And the decision was made, as I said, last month. So I'll review the quarter, and then Mick, who's currently in London, will join the call and make some brief remarks before we hand over the call to Brett Sandercock to go through the numbers in more detail. So first, the financial summary. As you would have seen from the press release, we finished another solid quarter. This represents the 73rd consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line and obviously, we're extremely pleased about that. Global revenue in the third quarter grew 10%, both actual and constant currency numbers to $334 million. Revenue in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $215 million, and ROW revenue increased 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. And that also was in both actual and constant currency terms, and that was to $168 million. We believe that these results were from as a result of both superior product quality and full solution offerings. And these 2 aspects continue to drive our growth. Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $85 million while GAAP EPS increased 32% to $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.59, which showed excellent operating performance. The global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels and adaptive servo-ventilation, as well as in Respiratory Care with the Stellar. We believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, and we are also gaining share back in bilevels. In short, our respiratory products are being well-received. And there is plenty of room for us to continue to grow in all these areas. For example, in the Americas, where Flow Generator sales were particularly strong this quarter, we had the S9 AutoSet, bilevels and VPAP Adapt, which of course is our adaptive servo-ventilator in the U.S., all did particularly well. And we attribute a lot of the share gains and mix shift to both the positive responses to EasyCare Online and to increases in home sleep testing, which I will discuss in a little more detail. Turning to the rest of the world. There is still a lot of uncertainty in Europe. However, we were gratified with the results in both the U.K. and Germany. So despite the challenging economic climate throughout Europe, as well as fiscal constraints, the focus is still on treatment that keeps patients out of hospital and healthy. AutoSet CS, again our ASV offering in Europe, VPAP ST and Stellar products did well again this quarter in most parts of Europe. The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter, with strong sales in Japan and India, although as we've explained on a number of occasions, Japan sales are inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. And in this particular quarter, Japan was a little soft though, but not unexpected. Japan ended this fiscal year end, and these distractions that is Teijin, ended their fiscal year on March 31. And those distractions tend to affect their sales during this quarter. And as I said, they're a little softer but not unexpected. As I mentioned, EasyCare Online, the compliance management system, continues to be well-received. And we are seeing solid uptake from both existing, as well as new accounts. And the EasyCare Online, I should point out, is also now available for bilevels. In this challenging environment, where there are changes in government reimbursement, coupled with mandates to bring down the cost of health care, products and programs, which provide superior therapy and better compliance, what bring the most value across the board to patients, customers and payers. Now with respect to interfaces, masks, our growth moderated due to -- and I think a number of you referred to this new entrance into the marketplace. However, Mask parts and accessories did very well in all geographies. But complete Mask systems sales were, in fact, a little softer. Both Philips and F&P have 2 new masks, as most people are aware. And as expected, they are being trialed by various customers. This is not a new experience for us. But as you know, we've been experiencing particularly good performance and market share gains in all of our Mask categories for quite some time. So things do tend to change. But more recently, the new competitive offerings, as I've already mentioned, are being tried by some of our customers. We are of a view, however, that these new entrants are not nearly as good as ours, but they are gaining traction as HMEs are willing to, as I said, try them. But perhaps equally importantly, or arguably more importantly, we faced a tough comparison to last year's third quarter's -- last year's third quarter, where growth in the Mask category in the Americas was 21%, and globally, it was 16%. So in short, a pretty big mountain to climb. However, as always, we plan to stay ahead of the game by constantly innovating. We provide -- we are going to provide, in the very near future, mask products that are smaller, quieter and more comfortable, and which we believe will keep us well ahead of the game. Our product pipeline is actually quite full, and we are releasing 2 considerably improved mask products this quarter with more to come during the remainder of fiscal 2014. In fact, we are extremely optimistic about these new interface innovations. Now coming back to home sleep testing. The number of commercially covered adult lives requiring pre-authorization for PSG continues to roll out, steering providers and patients towards HST. It is now well over 50% of covered lives and heading north. We estimate that at the -- or we estimate that at the end of calendar 2012, approximately 25% of all tests were HST, and we believe -- or our numbers are showing that this will be around about 40% at the end of our fiscal year June 30. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, averaging approximately 38% during the last 12 months, with a rise to around 47% in January in response, again, to pre-authorization. We are also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance. In fact, PCPs are becoming more involved with the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient and are also starting to drive momentum in the whole of the sleep business. So sleep market is not just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing, it is very much about forming partnerships with both customers and payers. A combination of our range of high-quality Flow Generators, the most comfortable and effective masks and accessories and easy to access robust data through the EasyCare Online, makes us an excellent value proposition. Not only do we have a robust pipeline of new masks, we have future technology innovations planned for both sleep and Respiratory Care. In short, we are at the forefront as leaders in innovation in the sleep space, and we have every intention to continue to bring to market the best possible solutions for sleep-disordered breathing. Finally, as I have said before, given recent data, which suggest that SDB, sleep-disordered breathing, affects approximately 25% of the adult population at some level and that the treatment -- the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, firstly, improves quality of life; secondly, slows co-morbid disease progression; and finally, reduces health care costs. It is, as I have said before, the holy grail of health care delivery. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick. Are you ready to make some comments, Mick?
Michael J. Farrell: I am. And thank you, and hello from London. This is a really exciting time for our team here at ResMed and not just because we had a Q3 revenue of $384 million, which represented 10% top line growth and 31% net income growth. However, with the fast growth of the global health care spend and its growing share of the GDP burdening many major global economies, both governments, as well as private payers are looking for answers to reduce the cost of the health care and to improve patient outcomes. We believe that at ResMed, we have the answer to these questions in the fields of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD and in other cardiorespiratory areas, particularly heart failure. I'd like to take just a couple of minutes to discuss 3 major growth horizons that we see in our future here at ResMed. The first growth horizon for ResMed is in our core SDB business. In the last 12 months alone, we have impacted many millions of lives in this space, resulting in around $1.5 billion in revenue. We will continue to grow the number of lives we impact each year along with our revenue. We are the global SDB market leader. We've talked before about SDB as a solid growing market and one that is incredibly underpenetrated. At most, it's 5% to 15% penetrated, meaning that 85% to 95% of the opportunity in our core business is still in front of us. As the global SDB market leader, we're in a great position to drive new market penetration and new market growth, geographically and to other co-morbidities, as you just heard. We've said it before. Our biggest competitor is not one of the other SDB manufacturers. It's a lack of education and awareness of the signs and symptoms of SDB, as well as the ability for physicians, particularly PCPs, to have practical medical action pathways. We're investing in changing that and ensuring that we have sustained, strong growth in our core SDB market. The second growth horizon for ResMed is our Respiratory Care business. This fast-growing business includes diseases such as COPD, as I mentioned before; neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS also called Lou Gehrig's disease. This Respiratory Care opportunity includes hospital and homecare ventilation, as well as hospital and homecare humidification. We have a leadership position in Western Europe with homecare ventilation. However, in the U.S. market, we have significant room for share growth. Combining Respiratory Care opportunities in the U.S. with those significant ones in Asia-Pacific, as well as Latin America, we have revenue growth potential in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. And there are many, many millions of patients with COPD and neuromuscular disease whose lives can be significantly changed with innovative ResMed technology. In that vein, we've just announced today, as you saw another press release in these last 24 hours, that we are launching the first and only bilevel device cleared by the FDA specifically for the treatment of COPD, one of the top 5 killers in the Western world. COPD sufferers now have a weapon in their fight to stay out of hospital. One of the biggest challenges for COPD patients, as well as their payers and physicians and for the health care providers that we serve, is to keep these patients from returning to the hospital after a COPD exacerbation event. More than 1 in 5 COPD patients are rehospitalized within 30 days. VPAP COPD has all the features of our higher-end noninvasive ventilation devices, including access to our cloud-based software system, EasyCare Online. EasyCare gives physicians, payers and HMEs the opportunity to monitor COPD patients, as well as our core SDB patients, it's the same platform, and intervene if there's a problem and potentially reduce cost and reduce rehospitalizations. Our third growth horizon is in the field of cardiorespiratory disease, but specifically cardiology and even more specifically, heart failure. As many of you know, we're running a large multinational randomized controlled trial or RCT in the heart failure space called SERVE-HF. SERVE as in a tennis serve and HF for heart failure. SERVE-HF is evaluating approximately 1,300 patients and is wrapping up enrollment over the coming weeks and months. In this 2-year follow-up study, we are looking at 2 primary outcomes: mortality and morbidity. We're cautiously optimistic that the data from SERVE-HF are going to show that ResMed's proprietary technology can save both lives and money, so to reduce the mortality and to reduce the morbidity. This is an enormous opportunity in the market space where heart failure and SDB intersect. At ResMed, we believe we have the best products, the best team and the winning strategy. We care about the health and the quality of life of our patients. We care about disease prevention. We care about improving outcomes, and we care about improving the economics of our somewhat broken health care systems. We are more excited than we have ever been that despite the challenges of current health care market dynamics, we at ResMed have the capabilities and the product pipeline to really make a difference. You'll hear me echoing many of the same things you've heard from Peter Farrell over the last couple of decades: our belief in ResMed's people, our world-leading product quality, our laser-like focus on innovation as well as solid science and clinical validation. Most important though is our shared vision for these 3 growth markets. We are proud to be leaders in SDB. And as you heard earlier, there is still so much room for growth in that space. I'm really looking forward to partnering in the office of the CEO with Rob Douglas, our COO, and with the rest of our CEO operations team, as well as with the almost 4,000 strong ResMed global team as we continue to drive increased value for our shareholders. The bottom line is that we have defined business plans, specific identified investments and key ResMed business leaders who are accountable for driving success in these 3 growth horizons I've talked about: SDB, Respiratory Care and cardiology. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Brett, who's in Sydney, to review Q3 in more detail. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: All right. Thanks, Mick. As we mentioned, revenue for the March quarter was $383.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter and also 10% in constant currency terms. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.1 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $84.9 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the March quarter was 62.4%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '13. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product and geographic mix and manufacturing and logistics improvements. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $109.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 8%, and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 29.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2013. R&D expenses for the quarter was $31.2 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be around 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2013, reflecting ongoing investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 23.1%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $215.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $168.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking our revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $95.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $119.8 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $114.6 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 9%. Masks and other sales were $53.8 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 5%. Cash flow from operations was $107 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $19.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20.7 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $67.3 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for consideration of $115.3 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 6.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. During the final quarter of fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 1 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $672 million. And at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion, and net equity was $1.8 billion. I'll now hand the call back to our operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I guess first one for me just on competitive bidding. Just wondering if you can give us some color on conversations you've had with BMEs following the rate announcements?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, David. That's a great question, and I'll probably hand over to Jim Hollingshead, the president of our Americas group to talk in more detail about the conversations as he took over the Americas during the last quarter. But to lead out on it, competitive bidding conversations have been ongoing with our customers over the last 2 years through round one that we're 2 years into and ended the conversations on, and into round 2, which as you said, the announcements came about around the -- with an apples-to-apples number, low 40% reduction versus sort of expectations in the 30s. We've had lots of conversations with our customers over these last 90 days as we have over the last 2 years, and the conversations really aren't any different than they were before, which is how do we work together, how do we find ways to get efficiencies out of the system that we can link up together to take cost out of the system, to link with our electronic data interfaces, our EDI, to get drop-ship to inventory sites, to work together to understand how we can help Medicare understand the return on investment from treating -- diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing patients. And of course, the topic of price comes up, but that comes up in every discussion with our partners. To frame this, as we always do on this call, and many of the analysts who are listening to this call around the mathematics on this, and we're talking about 20% to 25% of our Americas payers are included in competitive bidding. So I guess somewhere between 10% and 12% of our global revenue could potentially be impacted by this. So there's a lot of other elements that go into the price discussion for the other 80% to 90% of the business. But Jim, do you have any further detail that you might want to share with David with regard to conversations about competitive bidding round 2?
James Hollingshead: Sure, Mick. Thanks very much for the question, David. I don't have a lot to add to what Mick said. We were obviously talking to our customers about the issue of competitive bidding round 2 frequently, and nobody's happy with the extent to which reimbursements have been cut. And it does represent a cut in reimbursement portion of their business, but I do think it's fair to say that the more sophisticated HMEs out in the market understand that -- understand a couple of things. The first thing they understand is that there's a volume opportunity if they want contracts. The second thing they understand is what they need to do is drive efficiencies into their business. And so that tends to be the kind of conversation we're having with customers, is how we can help them. As Mick alluded to, how we can help them by providing solutions and services so that they can run more efficiently.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then just a quick one on the new Mask launches that you've talked about briefly on the call. Do you think that these -- do these address the Philips and Fisher & Paykel products that took a little bit of share in the quarter? And any additional details on -- are they nasal pillow, nasal, fullface, anything you want to share there?
Michael J. Farrell: So, David, that's a great question and one that the Philips and F&P and other competitors who are listening to this conference call would love to hear lots of details on. I don't think we're going give a lot of detail on that. I think we've said a lot in that our pipeline is very solid. We plan to launch 2 masks in this quarter, and there's a lot more in the pipeline to come. I'll hand over to Don Darkin maybe to give a little bit of color as to how our FX Series is holding up: Our Mirage FX, Quattro FX. These masks -- and Swift FX, have had incredible success for a sustained period of time, and we know that the market is sampling some of the competitive masks from our 2 major competitors. And we think that's a healthy competitive environment to have in the market. We're very proud of our #1 patient-preferred market position in the mask space, and we plan to defend it by innovating further and getting further ahead of where we were, which was in the lead. But, Don, any further color that you might want to provide David on the masks?
Donald Darkin: Thanks, Mick. David, we're pretty confident that what's coming out in the next few months is going to be more than adequate to cover what we need. I think more importantly, the actual pipeline itself over the next months, you're going to see pretty much what we've been planning on for some time now. And I think the competitive position for us will be more than adequate as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Two questions, if I might. First, on the COPD opportunity, how should we think about that in terms of revenue generation, for you all, in terms of magnitude and time frame?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. Great question, Ben. And we have a large focus on COPD, and I'm going to hand this question for further detail on to Geoff Neilson, who's the President of our Respiratory Care group. But just to lead out there, the COPD market opportunity is huge. It's the top 5 killer in the Western world. It actually I think just jumped up to #3, ahead of stroke, which dropped down to #4 in terms of how many people it kills in the Western world. But apart from that, it also costs the system a heck of a lot of money. And that rehospitalization, as many of you know, particularly in the U.S. market, there are serious penalties to hospitals for within 30-day rehospitalization events. We think we can help the hospitals, but also really help the patients and physicians who have trouble with these exacerbated events with our VPAP COPD product. And the market opportunity is in the triple digits, but I will hand over to Geoff to provide some more color for you there, Ben.
Geoff Neilson: Ben, thanks for the question. I think if you look at the number of COPD exacerbations, which are hospitalized every year, there is getting close to 100 million -- sorry, 1 million patients every year hospitalized for COPD. Around 400,000 of these are hypercapnia COPD patients, which means that they'd be suitable for NIV treatment post discharge. Unfortunately, because of the qualification criteria here in the U.S., not all of them can be qualified for NIV therapy. So we were estimating the market given the current qualification criteria in reimbursement to be in the order of $100 million annually in the U.S. So that's -- and this product, it is really focused at what the requirement is in the U.S. As far as the time frame goes, obviously, we've got to change some practices in terms of discharge, prescribing behavior. These patients can qualify direct from the hospital rather than going to the sleep lab, and so that's not a short-term activity and we do have a sales force in the ground that we're building up who's calling on the hospitals and the discharge planners with the discharge guidelines and education material to try and change that. But it's going to be a multi-year activity to build up our fair share of that $100 million market.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And so from a revenue per patient opportunity, is it a typical pricing for the VPAP plus kind of a mass replenishment model or is there a different reimbursement model that allows different pricing?
Geoff Neilson: No. So this is going to be reimbursed under EO 470, which is a standard bilevel without a backup rate pricing. So this device is specifically designed to meet the FDA criteria for respiratory insufficiency device, which as the device has indicated, for COPD. But for the first time, it's possible to prescribe on label bilevel device for respiratory insufficiency and do that straight from the hospital. So it's going to be a premium to your existing bilevel devices, but it's not going to be priced at a ventilator-type pricing.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And last question as I have other track I want to go on but how high is the bar for another company to get a similar indication?
Geoff Neilson: I think we could expect to get our fair market share of this. Clearly, it's possible for other companies to get these indications, and we've optimized our product specifically around treatment for COPD. But it's not impossible for others to do the same thing in time.
Michael J. Farrell: What I'd add on to that, Ben, is that there's some level of sustained competitive advantage from the VPAP COPD not necessarily just in the device, but also in -- as you saw in the press release and you heard in the remarks we just made, it's linked to EasyCare Online. Having a cloud-based compliance and adherence in management system that already has its market share growing in the core SDB space linking the VPAP COPD, not only with the whole S9 platforms. So all the humidifiers, tubing connectivity but also the cloud-based connectivity is there. We think that can provide some level of sustained competitive advantage. And as Geoff said, we expect to get more than our fair share of this large opportunity in COPD.
Geoff Neilson: If I can just add to what Mick said. So many of these patients are on oxygen with our new ClimateLine Oxy tubing, and we allow oxygen to be fed in there. That means we're optimizing humidification and therefore, comfort for these patients, which means that we enhance compliance. And that also means that we're reducing exacerbations and reducing rehospitalizations.
Peter C. Farrell: And maybe you can add a little bit more, Geoff, in the sense that we've also altered some of the characteristics for inhaling and exhaling. We won't go into details there, but we've really optimized the way the unit functions.
Geoff Neilson: Yes. So we've optimize the parameters and so on in the device, specifically for COPD, to make it easy to set it up because we want this to be set up directly from the hospital and not have to go through the sleep lab.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got you. Okay, and then briefly the other topic, I guess, is back to competitive bidding. Without getting too specific relative to fiscal '14, you've talked in the past about structural pricing being kind of the 3% to 4%. And then last couple of years maybe it was -- went to 6% to 8%. Is that sort of the level of expectation we should be looking at as this shakes out or is there a likelihood of a step function type of dynamic as we go through the resetting of some of these contracts ala 2007 that we can think about as people try to model both what pricing and then ultimately mix will do under competitive bidding?
Michael J. Farrell: Well, that's a good question, Ben, and I think you somehow got 3 questions in there by asking some sub questions around COPD. But the third question, competitive bidding yes, look, absolutely there -- are potential impacts on pricing. I think what we've said in past calls and at conferences and so on is that there's been sort of traditional 3% to 5% annual reduction, like-for-like reduction on products within the market. Could this push it to the high end of that range or even a little bit beyond it? Yes, certainly. I mean, that 5% year-on-year reduction in prices is something that we would present, expect and predict and plan for. Our job and this is something that our team has worked incredibly well on is to take more than that 5% or 5% to 6% out of COGS supply chain delivery. And we talk about the supply chain, meaning all the way from our factory to the delivered patient. So looking at the efficiency of the HME as well. So there could be some increased significant pressure, but it's not -- nothing different to what we've seen before and nothing that we weren't expecting and weren't planning for and have been executing on, I think, quite well through these first rounds of competitive bidding. So we see -- we think there'll be reasonably steady sailing through it, but we're ready for alternate weather reports.
Peter C. Farrell: And, Ben, just to add a little bit to that, maybe I've been smoking too much dope, but I don't recall any discussion of 6% to 8%, maybe somebody else has talked about that but there's no way ever talked about 6% to 8%. In terms of price reductions, yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So I guess I have heard some rumblings of some price or I guess reimbursement cuts in Germany from a couple of insurance companies over there, and I guess they were sort of doing tenders or something sort of similar to competitive bidding here in the U.S. So just wondered if you could comment on whether or not you've seen that and whether or not you've won any of those tenders.
Michael J. Farrell: Mike, thanks for the question, and I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to add more color. He and I have been spending a lot of time over here in Europe with our European operations team. Just as sort of a prequel to that, tendering or competitive bidding in different European countries happens on an ongoing basis. So we have tenders in places like Norway and the Nordic region that we participate in on an ongoing basis, and there has been some tendering in Germany. I wouldn't sort of put it as akin to competitive bidding, I'd put it akin to the other tendering processes that we've been managing and executing on for many years in Europe. But, Rob, do you want to provide some more detail on the specific question around tendering in Germany?
Robert Douglas: Sure, Mick. Okay, Mike, the German insurance industry is pretty fragmented. There's about 130 insurers. Even though they have been consolidating, that's still quite a lot. Recently, councils have put out request for tender, and they went through. Our competitors won those tenders, and they won them at pretty low prices that don't seem to include requirements for compliance monitoring or good patient service. We actually don't think that's very good care of the patient, and we don't think it's going to be a major trend in Germany. So we're keeping a careful eye on it, but we don't think it's the main thing for Germany for us.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then as the market in the U.S. moves more toward home testing and the primary care physicians get increasingly involved with those tests and writing prescriptions for CPAP, is there a risk that that's going to sort of erode the portion of these prescriptions that are branded and maybe give the HMEs a little more flexibility in determining what products they use on these patients?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, that's a good question, Mike. Certainly, with home sleep testing going from 25% of the tests to we think starting to approach 40% in the coming quarters and through the calendar year, there will be an increased influence, if you like, on the process of primary care physicians. Often, our specialist physicians still does read the study and often may make a recommendation on therapies. So the impact that specialists have in this field will not go away, but it will increase for the primary care physicians. This isn't something that is new to us, and we have been interacting with primary care physicians regarding sleep-disordered breathing for many years. We have actually some very specific programs, and I don't want to go into too much detail on this call. I don't know, Jim, if you want to provide some highlights of that, but we are working with primary care physician groups to make them aware not only of the disease state of sleep-disordered breathing, but also of the very important factor that if you're going to go from home sleep testing to positive airway pressure therapy, you're going to need to choose an algorithm that you can trust to deliver all night, every night for the rest of that patient's life. And you want to put your bet on an algorithm that has a lot of clinical validation, a lot of science and technology behind it because if you're saving money for the health care system by getting them to something that's going to keep them out of hospital, you actually want to keep them out of hospital. And the right technology is able to do that, and part of that technology is not only the algorithm, but also the data that can be taken from that algorithm, the information that we've taken to the cloud that can be used to manage that patient. And I think that's an area in terms of what I'm talking about specifically is our AutoSet algorithm and our EasyCare Online or health care informatics infrastructure. I think both of those are incredibly important factors that will weigh into the specialist but also the primary care physicians decision, and it's our job to educate them about the availability of both of those. Jim, did you have any further input or thoughts on the primary care physicians and our work with them going forward?
James Hollingshead: I just -- only a couple of things to add to that, Mick. I think that there will be a number of different models as different insurers shift to PSG to HST in different geographies and with independent physician groups, et cetera. So it's a complicated landscape. I don't think there's going to be a world where a primary care physician was utterly ignorant of sleep apnea is writing scripts for sleep apnea, right? There will always be some sort of influence model in there whether it's coming from an insurer or from a specialist who's read the study and is recommending the therapy and so on. And as Mick says, we have a number of programs underway right now, and I would say that some of them are early stage and we're experimenting. We have a number programs underway right now to drive awareness and brand awareness into the PCP space, but I don't think there's a huge risk associated with PCPs ending up as sort of arbiters in the space without knowing anything. It's really our job to educate the PCPs.
Michael J. Farrell: I'd say it's lesser risk and really an opportunity, Mike, and something that we've not only planned for but are starting to execute on, as Jim said.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just -- sorry to go back to the Germany question, but I just -- one quick follow-up on that. So is this -- you mentioned that there's been tendering in other countries in Europe. Have you -- is this the first time that there's been tendering in Germany or has that been -- have you seen that happen over the past?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, I think this is a first. Rob, you want to address it?
Robert Douglas: Sure, Mick, thanks. It has been going on in the past for quite a while quite. And as I've said, it's quite a fragmented insurance industry and while they are practically a common set of top-level rules, they have different practices in different companies and there has been tenders over the years there, and we've seen then come and go in the past as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just first question regards to, I guess, U.S. Flow Generators strength in the backdrop for the bidding. We've seen commentary out of Philips. In their first quarter results, they talked of a pretty tough U.S. landscape. You guys have done quite well. Can you talk about share gains, where they've been driven off the back of the informatics that you're pushing through and is that's obviously feeding into, obviously, the backdrop of competitive bidding? If I can just ask one subquestion to competitive bidding. Do you think you'll take your medicine upfront in terms of the private payers in terms of national accounts looking to negotiate now or do you truly see it staggered in line with the phasing of competitive bidding in both a CMS and the private payer sense?
Michael J. Farrell: Well, great, Matthew. So you gave me 2 questions all upfront. So we'll address them in order. So firstly, the Flow Generators share gains and then we'll get to the competitive bidding and upfront or staggered. So Flow Generators share gains. Again, I think Don Darkin might want to add some color after this, but just to start off, I think there are 3 major factors that are influencing our Flow Generators share growth. The first is home sleep testing is driving growth of the APAP category. ResMed has a leadership position in the APAP category with the S9 AutoSet device. So we're growing share in a growing category. That's point one. Point two, our S9 bilevels are now available across the board. And as you've heard from Geoff Neilson in his press release, in the last 24 hours, we added another S9 bilevel, and they're available all across the same platform. We think that we've had very strong growth across the high-end bilevels because the efficiencies that generates for our distributors, our customers and frankly, the value it delivers to the patient in terms of quiet, comfortable and efficacious therapy. And that's helped us on the VPAP ST, the VPAP Adapt, the AutoSet CS, the VPAP STA, and we believe it will help us on the VPAP COPD. The third point, as you alluded to, Matthew, is the health care informatics side. EasyCare Online and the cloud-based software that links into the VPAP COPD. We think that EasyCare Online in our core sleep disorder breathing market is driving added value for our customers that is leading to a preference for ResMed devices. And an important point on that is that is a sustainable competitive advantage, and it takes a long time to build up the capability and once you're ahead, you can continue to lead from the front. Don, any further thoughts or ideas on the Flow Gen share gains?
Donald Darkin: No, I think you covered it, Mick.
Michael J. Farrell: Okay. So the second question was around competitive bidding, and this I won't answer upfront, and I'll let Jim get to whether it's going to be upfront or staggered. I think there will be negotiations that happen on a daily basis with accounts with regard to pricing as the numbers came out over 30 days ago, we've already had many discussions with customers about -- for those who are winners, which those data only came out the number of weeks ago. So that's all public now. We know who the winners are. We can sit down and talk to them. We can bring out the playbook that we did in competitive bidding round one where we worked with winners, we helped them grow and we partnered with them on driving their ability to deliver with economies of scale. Jim, any thoughts on the question there with regard to medicine, upfront or staggered, Matthew's question on competitive bidding?
James Hollingshead: Yes, I think it's a good question, and I actually think it's a very difficult question to answer. As you say, Mick, negotiations are happening daily and the bid rates when they came out, they obviously create a ripple through the market and all of our customers' concern about reimbursement from CMS, and we're negotiating. One thing that I think works very strongly in our favor is that our products drive better compliance, and that's still a very important thing for the business model of all of our customers. And so we're going to continue to negotiate and work with our customers, both on pricing than on other things that we can do for the business. And we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we're very strongly positioned, and I think our customers recognize the value that our products bring to them, as well as our solutions like ECO. And we'll manage it as we can and we'll see how it goes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: I was wondering -- I had a follow-up question on EasyCare Online. I'm just wondering how much of a direct revenue driver is that or is it more you actually almost give it away and then it drives the uptake in APAP and CPAP as you've talked about?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Ian, that's a good question and, Don, I'll hand this over to you before going too far. EasyCare Online is a software provision that gives customers chances for efficiencies, the ability to remotely manage adherence in a way that is kind of unique and certainly serious value-add. I do think there is a very strong indirect influence on their choice of a Flow Generator because of that, and so that indirect strength is there. There are some direct revenues associated with the overtime AFEs and so on that we put through there but we're really focused on the innovation part that ResMed brings to the game, which is in the medical device field. But, Don, maybe want to talk to some of the other areas like our Umbian acquisition and the opportunities that we have with U-Sleep as well.
Donald Darkin: Thanks, Mick. Yes, it is a difficult one to try and understand whether there is actual revenue directly as we add people in ECO. Clearly, it has many functions that enable us to keep those customers in a position when we need them. With Umbian, it's a slightly different situation where we are, in fact, getting revenue from the use of Umbian. And as that software package grows, there will be other opportunities for us to see and measure. But at this point, it's a very difficult one to sort of track if that's answering your question.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: Yes, I was just trying to get a sense of whether -- you've had a very strong Flow Gen number this year, for this quarter in the U.S. I was just trying to get a sense of whether the EasyCare or the Umbian was a contributor there or is more just the underlying Flow Gen?
Donald Darkin: Yes. It certainly seems that way. But to actually put an exact track number on it's quite difficult at this point. And I think longer term, it will be easier to make a call on it. But for this stage, difficult.
Michael J. Farrell: So directionally, it's having influence, which is hard to quantify it, and I think is the short answer.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: All right. And my second question is around gross margin. I just wondering if we can get an update on how much of your production is now in Singapore and also if you could perhaps break out or give some idea of the gross margin improvement during the quarter, how much was product mix and how much was, say, manufacturing mix?
Michael J. Farrell: I'll hand over to Rob, and then he may hand over to Brett to give more details on gross margin contribution for the quarter.
Robert Douglas: Thanks, Mick. Yes, Ian, we continue to work on product cost, both on the incremental improvements and operating costs through the manufacturing system. The shift to Singapore continues to help. Our Malaysian factory producing headgear is working well. And of course, the product design teams really have a big impact on the cost of the products through as well. In terms of the exact mix of margins effects, I'll hand that over to Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Thanks, Rob. So if you look at -- if you kind of look at that year-on-year in both product mix and the manufacturing logistics improvements were both significant contributors. So we kind of don't break that down blow-by-blow, but both of them were meaningful contributors to that gross margin expansion this time.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division: And the mix of -- and how significant is Singapore now, is that getting up to 2/3 or 70%?
Michael J. Farrell: It's on a blended basis, it'd be approaching 60%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: One on EasyCare Online. I'm wondering how penetrated EasyCare Online is among the installed base. Is that only S9, and is there a way to transition S8 users into EasyCare Online?
Peter C. Farrell: Somebody want to take that?
Robert Douglas: Yes, I'll have a crack at it.
Peter C. Farrell: Go on.
Robert Douglas: It's a difficult one to actually answer in a sense of what penetration we have today. We've got several hundred thousand patients in the system. But when it comes to reverting back to S8, we don't intend to do that. Going forward, obviously, we'll be covering all of our new products as they come out. But I guess it's just a tough, tough question to answer that in this period. Again, as we go forward, it's going to become clearer where we're at. But today, it's quite a difficult one to answer.
Peter C. Farrell: But there are no plans to go back to S8s and...
Robert Douglas: No, no.
Peter C. Farrell: There's no need. EasyCare Online is about the present and the future. And of course -- I was just going to say, and, of course, some governments such as in France are starting to mandate that you need to have compliance there and even CMS with this 90-day rule where you've got to show 30 days continuous usage. That's also part of the influence EasyCare Online is meeting or is addressing. And the S8 is -- I mean, it's being phased out, if you like, or almost has been phased out.
Operator: Anthony's line dropped out of the queue, so we're just going to move on to our next question from Jason Mills from Canaccord.
Jeffrey Chu: This is Jeff Chu filling in for Jason. I wanted to focus on your operating margins for a moment. With regard to operating margin leverage, what is the company's medium-term target for operating margins on an organic basis? And do you see M&A as a viable driver of operating margin expansion for the next 2 to 3 years?
Peter C. Farrell: It looks like Mick's dropped off in London. So, Rob, do you want to?
Robert Douglas: Yes, I think the operating margin leverage question, we'll hand over to Brett because...
Peter C. Farrell: Okay. There's a bit of a ping-pong here. So, Brett, you're being thrown under the bus.
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. A lot -- those operating mix and targets and so on that we have is not something that we sort of publicly go out there with. But I would say -- I mean, clearly, we will look for operating leverage over time. You're certainly seeing that with, for example, SG&A spend, and you're seeing some margin expansion coming through as well. So they've really been driving out operating ratios and so on, which are in very good shape, and we will continue to do that. R&D, a little bit different. We'll absolutely invest in the product pipeline, and we'll invest on merits really from the ground up in terms of where we see gaps in the market and opportunities. So that one we look at it much more differently, if you like. But certainly, we're absolutely committed for initiative that are going to drive those operating ratios, but we're not out there on public records sort of disclosing what they are.
Jeffrey Chu: Okay, great. I have one last question. Did you pay the med tech tax during the quarter? And what are your expectations for the tax burden going forward?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Jeff, we're paying a small amount, but really I think I mentioned a quarter or 2 ago really that number if you look at it annually, it would be less than $1 million. Most of our products don't fall into the device tax.
Peter C. Farrell: Basically, it's a hospital issue and some of our products that don't sell directly to hospitals will fall under the medical device tax of 2.3% on revenues, but it's happily, it's not material for us.
Operator: We're at the 1 hour mark, so now I'll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.
Peter C. Farrell: Thank you very much. I'd just like to thank the team for their efforts, and once again, we have some first-class employees backed up by some first-class products, and we are very optimistic about the future. And so thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you in very good hands with Mick and Rob operating within the office of the CEO. We have an extremely strong productive and excellent team across the globe. And so thanks to all for their efforts. And that completes the call, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrean, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.
Constance Bienfait: Thank you, Adrean, and thank you all for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earning, new product development, or new markets for the company’s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed’s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company’s website at www.resmed.com. Please limit your questions to two at anyone time and then you can place yourself back in the queue. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell, ResMed’s Chairman and CEO. Peter, go ahead.
Peter C. Farrel: Thank you coming for that exciting introduction. Thank you again for joining us and I will begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Bret Sandercock, CFO for more financial details. And then of course, as usual take questions. So first, a brief financial summary, which as I said Bret will fill in the details a little bit more later. We finished with another extremely robust quarter, you might be well and truly tired of hearing this. But this now represents a 72 consecutive record quarter for 18 straight calendar years in which we have grown the top line. Global revenue in the second quarter of 2013 grew 13% to $377 million, up 14% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew 16% to $212 million and ROW revenue increased 10%, or 12% in constant currency terms to $165 million. We believe that our continued market growth has been driven by, primarily by two factors. First, the fact that more people are finally beginning to accept that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is in fact the major public health problem. And secondly our superior product quality coupled with our full solution offerings, which I will come back to in a moment. Net income for the quarter increased 24% to $78 million, while GAAP EPS increased 26% to $0.53 for the quarter. If we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54. Our global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven again by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels, and our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation products, the VPAP Adapt, as well as Stellar 100 and 150 products. And as we had originally anticipated, having our PAP products configured on the smaller quarter and more appealing S9 platform has worked out quite successfully. We also believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, as well as continued to gain back share in bilevels, and there is still a plenty of room for us to continue to grow. The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be adopted broadly and we are seeing solid uptick from both existing as well as new accounts. Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance, bring value to patients, customers, and payors. It’s all about driving outcomes for these constituencies and having the data to drive compliance and the hearings to improve lives and save healthcare costs is the right space to be. With respect to Masks, all categories continued to do well. Mask Accessories also grew quite strongly, but large and small HMEs continue to see the benefits by themselves and patients and being able to be more systematic about supplying replenishment products to those patients who need them. With the great success of our recent mask offerings, we are reaping the benefits of the great supply of these masks as patients remain happy to stay with what has been most comfortable and effective for them. And I’m proud to announce that on behalf of the ResMed team, ResMed has emerged as the most preferred mask brand based upon a statistically significant global study done in the timeframe, August to September last year by UK-based market research firm, DVL Smith. The sleep apnea patient survey with current PEP users and use their device for at least four nights per week and they were all using every mask top that is full face, nasal or pillows, and also that we are using all brands. Now immediately, we initiated and paid to the cost of the study, but we had no input whatsoever to the studies conclusions, so we’re very pleased about that. With that said, we are keeping a watchful eye on the recently released competitive masks. Also as an aside, we plan to launch our own suite of ResMed masks during the latter part of this year, or during this calendar year. Turning to the rest of the world and despite the fact that there is still a lot of economic uncertainty in Europe, the UK, and Germany and France in particular. These territories, Germany, France, and the UK delivered solid quarterly results. And regardless of the challenging economic climate and covenant fiscal restraints, the market is still focused on treatment which keeps patients out of the hospital and keeps them healthy. Sleep-disordered breathing treatment does this in spades. France has just initiated a new telemonitoring requirement to track complaints and we think this is an appropriate step and bodes well for us a period in the monitoring solutions. AutoSet CS, which is our Adaptive Servo-Ventilator product in Europe, and the Stellar products again did well in most parts of Europe. The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter with robust sales in Japan, particularly with Stellar and also AutoSet CS, our ASP product as I said, as well as the Bi-Level product portfolio. There is also great focus on compliance in Japan with data capture hopefully lessening the need for so many physician visits, or at least shortening the time the patient needs to spend in the physicians’ office. With respect to Ventilation, the VPAP ST-A is making inroads in most geographies. And as I’ve already mentioned sales of Stellar are quite robust, especially in Germany and Japan. In the U.S, we are in the process now of hiring respiratory care managers to go on referral points in hospitals. And we expect this to drive our home ventilation sales. On the HST or Home sleep testing front, about 60% of commercially covered U.S adult lives are now under a pre-authorization requirement for attended PSG or Polysomnography in an effort by payers to steer providers and patients towards HST. This is anticipated together 75% of commercially covered loss by the spring. We estimated the end of 2012 about 25% of all sleep tests for HST. And we expect this number to grow to 50% or over by the end of this calendar year. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST averaging about 35% in the last 12 months, which rose to 40% in November in response to pre-authorization enforcement. We are also involved in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance with PCP becoming increasingly more important in the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient. As flagged in the press release, we’ve been pioneering a market dynamic for several years that is now starting to get traction. The sleep market is not just about selling equipment in order to treat SDB, but it is about forming relationships with our customers, the HMEs and the payors. The combination of our range of high quality flow generators, the best and most comfortable masks and accessories and easy to access robust data makes ResMed in our view, the best value proposition for all providers. In short, we provide for full integration. The sleep market is one of the first healthcare markets to actually provide useful treatment data and has done so for about a decade. Good growth would account for using EasyCare Online is evidence of its value. We feel we are also getting traction with payors in making the case for CPAP therapy. With more understanding of the prevalence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing and obviously it’s association with chronic comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes, good depression and so on, the case to reimburse SDB therapy and authorization and continues resupply makes more and more sense. And as evidenced by the shift to pre-authorization to PSG, payors understand that HST is making sleep testing easier and cheaper for everyone. In addition, putting patients on Autoset rather than straight CPAP, even after in live sleep test is more efficient to the HME and in fact more effective for the patient. As recognized time and again treating SDB has proven to be preventative from multitude of other more severe and costly care comorbidities certainly more costly than simply treating sleep-disordered breathing. In short, it is easy to make a compelling case for the payors. As we’ve noted many times over the diagnosis and treatment of SDB is the holy grail of medical treatment for three reasons. It drastically improves patients’ quality of life, it slows down and even improves concomitant kind of morbidities and additionally reduces in patient and out-patient costs. Now, let me turn the call over to Brett for some additional financial detail, and then we’ll take question. So over to you Brett?
Brett Sandercock:  Great, thanks, Peter. Revenue for the December quarter was $376.5 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our second quarter revenues by approximately $4.1 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Income from operations for the quarter was $92.1 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $77.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 61.8%, up sequentially from Q1 FY13. On a sequential basis our gross margin continue to benefit from a favorable product mix. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 60% to 62%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $107.8 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency term, SG&A expenses increased by 8%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 30.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2013. R&D expenses for the quarter were $30.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses also increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1% compared to the year ago figure of 8.2%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting a continuing strong Australian dollar and also continued investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $9.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.2%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21% to 22%. On December 7, 2012, the IRS released their final regulations for the medical devices excise tax. Following our valuation in the regulations, we believe a relatively small number of our products are subject to the medical device tax and as such estimate the annualized financial impact from the tax to be less than $1 million. Turning now to revenue in more detail; overall sales in the Americas were $211.8 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $164.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 12% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments; in the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.7 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and Bi-Level devices. Masks and other sales were $118.1 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our masks product range and continued growth in accessories. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $108.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $55.9 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 16%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 13% while masks and others increased by 16%. Cash flow from operations was $93.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $19.3 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for consideration of $40 million. For the first half of fiscal year 2013, we have repurchased 1.2 million shares for consideration of $48.1 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 7.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. During fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 2 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our buyback program, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $657 million. And at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion. I’ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Dan Hurren – UBS:  Well, good morning, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I would just like to explore that a little bit about product launches and is there anymore detail on what product launches are required do you think to maintain growth as the comps gets tougher through the second half?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Dan, as you are aware, we’ve been on this kick for many years and then we typically come out with new mask offering, somewhere in the timeframe of nine to 12 months, and new devices tend to be more like 18 months to two years. So this was just continuing what we normally do, but the focus is on improving comfort, reducing noise, and also attending to reduce COGS. But maybe I will throw that question for more detail to Don Darkin, and Don, would you like to say a few words about product releases?
Don Darkin: This is Don. We’ve currently had a fairly robust pipeline over the last three to five years. We are really just following that plan out. We’ve got a number of offerings in all segments coming through this calendar. And it’s just wisely relying about as planned previously. So as Peter mentioned, they are addressing the main high points of mainly in comfort and costs. But essentially they will be – we are fairly comfortable that they will be through this fiscal end calendar year launching.
Dan Hurren – UBS: Okay, thanks very much. And one just that is on a different track. Can you just remind us again on the potential new flow from the SERVE-HF study et cetera?
Peter C. Farrell: Right. At the end of January we’ll be pretty much at the full complement of patients for the study. But and we’ve got some studies ongoing which probably won’t complete their patient requirements until the end of May. But we are looking at a – still a couple of years. We had a meeting on the cardiovascular space just this week. And people are feeling pretty comfortable with the compliances being addressed the way it should be addressed that the units mainly in Germany, but also Germany and France together with the bulk of all the clinical centers. We seem to be on track, and people are quite satisfied with where we are, but it’s still early days in terms of any results. Perhaps I could also add we are planning a study which will be run in the U.S., not on IFU or an indications for use study, that is not an FDA approved study, but a study done with a prestigious university, well, let’s say, I will give it out, Duke. And we are just dotting the Is and crossing Ts for Chris O'Connor, who is the Chair of Cardiology at Duke, not everything has been put to bed, but we are going to do a study which doesn’t have mortality and morbidity as the endpoints, but rather six-minute walk quality of life, injection, fraction and so on, and we are actually quite excited by that, particularly based on some of the data that I’ve referred to before coming out of Japan.
Dan Hurren – UBS: Okay. And we shouldn't expect any study this year?
Peter C. Farrell: And we think that’s a study that, what you said Dan?
Dan Hurren – UBS: I'm sorry to interrupt. I just said that we shouldn't really expect any sort of incremental news this year from those studies.
Peter C. Farrell: No, I wouldn’t necessarily. You will get a lot of – we expect a lot of good anecdotal reports, but nothing perspective, randomized controlled trial, peer review stuff if you like. But…
Dan Hurren – UBS: All right.
Peter C. Farrell: But we will still be keeping you up to date with, met our analyses and smaller studies, if you like.
Dan Hurren – UBS:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And we have David Clair online with questions from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just, Peter, real quick, where do you think we are in the mix shift that's kind of been benefiting the flow generators? I mean how much more room for shifts at the higher-end devices do you think we have here?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I think there is a fair amount of runway there David. I mean, it's sort of sticking your finger in the air to try to guess at it. But all I can say is the momentum is clearly there and you’re not going to see very much usage of sleep labs of pressure setting. And the fact is that there are now enough peer reviewed papers in the literature comparing our AutoSetting devices with fixed CPAP. And in fact, if you look carefully at the data, the data are more in favor of APAP than they are in favor of fixed CPAP in terms of compliance and compliance in terms of the number of hours patient spends on the device. And it really makes no sense at all given those data and we’ve sold – how many APAPs you think we've sold now? I know it's somewhere in the 2 million area. I mean it’s not like we haven’t got pretty of data on these devices. And it makes no sense to go to a sleep lab to have the pressure set. I mean it’s just you better off on an AutoSetting device, which is what we’ve been saying for the last decade and the data are now there to prove it. And it’s just an added inefficiency to go to a sleep lab to set a pressure. It’s an added expense, it makes no sense to send the money and you’re not getting any benefit, so we’d say continuing. And particularly now with 75%, shortly 75% of commercially covered lives requiring pre-authorization, this horse has got plenty of puff.
Dan Hurren – UBS: Okay. And then, for Brett, the tax rate guidance you provided and the gross margin guidance, I mean this quarter we were at the low on the tax side, and this is the second quarter in a row where gross margin has been north of that 61% midpoint. I mean, is this conservativism, or should we be expecting something in the back half of the year?
Brett Sandercock: Dan, I think as you can see, we've been sort of tracking at the high end of that range, and I suppose what I'd say is we're comfortable with that 60% to 62%. If you look at some of the product mix trends and they probably got some time to play out, then you could make the case that would be sort of the higher end of that range I suppose. But I would say, look, we're very comfortable with the range we’ve given. But as you can see that, trend-wise we’ve been at the higher end of that range.
Dan Hurren – UBS: And the tax rate, Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, the tax is really sort of reflects – sort of full-year tax calculations around the 21% to 22%, I think way we will be for the fiscal around that area.
Dan Hurren – UBS: Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, David.
Operator: We have Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse online with the question. Please go ahead.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Good morning. Can you hear me?
Peter C. Farrel: Yes, Saul.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Thanks. Peter, just picking you up on your comments about the data suggesting that CPAP, in fact, gives more compliance with the AutoSet training devices. Does that give you more confidence or any confidence that you might actually see a HCPCS code from Medicare for the APAP device?
Peter C. Farrel: Well, Saul, that's been in the hopper for so long, I mean it's almost since the birth of my first child. There've been so – CMS has just drawn a line in the sand on that. It would be nice if it were to happen. I just don’t see it. I mean we went – in years past, we spent a lot of time providing data going back and explaining that this is a completely different animal because it gives roughly a 40% lull of pressure through the night. It tracks to what the patient actually needs in the upper airway. And therefore, QED it's a different animal. And they just haven’t accepted the logic, so I don’t expect that to change. It will be nice, but I just don’t expect it to change.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks and just one last question is also for you, Peter. You had some good color on the adaptive fee or the AutoSet in Europe and Japan. I'm just wondering how is that adaptive fee going in the US, and is that a device where you really need to wait for that data from the SERVE-HF study trial to see meaningful sales there?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Saul, we’ve had data going back for almost a decade. And it's interesting when you look at the Japanese data and now it’s not. If you are looking at the U.S. market, the Japanese data would be considered not tight enough, not near the protocols, not enough focus on randomized control trials and so forth. But we did sort of introduce the data from 25 centers in Japan to various people here. And I’ve noted before that in Japan, cardiologists are actually doing the sleep studies themselves, I mean, it just so happens that the infrastructure there is conducive to that. But cardiologists are now putting patients onto adaptive servo ventilation treatment, the AutoSet CS without the patient having frank sleep disorder breathing. And the reason is that they maintain, well first of all, there’s been nothing new under the sun and in the treatment of Congestive Heart Failure for decades or at least a couple of decades. And they know that the drying out of the lungs, drying out of the pleura area around the heart and the patients are just doing much better. So we believe that by getting the word out to people that this will have an impact on the sales. Also, the fact that the SERVE-HF trials what we’ve seen particularly in Germany and France. What we’ve seen is the fact that you have seen your heart failure specialists who are involved in the study and they are seeing positive results with the patients and so we’re seeing an up tick in sales just by the fact that they are involving clinical trials. So you’re right, but I don’t think we’re not sitting back, waiting for a couple of years for a study to be completed. We’re out there marketing the products and we’re doing whatever we can within the law and within the regulatory environment to draw people’s attention to have valid, we believe these data are.
Saul Hadassin – Credit Suisse: All right, thanks a lot Peter.
Peter C. Farrel: Thank you, Saul.
Operator: And we have Ben Andrew from William Blair on line with the question. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: Good afternoon Peter.
Peter C. Farrel: Ben, how are you? 
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: I’m well thanks. A question for you relative to mix as well as kind of customer behavior, what chunk of the time do you, number one, see people start out a patient on an auto and downgrade them eventually just to kind of switch out that cheaper device? I understand the clinical argument favored, but what percent of the time do you actually see that? And do you anticipate it getting a bit more difficult to make the economic arguments after we get implementation of Round 2?
Peter C. Farrell: Gosh, Ben, I just we have no visibility to those sort of data at all. But look – asking, I mean I am not aware of any large scale switching to – I mean, I know some of the hybrid DMEs will use AutoSetting and then switch the patients to cheaper device, but I'll throw that to Mick, do you have any comment?
Michael J. Farrell: Yeah, Ben, that model may have applied five to 10 years ago with the ratio of an AutoSet to CPAP device was three to one. Now, you are talking more like a 1.25 to 1 and the delta, the price difference between the two, given the whole price compression that's been happening that 3% to 5% we talked over these last years is a minimal delta and $75 at least to get somebody to go to the patient's home and change the device and then you’ve got to ensure the settings are right, and you can have complications and return visits. So the economic argument has driven to first time setup on APAC with all home sleep testing, but as we said in the preamble, some PSG testing is now looking at APAP applicator as well. And it’s because it drives compliance, adherence, and keeps the patient on therapy and adapts the changing needs, breathing position, change in drug regimen, change in weight, many, many factors. So the mix shift from CPAP to APAP is industry wide and we believe that plays to our strengths where the Autoset is superior to its competitors in that category, and they really are very few players, I would say, looking at a VPAP or APAP initial period and then moving a patient down to basic CPAP, because of the long-term complications that they see in the changer and long-term upside basically in iPad keeping the patient on therapy and keeping the patient out of hospital for payer and high quality life of the patient and for HME keeping them coming back to order replenishment masks and accessories.
Brett Sandercock: So I guess you can summarize it then most things the inconvenience in with the current build between what does it cost you for an AutoSet and what it cost for a regular CPAP. But I mean it’s kind of like wide boarder?
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: Okay. And then, Peter, have you guys had conversations with any of the larger homecare dealers or even the GPOs that address some of those groups relative to their approach after Round 2? And again, we know the experience in Round 1. We've heard you guys answer that question quite a few times. But what sort of differential do you expect when you increase it by a factor of 10, and what sort of conversations are you having? Thank you.
Peter C. Farrel: Well, I haven’t had conversations. We all through that to Dave, Dave has been thinking about Round 2 quite a bit and maybe making comment. But Dave do you want to go first on that.
David Pendarvis: Sure, Ben, with regard to this use of AutoSet in connection with home sleep testing. I think a lot of that’s occurring more on the commercial side rather than the Medicare side. For example all of the pre-authorization requirements that have been a large part of driving the shift towards more at home diagnosis is on the commercial side, not on the Medicare. So I’m not sure any reimbursement changes on the therapy on the Medicare side really going to have a significant impact on this mix shift to auto. But certainly we have conversations with trade associations about what should we be doing as an industry together with converse or with CMS and others about affecting competitive bidding on the progress and how CMS is rolling it out and how the various bills that are in Congress are passing. So we’re certainly talking with them about those types of issues. But I guess I would throw to make in terms of actual behavior. But I think our customers have gotten pretty comfortable overall with the idea that competitive bidding is coming in other MSAs that they didn't have it before. They don’t expect any large change in terms of customer behavior either in terms of how they’re guessing patient needs or equipment selection equipment selection or how they’re focusing on the business generally.
Unidentified Company Representative: The only thing I add to Dave’s comments, which is right on track is that, we’re partnering with customers. We have discussions with them everyday about the processing environment Round 2 could not have been more publicized, probably, frankly more so in our investor and analyst community than it is with our commercial discussions that we have on a daily basis, because its part of the course. We know its happening. We know its going to hit July 1. Obviously they like on saying what the results were as they work through those results. But we’ve been having discussions with customers over the last two years on this. I know you asked not to use that expense in those nine cities for the 91, but as the business guy been involved in this, we have experienced that those discussions happen. We partnered with the winners. So what we plan to do, when it goes 10x is partner with the winners again. And we have a pretty good idea of who that will be. The partners who think about long-term compliance and adherence and the people who will pick up those orphan patients from some of the small folks, who may go out of business, so we know the plan, we have got it ready to put in place and we partner with our customs on it. So to summarize, Dave’s point, we are looking at the AAHomecare and the large industry groups, but we are also working with customers on the second front on a daily basis and we’re ready to grow through competitive bidding on too.
Benjamin Andrew – William Blair & Company: Great, thanks guys. 
Operator: And we have Matthew Prior from Bank of America online with the question. Please go ahead.
Matthew Prior – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Hi good morning guys. My two questions, are you guys focused on the contracts that you make? Mick, I guess compared to bidding Round 2, there’s been several delays. Can you give us any kind of thoughts you have around timing for the announcement of that? And just I’m really interested in the pricing dynamics between CPAP and APAP given some manufacturers are pushing out lower pricing on CPAPs, you’re focusing on APAPs, HST forces the APAP to switch, and I guess I’m concerned somewhat that you could see more pricing aggression in CPAP that could drag down APAP as they fit under the same code?
Michael J. Farrell: Yeah, although I mean they are both on the E0601 code and we talk about that earlier, that’s not going to change. We tried that five times. But the mix shift to APAP will continue. There will continue to be price pressure on both CPAP and APAP in a competitive market that what’s happens. Unfortunately, we don’t have any special intel as to why Washington is moving slowly, other than if the government and they’ve got 10 times the number of data coming through and probably the payment wasn’t much bigger than Round 1 looking at it. So we don’t have a date as to when that’s going to come. But we’re reasonably confident in our range of expectations as to what the reductions will be based up on Round 1 and some good surveys have been done across the group. But we’ll see the data when we come to it. In terms of low-cost players in the CPAP space and its impact on APAP, there is certainly an impact there. But if you don’t have an APAP, you can’t compete in the category of the market requires an APAP. So it’s really two or three horse race, maybe four in that space. But it’s a category that we plan to grow, and we have the best algorithms, and we’ve done well so far. Connie, I don't know if you've any further intel into what’s happening with CMS on that front?
Constance Bienfait: As Mick said, we expect that any day now as it’s later than fall. So we’re hearing noises that maybe next week. But we don’t know anything more than the rest of you.
Matthew Prior – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, Thanks. That's good to hear to the extent they're keeping it all under wraps. But I guess my second question just focusing on that issue of compliance and more so informatics. Can you talk to what percentage now of the second and third tier DMEs are running a compliance system like EasyCare Online, and in your discussions with them in the late uptick competitive bidding? Do you think that's going to be a market share winner for ResMed or the other players?
Peter C. Farrell: I’ll hand the second part of this question on to Don Darkin, because his team put together the healthcare informatics play EasyCare Online, which is penetrating across the group, but in terms of looking at the T’s of HMEs in the U.S. market particularly, but across the America as the EasyCare Online was introduced, we had districts customers who have been on this platform for five to six years, who switched over within months, some of them weeks on to EasyCare Online. The value proposition of EasyCare Online of having data available immediately in a very sort of outside Apple like user friendly iTunes like user friendly cloud environment has been incredibly powerful for not only the providers, the adjuvant providers, but really importantly the physicians who write the prescriptions and have access to those data. And in future, to our customers’ customers, for the providers to provide those data to payers and even in the future to patients as well, but specifically two questions, second and third tier, sort of large regional in the mom and pops really have started to adopt EasyCare Online because it’s simple, it’s easy, and it’s available, and more and more prescriptions for connected S9 devices with wireless capability are coming to market, but those things been costliest sort of S curve adoption in EasyCare Online. I don’t know Don, if you have any further comments on Hi or EasyCare Online?
Don Darkin: Yeah, thanks Pete. Matt, we are pretty impressed with the uptake. In fact, it has gone much quicker than we expected, and it's pretty much of sort of provided across all the DME groups. What we are seeing now is a slight connection between the uptick on the data for EasyCare Online and a push in the growth as well in that space. So we’re quite pleased with that position. And I’m expecting with a small – we’ve got a bunch of pending releases within that space both with EasyCare and some other software that we would continue to see a pretty big up tick in the adoption of that which also actually helps us with moving towards the APAP space as well for the data, so pretty positive.
Peter C. Farrell: And Matt just to add a bit more flavor you know on the issue of price pressures and cheaper products being available, if these guys can offer interim solutions and the robustness of the data management and the algorithms, I mean we’re just not seeing – look, I’m not saying we’re complacent, that’s the last thing we are, but we just don’t see this as being a big deal.
Constance Bienfait: One other quick note on the timing Matt, the CMS has planned a bunch of webinars for the bidders and other constituencies in February. So if the numbers don’t come out soon, they’re going to have to push back the schedule for the whole year quite a bit.
Matthew Prior – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: And we have Bruce Du from CDN on line with question. Please go ahead.
Bruce Du from – CDN: Thanks, guys for taking my question. Just in terms of the masked replenishment, I know you've given some update before, but you don't have sort of great detail in terms of end-user replacements. But can I ask in terms of the sort of US mass replenishment rates, what do you think the market is at currently and in particular whether or not you've come to see sort of more, some of the small to midsize DMEs really starting to push the replenishment story?
Unidentified Company Representative : Well, there is no question that people are saying it as an opportunity and the more compliance improves and we have seen compliance improving effect talking to a guy who runs a small service company in Atlanta this morning and he surprised me by saying that they compliances 90%. So if you are getting that sort of compliance, you are going to obviously see impact on replenishment.  And if you get right back to when CMS changes the rules and you got a share 30 days consistent years within 90 days period of a patient put on CPAP, then you are forced to get into the health informatics or at least track what’s happening and that also cause people to improve their compliance. So that also has a very positive impact on replenishment, but the latest data I saw were it’s still of the order, in fact a little less than two masks, two cushions per patient per year, but I will turn to Mick for further comments. 
Michael J. Farrell: Yeah Bruce and actually this dives back into Matt’s question about the different tiers of HMEs right, so the large nationals, to the quantification, the large nationals have all adopted replenishment and I would say are executing pretty well on the current sleep test and we are working and partnering with them on that. The large regions, more than 50% of doctors, but there is still a lot of runway left on that large regional space. The mom and pops very much under penetrated in this space and we through EasyCare Online, that’s where it ties into Matt’s question, through EasyCare Online penetrating its way into that that sort of mom and pop and small regional space will give them the facility and capability and some other software elements that don’t into that that’s linked to our Umbian acquisition and usually platform is that start to become available throughout the HME space can give far more capability for this masked replenishment to take off. So if reimbursement allows 12 cushions per patient per year and we are solved two cushions per patients per year, and we are sub two cushions per patient. You can see there is a lot left on the runway and mask systems is more penetrated, but that cushions area, there is a lot of work to drive, no matter what happens on the reimbursement front. So it’s a balance across that and we are looking at how we empower the whole spectrum of our HME customer group across the small, medium and large segments and we have a team that is dedicated and focused to doing a consultant sales team that focus on this phase. So we are not just talking about it, we are taking action. 
Bruce Du from – CDN: Great. And just my second one was just in relation to your early comments in terms of potentially some masks product launches towards the end of this calendar year. Just I guess, the recent product launches you've seen from your competitors, I guess what are you seeing in terms of the feedback and how they're doing in terms of the nasal pillow category and also the full face mask category with some of those guys have launched? What are you seeing from the competitor products thus far?
Peter C. Farrel: Well, you probably saw one of the analyst reports was that in the last day or so, comparing the quality of the masks and across the Board, whether it’s full face or whether it’s nasal pillows or the nasal masks and Mirage effects, we are just significantly above the others in terms of patients and physician acceptance. So our current offerings are actually pretty damn good, but you can always improve and Don and I were chatting just before Christmas or around Christmas while I was in Sydney and Don was showing me through the new masks in the hopper and they are just hugely impressive, but even without talking about JFU I think what we’ve got now is pretty good, you will in the future, we are not doing that, we continue to make improvements.  Now when others release masks typically what we get at is, we got go hope, people are going to try them, but so the Respironics offerings and they got offerings across those three spaces, full face and pillows and nasal. But we are still seeing better acceptance of our comp products and we expect that to continue. So you’ve got a blip, people try stuff, but now we are seeing it reverse. 
Bruce Du from – CDN: Great thanks.
Operator: We’ve Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities online with questions. Please go ahead. 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: Thanks. I have trouble pronouncing it, too, sometimes. I guess, first of all, I guess I'm just curious there has been a lot of focus on the mix shift that you are clearly benefiting from with all the higher end products, but you know to the degree you're able or willing to answer it, I'm curious what you think the actual volume growth is in the market, both US and outside the US? Because, you know, the checks that I've been doing indicates that volume growth is actually pretty low, and obviously with these mix shifts, maybe you don't need a lot of volume growth, but I just want to see if I'm missing something, or does that seem reasonable?
Peter C. Farrel: Well, in terms of growth rates, we haven’t changed in the last couple of quarters, based on the information that’s coming from a variety of sources to us. So European growth is somewhere in the vicinity of 4% to 6%, 6% to 8% in the U.S. and maybe little nudged up a little higher in Asia/Pac, 8% to 10% in terms of the overall market growth in terms of the volume of devices. Now in terms of our specific business, no question that the benefit of HSTs to AutoSet is a huge plus, and as you know and we mentioned in the press release, all our products are now in the S9 platform, that is we’ve seen this has had an extraordinary positive effect on the CPAP ST-A, but also on the adaptive servo ventilators, I mean we can bear in mind, there we went from an S7, which is almost like a car battery by comparison to this much more user-friendly lighter. There were some changes in algorithm as well, we have gone to order rate, but so we have made improvements in both the size and to lesser extent the algorithms. And we're seeing if you like our Bi-Level business is coming back to where we believe it should be. And Michael, do you have any thing to add to that?
Michael J. Farrell: Yeah, hi, Mick and we saw your report that came out. I think one thing that when you look at the volumes and what the growth rate is and when we say the revenue growth rate in the Americas in 6% to 8%. It maybe that the volumes are slightly higher than that, I mean we have got mix shift as a positive, but then you’ve got ASP declines in the 5% range that is a negative factor on that as well. We haven’t talked publicly about volume numbers within devices, because we’re the only public company that goes into this space, and whatever information we use is heard by our competitors, but we don’t get the flip side of that. But I think one area that maybe worthwhile adding to your research area is the leakage that happens throughout the pipeline when a patient goes into the pipeline. And patients sometimes when they get the referral onto PSG or HST leak out the system. Our research has shown when you have a choice between home sleep testing, particularly in PSG and even just offering the HST. You get less patients leaking out of the system. So that would argue that even without the macroeconomic environment improving, which we think it probably is, you have that chance for lower leakage has HST goes from 12% a year ago to 25% this last calendar year to our projections are that is 35%, 45%, even some optimists at 50% by the end of this calendar year. So that leakage rate, we expect to reduce as home sleep testing comes to market. So that’s just another parts put in the equation of patient flow volumes.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: All right, I guess I’m still a little confused just because it sounds like now you’re seeing that the pricing, obviously peer price has been down. But I assume mix was more than offsetting that, maybe the difference is you’re talking about the market more broadly, instead of ResMed specifically. But all right, so I guess my other question is just on Singapore. What portion of your production is going through Singapore at this point, and how much higher do you think that can go?
Peter C. Farrel: Well, we’re north of 15%. We’re heading to 75% and I don’t know Rob, do you want to make a comment on that?
Robert Douglas: Yes Mike, it just stays as part of the long-term plan. We are putting growth in our production into Singapore, we're holding other facility steady. What will happen is we'll hit some capacity living in Singapore and then evaluate our next steps. But it’s clear to say, that could easily go to 75%, but it will happen steadily and incrementally. We are also running production in Malaysia of headgear that was the result of an earlier acquisition of some business, so that’s picking up that number a bit as well and our supply teams continuing to work on that strategy but in our growing business we can do this in a very organized way.
Unidentified Company Representative: And a little bit of advertizing here for Singapore, last month I was down there and had the pleasure meeting with the economic development board at least their healthcare sector people. And when the Singapore government talks about business and government and academe working together they actually walk to talk and then nice to the other countries where we’re doing business, the United States or Australia they has done walk to talk, it’s more of an anti business environment there like, it can be with taxes or unionization of whatever it is but the Singaporean government, they’re just a pleasure, an absolute pleasure to work with 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: All right, thanks a lot. 
Operator: And we have David Low from Deutsche Bank online with a question, please go ahead 
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Thank very much. Just a question on, we heard a couple of stories that Respironics have experimented with a direct to consumer model. Just wondering what ResMed’s view is of that and whether you’ve benefited from any backlash from the, say the Respironics side pushback 
Unidentified Company Representative : Well you know if you go back a couple of years ago maybe three or four years ago, Philips actually flagged if they were looking into direct-to-consumer, so we weren’t surprised by this statement to be honest. And Kroger is probably not a bad month to go where we have got 2000 outlets. But look I have heard a couple of stories that, there was one of the big DMEs and I listen you guys and they immediately withdrew, but then we heard that they only withdrew from the stores which were advertised, and it was still ongoing, but, Mick, you are closer to this than I am.
Michael J. Farrell: Hey, look, I think it’s a great question about Philips. Basically, for those on the call who may not know, Philips worked on a pilot experiment with supermarket/pharmacy chain called Kroger's, and they’ve sent a letter to the industry about this, I am not breaching anything to this, they have made public. Their approach and experimentation with a pilot trial with a mass retail channel was provocative in a market. The immediate question from customers to us was, well, are you guys going to follow and we said no and here is why, we think it’s all about compliance and adherence, and ensuring that patient gets the best setup and the best chance to stick to seek that therapy. And that conversation with a physician, respiratory therapists, or some specialists in the space upfront talking about the comorbidities, heart failure, heart attack, hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity upfront drives adherence. And the other part of it is just simple business models and what’s won. When you look at brick and mortar book stores, they are going out of business, the Amazon. So why would a patient who is compliant and happy with their mask want to pickup a cushion at Kroger's when they include if let’s say, the HME had setup a good replenishment program and you could just click 1 on your phone or press Yes on a text or click on an iPhone app that maybe the HME had provided or through EasyCare Online or I’m getting it provided for the patient. So we think the best business model will win is the one that drives best compliance and adherence, showing the return on care and that is better business model HMEs and it’s a wake-up call for HMEs. So if you don’t service the patients with cash model options, right, where it’s beyond reimbursement high deductible health plans, that someone else will fill that need. So there wasn’t a huge backlash in the quarter. Our growth numbers were based on solid performance. But it was an interesting experiment and it helped us create some conversations with our HMEs about reimbursement, cash business and replenishment that we think it was in line with our conversations before and was a catalyst for further discussions about maybe penetrating those large regionals and large mom and pops as to and even the small guys about how to drive replenishment, because if you don’t do it, someone else will. That was a sort of experiment and summary from outside.
Peter C. Farrel: And if you’re looking at direct to consumer, I mean one thing you could think more about is that to be more along of lines of a diagnostic system, in other words, something alerting to you that you have poor sleep quality or whatever and that’s along the lines of sort of buying something in an Apple store or getting something from Omron measuring the wellness in this wellness category and then directing you to go to a sleep level, go to a sleep position or whatever. And to Mick’s point, if you don’t get compliance, we all lose. And we’re, frankly, pretty delighted with what we’re hearing about compliance now, and surprisingly the government actually did something sensibly. So we’re even more surprised at that. But the CMS, the 90-day, 30-day continuous user steam has been a positive of the marketplace. 
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Great. That's very helpful actually just on that same theme. Peter, you mentioned in France a change in requirements on telemonitoring. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what's exactly going on there, please?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, we are using the check book to force people to do data monitoring. You are going to get paid less if your device doesn’t provide the appropriate telemonitoring, but Rob maybe you can say a few words about that. But we consider – we are on lovely, I mean really strong position with EasyCare Online and U-Sleep from Umbian and so on, but Rob do you want to add some more flavor?
Robert Douglas: Yeah, I’d say the French bodies that are managing it, it really gets the economic case about sleep apnea and they want to make it even more efficient to treating, so there's been a discussion going on for about a year to implement this requirement for wireless monitoring effect of all patients and its been a tough discussion throughout the year, but its now reached a position where we know what to do.  We have actually got our EasyCare Online system running in France and working well and we’re going to provide the best online monitoring and the most efficient online monitoring service in France. It’s going to be a very good solution that we will be providing there and the French authorities want to see this start real soon, and around the middle of the year, they will be expecting all new patients to be wirelessly monitored to seek development. 
Peter C. Farrell: And there is an economic incentive for people to do it for the healthcare providers, because they get paid more or they paid less if they don’t provide this. And so well actually, they will go out of business 
Robert Douglas:  The reimbursement effectively changes midyear. You get paid less if you’re not offering data monitoring
Peter C. Farrell: Well, the French reimbursement model, is sort of a fixed regular weekly fee, and that has got a plan for where that goes. And over time, like all issues in business, gradually decreases. But the rates, it won't decrease if you're on the telemonitoring. So it’s an effective price differential coming in there for that.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.
Peter C. Farrell: Thank you, Adrean. Yeah, thanks everybody for listening and I think we will call it quit. And except to say that another great quarter from our team and I want to congratulate all ResMed employees for doing just an absolutely splendid job once again for our 72 record quarter; that’s now 18 years, I sound like a broken record. So it’s a pretty good record, which we are extremely proud of. So thanks to the guys and the team.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. You may begin.
Constance Bienfait: Thank you, Christine, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets of company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. Please limit your questions to 2 at any one time, so that we can accommodate as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO.
Peter C. Farrell: Great. Thanks, Connie. I'll begin as usual with a summary and then turn the call over to Brett to go through the numbers in a little more detail. And then if there's any time left, we'll take questions. Just kidding about that. First, finances, we finished with another very solid quarter. Global revenue in Q1 '13 grew 8% to approximately $340 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew an encouraging 15% year-over-year to $194.4 million. ROW revenue at $145.4 million grew 9% in constant currency terms, and we believe that our superior product offerings continue to drive our growth as does awareness of the seriousness and importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea. Net income for the quarter increased 41% to $71 million, while GAAP EPS increased a robust 48% to a record $0.49 for the quarter. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.50. And I should note that the net income figure of $71 million is actually 21% of revenues, which shows a pretty solid performance. With respect to product performance, I'll start with masks. Again, all mask categories showed strong growth across all geographies. Accessories also grew strongly, as both large and small DMEs and HMEs are becoming more systematic and effective with resupplied patients who need them. With the success of MS recent mask line, we are seeing the benefits of the replenishment of these masks, as patients are happy to stay with what is most comfortable and most effective. Global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven again by AutoSet but also bilevels and VPAP Adapt, our adaptive servo-ventilation product. We are seeing excellent acceptance also for our new high-end S9 products from physicians, especially cardiologists. In the Americas, the S9 AutoSet and the VPAP Adapt ST did particularly well. Growth in the Flow Generator segment was also driven by a continued positive mix from basic CPAP to APAP due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing, as well as physician preference to put patients on AutoSet since it provides flexible therapy but also improved patient comfort, as well as enhanced compliance. The new EasyCare Online system, which helps compliance management, continues to be well received, and we are seeing a solid uptake from existing but also new accounts. With new technology and superior algorithms, we believe we are taking Flow Generators, and EasyCare Online are certainly one of the benefits which our customers value. There is still uncertainty in Europe, but many countries had very good quarters, especially the U.K., Germany and the Nordics. Despite the challenging economic climate throughout all of Europe, as well as the fiscal constraints therein, the focus is still on treatment that keeps patients out of hospital and keeps them healthy. Our Stellar products did well again this quarter, and EasyCare Online is also gaining traction. We are continuing to see attention and focus on cardiology and its connection with sleep-disordered breathing. There was also a great deal more focused on compliance, especially in France, which, of course, positions us well with our high-quality products. In Asia Pac, we also had a solid quarter, particularly in Japan, due to sales in both Stellar and the AutoSet CS, which is equivalent to the Adapt product sold in the U.S. With the increase in reimbursement in Japan for respiratory and bilevel, we are seeing solid growth in the high-end Flow Generator line. Japan is also very focused on compliance and ensuring that the patient is using the therapy. We are also planning to replicate the Japanese cardiology model, if possible, in other parts of the world. Cardiologists see the quality of life improved on adaptive servo-ventilation therapy, even independent of the level of sleep-disordered breathing, that is in half-value [ph] patients. In short, we're seeing that cardiologists in Japan are actually using adaptive servo-ventilation to dry up the lungs and the pleura, independent of the extent of the sleep-disordered breathing. Emerging markets like India, China and the Middle East also did well in this quarter, with encouraging sales, in particular, of ventilation products in India. Ventilation sales again of Stellar 100 and Stellar 150 continue to grow, especially in Europe, Latin America and, as I indicated, in Japan and India. We are still awaiting regulatory approval in other geographies. Stellar is a very competitive noninvasive ventilation offering for the emerging markets, and the Stellar 150, which includes iVAPS, the intelligent Volume-Assisted Pressure Support system, which is our new automatic bilevel mode, is being extremely well-received. In the humidification area, the HumiCare D900 is now fully launched in Europe and is also being well-received, and we have made our submission to the FDA on the D900 as well. With respect to sales of Stellar products in the U.S., we've decided to discontinue our distribution partnership with CareFusion. It was a mutual decision, and it will allow both of us to more closely align the activities of our field organizations with the priorities of our own businesses. We continue to invest in the development of an advanced ventilation products, and we'll sell the Stellar products and HumiCare D900 to institutions through our own respiratory care sales force. And we've already begun to build that sales force. Our strategy is to sell Stellar into institutional care settings and provide homecare patients with our VPAP ST-A also with iVAPS. And just by parenthetically there, the VPAP ST-A with iVAPS has been approved for respiratory insufficiency, and we've launched this with the S9 platform. Our new Narval mandibular repositioning device, which was recently launched in the U.S., is being well-received, but it is, of course, early days. However, the Narval products, well-received in Europe where it's already been launched. On the home sleep testing front, by next month, 4 out of 5 of the largest commercial payers will require prior authorization for attended PSG in an effort to steer providers and patients towards home sleep testing. United goes live in all its territories, which constitutes 34 million lives on November 1, and certain regions under the world point plan will have the requirement in place by November as well. As a result, 70% of covered lives will need pre-authorization for PSG, and we estimated that in 2011, about 15% of all sleep tests were HST. We expect to see this at around 25% by the end of this calendar year. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, over 30% in the last 12 months and 41% in August. We're also participating in primary care physician awareness, as HST continues to advance with PCPs becoming more involved and more important, in fact, in the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient. Self-reported data suggests 10% of PCPs are using 1 of the 3 HST models, that is sleep lab HST, IDTF, mail order HST or PCP direct HST. And another 40% are evaluating HST. So we'll continue to grow. In addition to the studies mentioned in the press release on how diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing can improve health care outcomes, lower hospitalization and readmission risks and also reduce medical expenses, CMS is rolling out 2 major pay-for-performance programs to cut readmission rates and improve hospital care overall. Hospitals with high Medicare patient readmission rates for heart attack, heart failure, as well as pneumonia, will face penalties, and those penalties are slated to grow over the next 3 years for hospitals that fail to drive down readmission rates. Whether it stays in place or works out is a question, of course, but the premise is good and the clinical data show treating sleep-disordered breathing does bring down hospital readmission. And that bodes well for us. Finally, David Pendarvis, Glenn Richards, our Medical Director, and I attended the second meeting at the Society of Anesthesia -- Anesthesiology and Sleep Medicine, which was held 2 weeks ago in Washington, D.C. The conference shows continued interest by clinicians in the perioperative management of sleep-disordered breathing. In fact, data presented showed that patients with sleep apnea have a significantly higher risk of post-surgery complications, ranging from longer hospital stays to even death. Several leading institutions, particularly the Mayo Clinic and Northwestern University, have initiated protocols to screen patients going under the knife for sleep apnea and to monitor and treat those patients after surgery. Their protocols we've had are extremely impressive, and we aim to collect some more detail from both these institutions. All of the peer-reviewed literature continues to make it abundantly clear that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is at best, seriously debilitating and costly to the health care system and, at worst, life threatening. These findings add to the continually mounting evidence connecting serious health disorders to untreated sleep-disordered breathing and point to the necessity of making the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing a standard of care in all medical practice. At this point, I'll turn over to Brett for additional detail on the financials. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the September quarter was $339.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our first quarter revenues by approximately $12.6 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 12%. Income from operations for the quarter was $80.5 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $71.3 million, an increase of 41% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, an increase of 48% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 61.4%, up sequentially from Q4 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing efficiencies and a lower Australian dollar. Moving forward, we expect our gross margin for fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 60% to 62%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $98.3 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.9% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2013. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.3 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 6%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8% compared to the year-ago figure of 8.3%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.6 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.9 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 22%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $194.4 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $145.4 million, consistent with the prior year. However, in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $84.8 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP devices. Masks and other sales were $109.6 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our mask product range and continued growth in accessories. For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $96.7 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $48.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 13%. Globally, in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 11%, while masks and other increased by 13%. Cash flow from operations was $78.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.7 million. Our share buyback continued to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 216,000 shares for consideration of 8.1 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for consideration of 391.2 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 8.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program, and during fiscal 2013, we intend to purchase at least 2 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $625 million. And at September 30, total assets stood at $2.2 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. I will now like to hand the call back to the operator to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just 1 question and a follow-up. I'm interested in regards to the round 1 and obviously the concerns of the competitive bidding. Yes, another quarter now. Have you seen any effects to the round 1 bidding process and certainly in terms of competitive behavior? Have you seen any changes from your competitors in terms of pricing behavior in the lead-up to the announcement, of course, of round 2?
Unknown Executive: Yes. I'll make 2 points on competitive bidding. We've had what I'll call a real-time pilot in the first 9 cities, the first 9 CMS calls and metropolitan statistical areas, 9 cities. We've had a number of quarters there. The 2 points are, firstly, that ASP declines in those 9 cities compared to the rest of the U.S. are in line. The second point is that growth for those 9 cities was in line with the rest of the market over the same period. Obviously, it was better with the winners than the non-winners within those cities, but it was awash overall. That's the message we gave 90 days ago, and, Matt, that hasn't changed in the last 90 days. It's still consistent with that.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. So just on that, did you see any change in -- or have you seen any change in competitive behavior around ASP outside of those 9 MSAs in the lead-up to the round 2 decision?
Unknown Executive: No. The behavior has been consistent both inside and outside, and it's consistent with what we have said, which is, depending on which SKU you look at, you generally got a 3% to 5% annualized reduction that can go slightly above that in some SKUs and slightly below that in some SKUs. That depends on the geography as we look at it, but it's sort of that mid single-digits number. And it hasn't changed significantly from -- within or outside the MSAs.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Excellent. Great. And, Peter, just back to you, just 1 follow-up question. You've often given us the industry growth rates and made comments around that before. Do you mind giving us your latest views on why you think the industry is growing at and whether you saw an uptick in the U.S. in the last quarter.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. No. We are not aware of any upticks, and we are -- most of the people, when you go to Medtrade and talk to various DMEs and HMEs and others, the 6% to 8% seems to be the figure, and that's -- so that's for the U.S. And our best guess, and obviously, it's much more complicated to get exact figures outside the U.S. because of the different geographies, but again, that looks to be consistent with the 6% to 8% growth. If you want a bit more of granularity, you might say, "Well, it could be more like 5% to 7% in Europe and maybe a little higher, 7% to 9%, 8% to 10% in Asia Pacific." But overall, ROW also fits the bill of a 6% to 8%.
Operator: The next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: First question for me just on the sales force for ventilation. How big do you think that will have to be?
Peter C. Farrell: We're going to start slowly, obviously, but I'm going to throw that one to Geoff Neilson, who's the President of Respiratory Care. But I think in the first year, we'll end up somewhere around 9 respiratory account managers, but Geoff, what are your plans? And then make them too vigorous, if you like.
Geoff Neilson: So we'll grow the respiratory care sales force, in line with growing revenue in respiratory care in the U.S. At the moment, that's obviously small, but we plan to grow it to having 1 respiratory care manager per region over time. And depending on how sales pick up, we'll grow it appropriately.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then one quick one for Brett. What was the net impact to currency on EPS? And any update on the medical device tax?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, David. For EPS impact on FX year-on-year was slightly negative but really less than $0.01 this quarter, so quite negligible. Medical devices tax, we still -- I think we're still waiting on the updated guidelines to come out. I mean, they're due out any time, but we think now they'll probably come out after the election. So really waiting to get some clarity from that before we give the market more clarity on it from how it's going to impact us.
Peter C. Farrell: Internally, David, we assume that it would not impact masks. Roughly, half the business would not be touched, and we also don't know about the devices. This -- again, we'll have to wait for the fine print, but we're even sort of contemplating that we may not even be stuck with the tax on the devices. But we don't know for sure yet.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So based on the mask growth that you put up in the U.S., it looked like it may have slowed down a tad, but I was just wondering if you -- now that we're more than a quarter into this change to Medicare's resupply policy, if you think that had any impact on your mask growth at all.
Peter C. Farrell: It is early days, but we are seeing no impact whatsoever. Now we think the reason for that is that most people have been playing ball. I mean, I don't think that this CMS directive had much impact at all. I'll get -- make the comment on it, but it's -- if you look at the average, CMS will pay for 4 systems a year, and, in fact, the average is under 2. So we see it as a potential -- a significant potential area for growth. But Mick, do you want to comment?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Mike, I'd make 3 points on this area about CMS documentation. The first point is this is just Medicare. So it's 25% of the U.S. market, which is about 10% to 12% of the global market or under 12% of the global market. Number two, they made changes to documentation but no changes to frequency or the reimbursement rates. So it's just changes to the documentation. And number three, that those changes to documentation, after some further clarification, which took 2 or 3 months because it's the government after that clarification came out, customers were pretty quick to change their systems, whether it's an IVR where you press 1 to say that the system is dysfunctional or it's a call script that requires that question and documents it or it's a formal written sign-off process where the patient signs off on nonfunctional use. So those 3 things, I think, have played out and sort of minimized effect, if any, really, of this in terms of -- over the long term.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: All right. And then my second question is on a new technology. I've been at TCT this week, and there's a lot of excitement around renal denervation. And obviously, it's targeting hypertension initially, but there's talk of a lot of other potential indications, including OSA and complex sleep apnea -- or sorry, central sleep apnea. So I'm just wondering if you had taken a look at this therapy and whether or not it's something that you would view as a potential threat to CPAP therapy down the road. Admittedly, this is years off, years off and years off in the future before it would potentially even be approved, but...
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. No. It's hard for me to envision -- or first, let me make the point but JNC7, the Joint National Commission on the diagnosis, management and treatment of hypertension, has suggested or made the statement that the #1 cause out of 9 identifiable factors for hypertension is untreated sleep-disordered breathing, of which, obviously, obstructive sleep apnea is the main manifestation. Now the renal nerve innovation or the use of the barbecuing of the artery, it's hard to see how that connects. It appears to work in drug-resistant hypertension, and we know that 83% -- well into the 80s of drug-resistant hypertension patients do have sleep-disordered breathing. But if you have sleep-disordered breathing and your hypertension is ameliorated by the renal denervation, then you still need to have the sleep-disordered breathing treated because it doesn't stop the other -- the sympathetic neural activity that's associated with the catecholamines. So I just found this such a long bow. I can't even imagine that this would be a treatment for any form of sleep-disordered breathing. And if it were, it would only be in the central area. Because looking at what sleep-disordered breathing is, it's really a mechanical issue, and it's due to the -- as your diaphragm moves, you create negative pressure, the air flows into the lungs and, of course, that causes a negative pressure in the upper airways. So if you have a floppy upper airway and wherever it may be in the pharynx, the velo, hypo, oropharynx, it's a mechanical issue. So I think it's a very, very long bow. Now maybe, maybe there are some impact on central sleep apnea, but it's -- you'd -- I'd like to see a hell of a lot of compelling data to show that it would impact it. But obviously, with central sleep apnea, we have an open airway. It's not the same -- it's not a mechanical issue, it's a neurologic issue. And because it's neurologic, it's -- you could say, "Well, okay, maybe it's -- it could be impacted by anything that -- it appears with the neuro system." But I'd like to see some compelling data before we're sold on it.
Operator: The next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: My first question is on manufacturing. Just wondering how sort of far through you are, your migration to Singapore, how much more capacity there is to ship production there.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, we -- currently, it's roughly for masks, interfaces and devices. It's roughly 54% of our total production. Given how easy it is to work with the Singaporean government as opposed to more socialist governments, we will be probably moving more manufacturing into Singapore. It's got an extraordinarily favorable tax rate, and you can sit down with the Singaporean government. And when they talk about academic business and governments working together, it's one of the weirdest things in the world, they actually mean it. So you actually sit down with people that actually want to help you and not hinder you with more regulations and more workplace relation issues and so forth. Australia, frankly, is a nightmare of industrial relations. But having said that, we will be continuing to invest in Singapore for ease of doing business, meaning regulations and working relationships and an extraordinarily favorable tax rate, which is well under 10%. So if I had to guess, we'll just keep expanding in Singapore, and I wouldn't be surprised, that this is -- I haven't looked at the actual numbers, but I wouldn't be surprised if we are more like 75% this year. But Rob, do you want to make a comment on that since you are closer?
Robert Douglas: Yes, Ian, we're really happy with the way Singapore is going. And so the long-term plan was then progressively increasing capacity and putting production up there. We've been really happy with the capacity that's there off a pretty small footprint, and we see a lot more efficiency guidance. So that trend will keep going. We're not going to jump off and [indiscernible]. We'll be progressive always as things move up. We're also pretty happy with our Malaysian factory, which is up and running, doing headgear. And down the track, we might see more options in that area as well.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: My second question, just looking at pricing and price declines, one thing, the payback from the industry is pretty consistent that over the last 5 years, most of the price declines have been seen in low-end Flow Gens, whereas mask pricing has been relatively stable. Just wondering firstly if that's true. And secondly, have you seen any changes to that sort of in recent times?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Ian, pricing is something that you deal with every day. And as far as pricing pressures go, I think we've been fairly consistent. We've expected somewhere around the 4% to 5% annual decrease in prices, and obviously, we need to keep ahead of the curve. And with manufacturing efficiencies, we've been able to do that. We don't see the terrain. Look, it's challenging. And the irony of this market is that most of the pricing pressure is actually driven by competitors as opposed to the customers, and it's just one of those weird markets where as you can see from our numbers, given the growth rates being around 6% to 8% and our growth rates in constant currency being around 12%. But if you look at the net income, the revenues, I mean, obviously, that's a reflection of a number of things. But improvements in the valuable growth improvements with the S9 platform and, obviously, the movement from basic CPAP to APAP, pretty encouraging. But I'll throw that question, I mean, make Don -- maybe Don Darkin can talk about masks, and you can talk about devices or -- but there's nothing scary that we're seeing. That's just the way of the world. People want to buy...
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, I wasn't suggesting any scare. I just [indiscernible] was there any differential in the price declines between masks and Flow Gens.
Michael J. Farrell: Don, do you want to go first?
Donald Darkin: Yes, I don't -- Ian, I don't think there's anything that's headline with our expectations, and quite frankly, we're tracking pretty much as we expected across this year's fiscal. So there's no real difference at all in -- not from what we're seeing.
Michael J. Farrell: I mean, all I'd add is that the conversation with customers and really payers in this space is starting to turn from a discussion around price to one about value. We're moving away from just a discussion around utilization management, which is, can you do competitive bidding and move from x to point 9x on a unit price to are you saving money for my health care system by keeping these patients out of hospital? So the discussions are moving to a higher level, and we're having them with customers and with their customers' payer groups to change that conversation from more utilization management, which focuses on price, to one on care management, which focuses on sort of the return on investment that a payer gets by putting a high-value patient on the VPAP Adapt and keeping them out of the ICU and CCU and similarly for an LSA patient on CPAP or even better on AutoSet. So that's sort of where the discussions are going in, but no big differential to your question between masks and Flow Gens on that pressure.
Peter C. Farrell: But having said that, and I agree, but moving from utilization management to care management is a lot easier to say than do. And there's a lot of work that we have to put in. We're putting a lot of time and effort into healthy economics by gathering data, showing people what -- in fact, this is -- as we said in the press release, it is the holy grail. I mean, we've given up collecting testimonials on the quality of life because it's just real. I mean, it's there. And so it's not something we're surprised at. The second thing is we're seeing more and more data on savings of inpatient and outpatient costs, particularly with these readmission rates. I mean, it is going to become standard of care because, simply, if -- unless you treat the sleep-disordered breathing, if you have 25% to 30% of the adult population with sleep-disordered breathing at some level, I should stress. That's an AHI greater than 5. Do they all need treatment? Well, they do if they've got a co-morbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, reflux nocturnal and depression and on and on. But we are seeing this moving very favorably. And the third thing is what we're seeing and a lot more encouragingly is that we're seeing not only is the disease process in these co-morbidities being slowed, it's actually in some cases being reversed. So if you've got quality of care on your side, you've got reduced cost on your side and you've got reduced disease progression. All this translates into a very favorable environment going forward. Now there will be challenges, but we're very comfortable in the space we're in.
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So I've got a couple of questions for you, please. The -- can you break out for us what's going on with the international generator business? How big a chunk is Stellar today and what the growth rates are in underlying blowers for CPAP within that broader number?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, as you know, we don't get very granular, Ben, but I will say that the Stellar 100 and the Stellar 150 is selling extraordinarily well. And if you look at percentages of devices, it's a higher percentage -- a much higher percentage -- well, considerably higher percentage ROW compared to the U.S. But with the push into institutional sales, it's going to be built up gradually. And we're -- as I said in my remarks, we're targeting the Stellar for NIV, noninvasive ventilation institutional sales, and the homecare would be the VPAP ST-A with iVAPS. The reimbursement favors that kind of push. But do you want to add any more, Geoff or Mick?
Geoff Neilson: No. I think you said it all.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So just to finish that point of Peter, the growth rate of underlying international CPAP blowers is consistent with the total for that segment, if nothing else?
Peter C. Farrell: The growth rate ROW is less with the blowers, for sure. It's, in terms of granularity, hard to know, but it's a little -- as I said before, it's a little less in Europe and a little higher in Asia Pac. But it comes out -- Ben, it comes out at about the same. We think the market's growing at about 6% to 8%. It's a little lighter in Europe and a little higher in Asia Pac.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then just my second question, if I may. Thinking about gross margin and the move into -- the further move into Singapore, as well as the mix. As you go through the next couple of quarters, Peter, you start to annualize the launch of the S9 bilevel. I think that's in the June quarter, so your comps will get a little bit tougher. Are you confident you can continue to see a strong generator growth kind of in the middle to back half of next year on generators with that dynamic? And then second, can you continue to see gross margin trending up with currency staying stable?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, our best guess, as Brett said, is that the gross margin will remain in the 60% to 62% range. We're seeing -- it's -- we considerably hope, Ben, as you would obviously know, the change with the HST to AutoSet. That's extremely helpful. The price pressures are greater at the low-end CPAP, but the growth is much lower there and there's the switch with the requirements of pre-authorization, et cetera. So I think we see that area. I mean, this is just me talking now. But I think this time next year, we're going to see -- of all the tests, I think it's going to be closer to 50%, it could even be higher, depending upon how aggressive the payers are with the PSG authorization area. It could even be -- I might have to go crazy, it could be 75%, but I mean, that's just sort of in the lap of the gods. But...
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. But the point [indiscernible].
Peter C. Farrell: So we don't -- strong price -- I don't see -- we don't see any -- sorry, what's that?
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I was just saying that even in the face of more difficult comparisons on bilevel as you annualize the launch of the CPAP, auto -- the auto PAP trends remain strong.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, they do. And we're actually very optimistic with the Stellar products. I mean, they are -- the Stellar 150 with iVAPS is being extraordinarily well-received. Do you want to say a word about that -- or Brett, do you want to comment? And maybe Geoff after Brett.
Brett A. Sandercock: Just on them, I mean, we have -- the product mix has been favorable for us, and we've got, I mean, the CPAP to APAP Chief there. Obviously, the bilevel is coming to the S9 box, and they've done particularly well. So those factors are there. And if you're going to be realistic there, it's quite a nice uptick from that. I do think that mix will still be favorable for us going forward, Ben, but maybe not to the extent that we've seen. But I still think we'll see some favorable mix coming through, which will help us.
Peter C. Farrell: And Geoff, do you want to say...
Geoff Neilson: So all I would add is that with iVAPS being very well-received globally, particularly in Japan more recently, I know that we've got iVAPS on the S9 platform. Obviously, that's going to give us a very good margin product, and we expect to see that growing quickly over the coming quarters.
Peter C. Farrell: I guess in short, Ben, we're cautiously optimistic that we can stay ahead of the curve.
Operator: The next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just a question on rest of world. I was very impressed with your rest of world constant currency growth. And, in particular, I listened to the comments last quarter about Japan being a bit lumpy and had been a good quarter. It would seem that it's happened again in this quarter. Just wondering if you think we should think about Japan as being something about a step-up that will continue on for the rest of this -- at least the rest of this year.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, David, the one thing that I noted in the comments was that as opposed to reimbursement cuts, which everybody expects, this was, in fact, a reimbursement uptick. And also, there's very favorable environment for cardiologists to adapt -- or take on adaptive servo-ventilation, and we are actually planning on taking some physicians [indiscernible] heart failure, one particularly influential heart failure expert from the U.S. to Japan to talk to some of the cardiologists there, the heart failure cardiologists, to see if we can leverage some of their results. And I mean, it's a critical mass of cardiologists in Japan who are now have -- doing not only adaptive servo-ventilation, they're not involving sleep physicians at all, they're just doing it themselves. So we -- yes, we -- I think we need a little bit more information, a little bit more data. I mean, we're anxious to see what we can sort of -- what lessons we can learn and then apply to other markets, in particular, the U.S., which, of course, is our, by far, in a way, our biggest market. But I would say, yes, we are pretty encouraged about Japan and not just with adaptive servo-ventilation but also with Stellar, with Teijin. And Geoff knows that he needs to improve his numbers. But with Teijin and Fukuda Denshi, both of our Japanese distributors are really impressed with the Stellar product.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And obviously, I'm very happy with the number there, Peter.
Peter C. Farrell: Oh, okay. Good. But they need to be...
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Would it be fair to say that the growth that we've seen in Asia Pac you've mentioned is a bit stronger than Europe? Is Japan a very important part of that stronger growth?
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. Yes. But also India and China. So India -- obviously, the base is -- the growth rates are bigger in India or in China, but the base is smaller. But we are very optimistic about India -- about both India and China and Japan. We've been in there for 15-or-so years. I mean, that's always been a good market, and we don't see that changing.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just wanted to ask another question focusing on U.S. mask business. Certainly, we've seen trend towards much stronger growth in masks, driven by these replenishment programs. I know you've talked about a market growth of 6% to 8%. So presumably, as we move through the process, we're going to see market growth come back towards that market growth rate. I'm just wondering where you think we're up to in that trend?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, it's a difficult mix, David, and I'll throw the question to Don. But -- and just to make a comment. As you put more and more patients onto treatment, you've got this growing replenishment opportunity. And if you look at our business, the -- that is an extraordinarily fast-growing area, and there's a lot of potential to go from just under 2 masks per patient per year to 3 to 4. So there's a lot of potential there if the patient does, in fact, need a new mask. And so we think that it's a pretty attractive space, actually. And so I don't see anytime soon the growth rates coming back to the 6% to 8% in the masks space. But Don, what are your feelings? And maybe Mick can chime in as well.
Donald Darkin: Yes. Similarly, I agree with you, Peter. We don't see that coming off anytime soon. I think with the growth in the segments and the strength we have in those channels, it's going to be around those numbers. We're seeing a mild dip in numbers along with our expectations due to the new masks that have been launched this period. It's pretty much in line with what we think, and we'll probably be back over the next period as people start to look at the relative merits of those new masks. But as far as this space is concerned, it still remains very healthy.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, and, I mean, to Don's point, if competitors are launching new products, people are going to try it. But it takes a while for the water to flow under the bridge, and we've done our own comparisons. We feel comfortable, very comfortable, I should say, with our products. But other people have got to [indiscernible], and -- but we're confident that we have a little bit of air between us and the other guys. But...
Michael J. Farrell: David, all I'd add is that there is runway left on replenishment. We can get more movement there, but in addition to that, compliance systems and the focus on adherence is becoming a greater and greater focus for our HME customers and their customers, the payer. And as they look more at that, they have more systematized approaches to it. We launched the product, EasyCare Online, which was a major global initiative that the team was able to bring to the market. And now the data, as to whether you're using your device or not, is taken to the physician, the payer and the patient from the cloud. And that visibility to compliance rates allows customers to better treat their patients and health care systems to better keep their patients out of hospitals. So that focus on adherence should provide some long-term runway to growth of replenishment revenues like masks and other accessories, tubing, filters and even repair, because every 5 years or so, you should replace the device as well.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Mick, in terms of replenishment, do you think the majority of your DME customers have gone on to that and have become a serious [indiscernible] to their business or we're still seeing maybe a tier of DMEs that you're doing?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, David, I would say a majority of the large nationals have moved, although there's still some further improvements that they can make to their systems. But the next tier down is the large regionals has a lot more room for improvement on that front. And frankly, at the moment, PAP level, the local regionals, there is still, sadly, a large segment where the focus on long-term compliance and adherence and replenishment is not even part of the conversation. It's part of the conversation we have with them but not necessarily something they're implementing yet. So the answer to that is there's at least -- of the 3 tiers, there's 2 tiers where we've got considerable room for improvement.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just going to rattle off a few here just to get a better sense of gross margin potential and mix. And I know you haven't given this out in the past, but on the generator side, would you care to share the mix of CPAP autos and bilevels, sort of where that is today and potentially where that can go? And then one on the distributor side. Can you give a sense of how many in the U.S., how may distributors you're dealing with today? And has that consolidated to any extent with competitive bidding?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Anthony, firstly, it'd be a first if we started to share granularity on -- we've said that the APAP is growing very fast compared to the fixed pressure CPAPs. But we just -- first of all, competitors would love to know it. And so we don't share that information about product mix. I'm not going to go any further than that. And your second question, what was that again?
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: With regard to distributor consolidation.
Peter C. Farrell: I'll throw that to Mick. But there is a little bit, if you want to address it.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, I mean, the answer, Anthony, is that we're not going to -- obviously, going to the, again, the granularity of the number of customers we have now and had 12 months ago, but we will give the general trend that there is industry consolidation at the HME level. You've seen the public announcements of Linde buying LinCare. You've seen the public announcements of Apria buying the assets of Praxair, and there are other acquisitions that have happened, obviously. But in terms of this industry, it's got a large degree of fragmentation. This consolidation has gone on and will continue to go on, and it's probably cataloged a little by competitive bidding. But we have good relationships with the large nationals, and we have good relationships with the regionals. And we expect those to continue on throughout that consolidation. But it's a trend that's been there, and we expect to continue at its same rate but not to change dramatically.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: One quick one, if I may. The high-class problem here, $890 million in cash, and I know about a year ago or a little bit more than that now, there was an effort to sort of look at things outside strategically. I'm just wondering if we can get an update there.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, well, we've spent -- if you look at 2012 and 2013, just the first quarter, we spent close to $400 million just simply doing share buyback, and that's one use of the capital there. But you're right, I mean, $890 million, even if you take out the total amount of debt, it still leaves us, give or take a bit, with $600 million. So we have dry powder, and we are continually scanning the horizon. And basically, we are looking -- we're not going to get into movie-making or sailboat-making or anything like that. We're in the sleep business, and that's where we're -- sleep and respiratory care business, and that's where we're staying, obviously. But you saw the purchase of BiancaMed. We're absolutely delighted with that. We're also delighted with the 12.5% tax rate, and then we're also delighted with the fact that the Irish government, like the Singaporean government, want to sit down and talk to you. And you get academics and the business guys and the government guys all in one room and they really do want to help you, and we get some help there with the R&D. But we are continually looking at -- as you know, we've got a ResMed Ventures and Initiatives group, which is headed up by Jim Hollingshead. And virtually, every day, there's something that comes across Jim's desk, and we take a look at it. So I guess what we're looking at is new technologies that dovetail into the respiratory or sleep business. We're also looking at people that are out there that we can take -- oh, as Connie just shoved down to my nose, of course, we did buy Grundler in the humidification space. I mean, I hadn't forgotten that, Connie, but thanks. And also [indiscernible], of course, with the compliance where we're now able to get compliance measurements. It's not just for our products but also for competitive products. And we are making a push, obviously, in the area of dental sleep medicine. We've just got FDA approval, working through the reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, Kristie Burns. And that's also in Jim Hollingshead's group, we're making a big push on dental sleep within the U.S. environment. And we're kind of encouraged by the strides we are making there. But yes, there's no question we have plenty of dry powder, but we are also looking carefully of what's around. But when you look at where to invest, we're looking for things that potentially can grow 20% top and bottom line. And, I mean, there's just not that many opportunities. But if you come across something, Anthony, give us a hoy.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Hurren from UBS.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I understand you don't want to break out products, but previously, we've discussed publicly the loss of market share in the bilevels and servo-ventilators and those sort of things and where you think you are today following launch. Has that market share come back or has that been rebuilt, you just were doing organic growth now?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I think if you look at the growth figures, if you step back strategically and you look at our market growing at 6% to 8% globally and then you look at our numbers 40%, 41% up at the bottom line on net income and net income of 21% to revenues and you look at the gross margin of 61.4%, that clearly reflects a higher value products growing very well. And that, obviously, is adaptive servo-ventilators. So we are really doing extremely well in getting back lost business in the adaptive servo-ventilation area, and we're also seeing nice growth now that every -- the bilevels are in the S9 platform. You can argue we should have done it sooner, maybe we should have, but clearly, the numbers are reflective of the fact that we are, if you like, back on deck.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just another question. You talked before about the potential for home sleep testing to become a very big part of the market, in short, become aggressive with this pre-authorization. Do you see any risk in there? And what are you seeing on the ground during this changeover period? I guess I'm just curious to see if there's any patients falling in between the cracks as 1 system transitions to another.
Peter C. Farrell: It's very -- it's such early days, what works. But will the primary care physicians adopt it in the way we like to see them? They likely will use independent testing facilities, the IDTFs, or the sleep labs going to go out and start marketing to the PCPs and say, "Hey, look, don't worry about it. We're going to offer you both PSG, even though it's pre-authorization. We should be able to get that, but we'll also offer you HST." We think the smart sleep labs are offering both. Obviously, they want more patients going through PSG because they make more money, but it's a very complex mix. But I -- if I had to guess, I'd say that we're going to see a certain number of PCPs as they get comfortable with HST because they take it up themselves and go straight to AutoSet, that's the easiest thing to do. You don't have the option of going to a lab to have the pressure set. It has to be automatic. The good news is that there are several papers out showing that, in fact, ironically, that if you go HST to APAP, you in fact get average along with those paper by Rosanne [indiscernible] and Susan Redline at Harvard. But this was multiple groups. I think it was 7 or 8 sleep centers across the country, and they show, in fact, almost an hour or more per night usage on the average and compliance that was around 12% up. So, in fact, rather than the sleep labs, they used to say that it was really unprofessional and bad medicine, and what we're finding is that if you do use HST, it's so much easier for the patient, it's so much cheaper, so much more convenient. And APAP works just as well as we've known that for over a decade, works just as well, the 6 APAP set in the lab. In fact, the data is showing, if anything, it's at least as good and, in some cases, even better. So this is not a complicated area, and I think we're going to see far more involvement of PCPs but also in addition, specialists, like cardiologists and endocrinologists, perhaps. If you're doing HST, you couldn't think of anything simpler, and the treatment itself is safer than an aspirin. So it's almost no downside. So complex area, very early days, but we see continuing good growth in the space and more and more non-sleep-trained physicians implementing the therapy and sending all the tough ones to the sleep physicians. Stuff they can't work out, they'll send back to the sleep lab.
Michael J. Farrell: Dan, what I'll add to that is you've got -- your question was about risks as you move from PSG to HST. We've got risk mitigation in that we have 3 models that are being trialed out in the ecosystem there. There's IDTFs and there's PCP direct, but there's also sleep labs conducting home sleep testing. And you heard in the remarks early that 40% this quarter, 40% of sleep labs are now offering home sleep testing as an alternative, and we think that offering that choice is actually good for the patient and can reduce what we call leakage through the value chain. So we're mitigating the risk by looking at 3 models. And the market is choosing and the patients are choosing, and the sleep labs are helping facilitate patients to get their choice. And we think that's a good thing for patients, for the payers and for the long term of our industry. So there's more money available to keep the patients on therapy compliant and out of hospital.
Peter C. Farrell: Couldn't have said it better.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So I think you're saying that there is sufficient home sleep testing capacity there now as the sort of insurers push hard?
Michael J. Farrell: There's actually scalable models being set up so that as patients come to these new modalities, they can scale with the patients that they come through. So the answer is capacity is there and capacity is available to grow through multiple methods. So in short, Dan, yes.
Peter C. Farrell: Thank you. I think we're probably good to close here, Christine.
Operator: Yes, we are at the 1-hour mark. Please go ahead with any final remarks.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I will. First off all, for those of you still on the call, thank you for joining us. But more importantly, I would like to thank all our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued exemplary performance. We are delighted with your commitment and loyalty and efforts. And so we all here around the table, thank you very much. And that's it. That's [indiscernible].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] The company has asked me to address certain matters: First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.
Peter C. Farrell: Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining. I'll begin as usual with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock for some more granularity on the finances. And we will then do some Q&A. First, the financial summary. We finished with another extremely solid quarter and fiscal year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $372 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $207 million. And ROW revenues increased by 3% or 13% in constant currency terms to $165 million. This represents our 70th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line since we went public. I don't believe there are too many companies in that category that can boast a record like that. But we'll get some more granularity on that for those who are interested. For fiscal 2012, we reported revenues of approximately $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year and earnings per share of $1.71, up 19% year-over-year. We believe that superior product quality continues to drive our growth. Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $77 million, while GAAP EPS increased a robust 43% to a record $0.53 for this quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54. With respect to product performance, let me start with masks. All mask categories showed strong growth. And we continue to take market share, particularly with the Mirage nasal mask, which is thus far proving to be a seeming game changer. Accessories also grew strongly, as both large and small HMEs and DMEs are becoming more systematic about resupply and delivery of replenishment supplies to the patients who need them. Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by the high-end devices. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having all of our PAP devices configured on the smaller, quieter and more appealing S9 platform. In the Americas the S9 AutoSet and the VPAP Adapt, which is an adaptive servo-ventilator did particularly well. Growth in the Flow Generator segment was also driven by a positive mix shift from basic CPAP to APAP due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing, as well as, we believe, physician preference to put patients on the AutoSet, which provides more flexible therapy, improves patient comfort and appears to enhance compliance. The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be well received, and we expect to see some solid ongoing uptake from existing, as well as new accounts. Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance are what bring the most value to the patients, customers and service providers. In other words, across the whole food chain. Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment, although sales were relatively strong in both Germany and the U.K. Despite this challenging economic climate, bilevel, AutoSets CS, which is also our version of the adaptive servo-ventilator in the rest of the world, and the Stellar products all did well in this quarter. We also believe that great opportunities exist in Europe to address the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and various comorbidities, such as heart disease, diabetes and so on, as well as occupational health and the more compelling economic case and the more -- and the more and more compelling economic case for treating sleep apnea in general. There's also a great deal more focus on compliance, which certainly positions us well with our high-quality products. The Asia Pacific region also had a solid quarter, particularly in the Japanese market, due to strong sales in sleep, as well as our bilevel and respiratory product portfolio, which also did very well. Of interest, cardiologists are adopting adaptive servo-ventilation, with some bigger in Japan. In fact, some cardiologists are actually using ASV even in patients without frank sleep-disordered breathing. And as they have noted, an improvement in various chronic heart failure parameters, particularly ejection fraction. Emerging markets like India, China and the Middle East also did very well this quarter. Ventilation sales of Stellar 100 and 150 continue to grow, especially in Europe, Latin America and Asia and again, more particularly in Japan. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS, which is a new automatic bilevel mode. iVAPS is also included in the new S9-based VPAP ST and the ST-A products. These are launching this quarter. VPAP ST-A with iVAPS has FDA clearance for respiratory insufficiency. The launch of this product on the S9 platform is significant, as we have actually skipped a generation in this segment in going from the S9 platform, which is a lot more bulky to the much smaller S9 platform. On the home sleep testing front, commercial payers continue to introduce the requirement of pre-authorization for intended PSG sleep test. United joined the club in July. And as a result, by the end of summer, 2/3 -- more than 2/3 of covered lives will need pre-authorization to polysomnography. We estimate that in -- we estimated that in 2011, about 50% of all sleep tests were HST, and we expect to see at least 25% of all sleep tests being HST-derived by the end of this calendar year. And we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, which is up to close to 30%. We're also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance, with PCPs becoming more involved and interested in sleep apnea diagnosis. A few weeks ago, we acquired an innovative data services technology provider, known as Umbian, headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Umbian offers a comprehensive patient compliance management solution called U-Sleep, which monitors CPAP devices and provides a suite of interactive follow-up services for health care providers. For HME providers, usually there's an effective tool to reduce cost and improve business efficiency. U-Sleep supports CPAP devices from the leading CPAP manufacturers so that usage data can be consolidated and viewed from one software platform. This technology is able to assess a patient's compliance using a flexible set of rules that have been set up for that specific individual and provide immediate notification of compliance outcomes via e-mail, phone or if the provider prefers, text messages. U-Sleep's simple yet powerful design also provides multiple reporting options tied to the varying needs of HME providers. One of the biggest issues facing HMEs is competitive bidding and concomitant pricing pressures. By providing a scalable solution for compliance outreach, we are taking a significant step in supporting our HME partners to drive efficiencies and cost reduction in their businesses. Customers use products from a range of manufacturers. And this is one of the strengths of the U-Sleep platform. U-Sleep will continue to transfer compliance data from therapy devices manufactured by other companies. On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize. Just to summarize a few of the newest findings. Sleep disorders are associated with the following: One, a higher risk of dying from cancer with the risk correlated with the severity of the disease; diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a debilitating disease, which causes severe pain in the hands and feet; three, frequent co-morbidity with polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder which affects up to 10% of women of childbearing age; four, poor prognosis in chronic heart failure. But with the treatment of the sleep-disordered breathing with nocturnal ventilation the outcomes are significantly improved. Let's see, six, untreated central sleep apnea and heart failure readmission to hospital. This is particularly significant since it turned out that central sleep apnea was by far and away the most significant parameter, which was involved with the readmission of patients with chronic heart failure to the hospital. This suggests a wonderful opportunity for our adaptive servo-ventilator products. And finally, there's double the risk -- if the patient has sleep-disordered breathing, there is double the risk of retinal vein occlusion. In summary, this suggests that sleep-disordered breathing is involved with a multitude of diseases, and treatment of the disorder really ought to be part of any standard of care, just like one would take blood pressure. Finally, a study has just been published in Population Health Management on the cost savings associated with an education campaign on the diagnosis and management of sleep-disordered breathing. The primary objective was to determine if medical expenses of members enrolled in the not-for-profit U.S.-based Union Pacific Railroad Employes Health Systems health plan were reduced after implementing a low-cost, patient-focused education program on sleep-disordered breathing. Based on the retrospective analysis of medical claims data, the campaign was associated with a 145% increase in the uptake of PAP therapy by members with sleep-disordered breathing. And within 2 years after initiating the program, the use of PAP therapy was associated with almost $5 million in differential savings and overall medical costs, lower inpatient hospital costs and fewer hospital admissions than those members with sleep-disordered breathing who did not receive therapy. These findings suggest that the sleep-disordered breathing education campaign can improve health care outcomes and result in substantial savings through for the health care plan. All of the peer-reviewed literature continues to make it abundantly clear that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is at best seriously debilitating and costly to the health care system and at worst life threatening. These findings add to the continuing mounting evidence connecting serious health disorders to untreated sleep-disordered breathing and point to the necessity of making the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, as I've just said, a standard of care in all medical practice. Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide more granularity on the financials, and then we'll take your questions. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: All right. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the June quarter was $371.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our fourth quarter revenues by approximately $14.6 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Income from operations for the quarter was $89.7 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.8 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53, an increase of 43% over the prior year quarter. Gross margins for the June quarter was 60.9%, up sequentially from Q3 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin continued to benefit from a favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 61%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $105.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved 28.5% compared to the year ago figure of 29.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 29% for the fiscal year 2013. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 10%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.9 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $8.1 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.3%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 23.2%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 22%. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $207.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $90.2 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP devices. Masks and other sales were $117.2 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our mask product range and continued growth in accessories. Revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $110.8 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Masks and other sales were $53.7 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%. Globally, in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 10%, while masks and other increased by 16%. Cash flow from operations was $97 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $22.4 million. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2012 was a record $383.2 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for consideration of 89 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for consideration of 391.2 million. The 38.6 million shares purchased in fiscal year 2012 represents approximately 9.3% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of June, we had approximately 8.8 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. And in addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. We ended the fiscal year financially and operationally in excellent shape. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $559 million. And at June 30, total assets stood at $2.1 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. I will now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just wanted to -- actually, first question just you mentioned a new product being added to the S9 range. I miss some of the details there. Could you just fly through that?
Peter C. Farrell: Those are Dan -- well the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A are bilevel units are now in the S9 platform. So initially, we did the CPAPs. But now we're putting all products, including the adaptive servo-ventilator into the S9 platform. So it's much more appealing, it's smaller, it's quieter and we're pretty excited now that we've got everything. And we're just launching the ST and the ST-A this quarter.
Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Understood. Look, just one of the other big issue that's obviously been going around, there's been a lot of discussion about competitive bidding, the impact on the company. Some of the discussion around the industry is that ResMed, in fact -- ResMed are looking to partner with some of the HMEs. There might actually be some volume offsets here. Could you sort of give us a bit of a run-through on what you think the competitive bidding impact is?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, let me just make a few comments, and I'll turn it to Mick for some further comment. The competitive bidding, if you look at our business, the impact is total revenues, the exposure is about 10% of the revenues. So I'll call it $140 million. But the interesting thing, as I've said in a previous earnings call, we have no significant impact on ASPs. And bear in mind, this is all and I guess stating the obvious, it's all CMS. And so the private payers have already dealt with this on ASPs. And if you like, they're ahead of CMS. But we don't see it as a significant factor at all. And I think you, in fact, Dan, have actually written about this. So private payers are not impacted. It's only CMS. And we're continuing to support our customers through a variety of resources to enable them to incorporate the latest Medicare requirements. But it's -- we don't -- it's just not -- it seems to spook people out in the marketplace, for some reason, the analysts in particular. But it doesn't spook us. And I don't know whether -- Mick, do you want to add anything to that?
Michael J. Farrell: No, I just confirm 3 points on competitive bidding. Number one, as you noted, it's 20% to 25% of our U.S. business, but that's 10% to 12% of our global business. Number two, in the first 9 cities, we're in a real-time experiment here. We're in month 14 of that, and we haven't seen a material impact on us. In fact, we've maintained or grown share with the customers who were the winners. And that the winners, third point, have scale. They are large companies that we either have electronic data interchange or some ways of finding efficiencies in the system. So that would take cost out of the system of delivering to patients. So they're the 3 points I'll make on that, Dan?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.
Jacob Messina: It's Jacob Messina in for Joanne. Just quickly wanted to ask a little bit about -- more about Umbian, if you could. The U-Sleep, How it fits with EasyCare, how it fits with the franchise, how it will be marketed, that kind of thing.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I'm going to flip that question to Don Darkin, who is President of the Strategic Business Unit for Sleep. Because Don is the guy who negotiated the purchase and the earner. So, Don, over to you to make a comment?
Donald Darkin: Thanks. So what we're doing here is pulling in a compliance software package, which actually is sort of adjunct to the EasyCare online solution that we've just launched. So what we're seeing here is that with that program and the program we just launched, it will become a much easier solution for HMEs and providers where we intend to take costs out and allow these guys to focus on their business, while this program will manage the compliance end of the patient.
Jacob Messina: Okay, great. And should we assume that the revenue impact is immaterial and dilution is immaterial as well?
Donald Darkin: At this case -- at this time, yes, absolutely. It's immaterial to us.
Peter C. Farrell: The maximum would be $0.01 a share and it probably won't even get to that. And a year out, it will be accretive.
Jacob Messina: And then maybe just quickly on the med tech tax. If you had any further update on how it will impact you all? And how you might handle it?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, there hasn't been any greater clarification in that space. And as far as we're concerned, we're making the assumption that it may well impact -- we're not sure about this, but it might impact the dental appliance area, the Narval products. But they're almost an immaterial part of our business at this point. So therefore, it doesn't affect current numbers at all. And maybe some of the hospital-based products, Stellar 100, 150 perhaps might accrue, but we're talking, 2.3%. But again, it's not really a material amount. Now if it affects all the products, you can do the math there. That is 2.3%. But there's a lot more water that's going to flow onto the bridge in this space. And we're not, at this point -- we're more concerned about Obamacare, which is a shambles in our view than the tax itself and maybe it won't even be implemented with a bit of luck.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So just to clarify what you said on the medical device tax there. So that's not in the guidance for SG&A that was given earlier in the call, correct?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. Michael, it's Brett here. Yes, that's correct. I mean, it's still -- as Peter said, it's just too uncertain for us to know what -- which within our portfolio what products are in or out. We certainly think we'll get a clearer view of that when the final regulations come out. I think we expect them sometime in September. But there's even -- I mean, even within the industry and peers and so on, there's even conjecture about where does the medical device tax sit, does it sit in COGS, SG&A, where is it going to sit. So even that's not perfectly clear right now. But I think as we get to September, we'll get the final regulations. I think we'll certainly have some more clarity around that for you.
Peter C. Farrell: But Michael, we are reasonably sure, at least our internal tax guy has checked with a lot of sources. We think it's -- and again, we need clarification, as Brett said, but we think it's -- the impact is going to be fairly minimal for us that is.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: And that's -- is that because the products are essentially considered to be sold at retail to patients? Or...
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. We think of it -- it does impact, as I said, the dental end of our business, which of course is not material at this point. We're planning on making it material, of course and also any hospital-based products. That's as far as we're reading the 2 at least. And we're fairly comfortable with that.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay, all right. So just moving on. I mean, you got the question on competitive bidding, but I guess the other Medicare change is this the resupply policy where the HMEs now have to sort of somehow verify that the equipment is no longer functioning before they can replace it, I guess, for masks and tubing and things like that. So what is your expectation of the impact, if any, that, that will have on your mask and accessories business?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I think it's a sensible approach by the government. I mean, it's -- if people aren't using it, you shouldn't be sending masks out. So I think that most people are just -- it's going to make them become more systematic and make sure that the patient needs it. But frankly, we think this is really a storm in a teacup. We are seeing less than 2 masks a year being used per device as it stands and the -- and CMS allows 4. So we're not even pushing the side. It's not a boundary condition for us. So I would say it's not something that we're the least bit concerned about. And I think it's tightening up the system and I think it's sensible that this is being done. But, Mick, do you want to make a comment?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Michael, it's Mick here. I would just add 2 points that firstly, this is just an opportunity for us to support our customers. It's only 20% of their business, so 25% of their business that's affected just the Medicare component. But it gives us a chance to talk to them about resupply, which has a lot of runway left for growth. And secondly, the customers that we're talking with over these last couple of months since this reasonably nebulous legislation came out is that they've swiftly added into their IVRs or their call center scripts and their documentation, steps that are necessary to show that it's nonfunctional in the replacement process. So that's been the chance. The good business conversations, we think, there's growth left. And our customers are responding swiftly and efficiently. And we think it's probably a good thing for us long-term to start thinking this way.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. I guess just one more question and I'll be done. The -- you mentioned that the PCP is taking a bigger role and it's something that seems -- does seem to be happening with home testing. How do you view that? And do you think that's a good thing or bad thing? And since they're served somewhat outside of your call point, I mean, how do you ensure that those patients are ending up with ResMed equipment when you've been calling on the sleep labs to kind of convincing them to write out branded prescriptions. But if it's really dictated by a primary care doctor, then it may leave it more in sort of the hands of the HME as to what type of equipment they end up with?
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. Look, that's a good question. Years ago, we were working with Philips within Respironics in order to educate PCPs about the existence of sleep-disordered breathing. That program has now stopped, all the primary care physicians, not all of them. But most of them, the bulk of them understand sleep-disordered breathing. And what they are left familiar with is the connection with signs and symptoms of the various co-morbidities that they're dealing with. And if you look at this area, and as I said, this should be -- sleep testing should be standard of care, you couldn't produce enough sleep physicians in 100 years to deal with the patients that have sleep-disordered breathing. We think internally, the prevalence of adults is that's at some level of an AHI greater than 5 is close to 30%. I mean, Susan Redline at Harvard is using a figure of 25%. The Canadians are using a figure of 26%. In short, it is impossible for the sleep infrastructure to handle the numbers of patients. So we, in fact, have to market to the PCPs. The question is how do you do it? And the easiest way to do it is through social media. And so we're working on a number of initiatives in this space. We've worked with the Joslin Clinic at Harvard to try to educate PCPs about the fact that nearly 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes, whose first call point are the internist PCPs family physicians and so forth. So it's kind of a long-term play if you like, Michael. We're well and truly into it. We're targeting them. And it sort of -- the analogy is with asthma and diabetes without worrying about the SDB and diabetes. If every asthmatic patient had to see a respirologist, or every diabetic patient had to see an endocrinologist, the system would simply freeze. And given the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, which is roughly 3x what it is for asthma and diabetes. We absolutely have to educate the PCPs. The good news is we're finding now, with the push towards pre-authorization with HST going to AutoSet. I just mentioned that the end of last year, it was 15% going to 25%. I think it will be, this time, next year, could even be 50%, because United is going to run the program out in November. And you're going to see some -- a really big acceleration of HST to APAP. This is a much easier route for -- you don't have to be a sleep physician to understand HST and the use of AutoSet. So we are very encouraged about the information we've got back thus far. A lot of work, a lot of water that flow into this, a lot of work to do. But we think this is a perfect area to focus on. Again, Mick, do you want to say something?
Michael J. Farrell: The only thing I'd add is that in terms of influencing ResMed brand, I think is where you're also asking, Michael, that we're working with sleep physician key opinion leaders from Harvard and Stanford, but also in regional groups around the country. And we have very strong relationships with the sleep physicians in terms of influencing towards not only the awareness of sleep apnea but that ResMed's products and services are ideally treated to keep the patient adherent, which is the big message. And we're also, in addition to that, doing some e-learning approaches with both the primary care physicians and train the trainer approaches with HME sales forces. So reaching the 250,000 primary care physicians can be done through social media, e-learning and by leveraging key opinion leader sources is what I'd add to what you just heard there.
Peter C. Farrell: And without sort of beating a dead horse here, just to add a little bit of more flavor, with the PCPs, we're seeing -- it's almost a bifurcation. There may be many more phenotypes as we get more information back. But you have the PCPs that are kind of interested in doing the HST, not necessarily in putting the patients on treatment, that would be done by, as you correctly pointed out, by the -- currently, both the DMEs or the HMEs. But they would end up with a $50 or something around that order. And then there are the PCPs that actually don't want to get involved, and they are using the IDTFs. So in other words, if they recognize the patient needs help, they can just sort of say, "Well, here, listen, why don't you go and we'll give you a list of IDTFs, and you can pick a geographically close one or one with a national footprint." But we're seeing roughly that. And there'll be more clarity over the next few months in that area, maybe over the next 6 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to touch base on a couple of things, following up on of the earlier question. Peter, I know you're under 2 masks per year on average for patients. Can you talk about the typical experience in terms of when a mask actually wears out, how it does? And is that 2x or 3x a year for a compliant patient? Or is it the 1.6x that you all are getting at this point? And I know that's not necessarily why people are getting the mask today. But do you think there could be a transitional issue as we go through this that needs new requirements? And just kind of talk about those 2 points, if you would.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Ben, it's like asking how long is a piece a string, what causes a mask to wear out. Again, if -- I mean, there are all sorts reasons. The dog gets it, puts a hole in it, and it leaks or the patient has a particularly oily face and the material itself breaks down. All sorts of reasons, some people are very, very careful, they clean their mask, they look after it and so on and so forth. So there's all sorts of things that can happen out there. But our average is of the order -- it's a little a shade under 2, and that's all we can really say about that. But, Don, you might want to make a comment there. But it's really the DMEs and the HMEs working with the patients. And it's up to them to do it. We just don't get involved with that.
Donald Darkin: Yes. I agree with Peter, Ben. It's a very difficult area to really understand. It's very patient-specific, and you get quite a variability in the numbers. But generally, it's sitting around that 1.5 plus. And I think as people understand the importance of compliance and understand the importance of getting good, comfortable, effective masks, then they'll start to realize that, that number might creep up a little bit, but obviously it's a slow process at this point.
Peter C. Farrell: And I'll hazard a guess here. Ben, that with the switch to HST, and I really think that's going to accelerate. There are different views with -- even within ResMed about that. I'm -- you can call me optimistic, I just think it's going to really pick up hugely. It's going to be adopted fairly rapidly. And with that, the patients are going to be going on to AutoSet. And the beauty of the AutoSet is you get really good, solid information on mask leak and how the patient is doing. And it gives the HMEs and the DMEs the opportunity to say, hey, listen, you seem -- your treatment seems to be suboptimal. It could be the mask and ask them to check their mask or even bring the stuff in, and we'll take a look at it. So I think were going to see that number creeping up.
Donald Darkin: I thought -- just add one more thing there. I think as patients become more aware of the disease, are more aware of the importance of compliance for themselves, they will take control of that mask number as well, and I believe that will drive it even higher.
Peter C. Farrell: And so it would be consumer-driven.
Donald Darkin: Exactly.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk about the buyback. I think this year was a record year for shares bought back, just wondering how you're thinking about that looking forward.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. Well, I'll trade that one to Brett -- I mean, as you know, we've got an active program with 3.6 million shares into it. There's another 8.8 million shares approved. Basically, we think it's based on our feelings -- more than feelings, based on our projections. We think it's just damn good value. Brett, do you want to add any more flavor to that?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. It's Brett. We'll continue with the buyback. I think at this stage, we expect the buyback -- to buy back a minimum of stock to at least offset dilution from employee equity grants. So as you look at last year, that would be roughly 2 million shares. So I suppose that would be the starting point. But as Peter said, we'll -- that will be a starting point and likely to be more than that. But we have now the dividend as well that we'll be paying on a quarterly basis. But I don't think it's an either/or, I think we'll both do the dividend and continue with the share buyback as well.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But is it -- so it's unlikely to be as strong as it was this year at around 30 million shares?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. I mean, it was pretty significant this year. I mean, that's getting to quite a significant proportion of our shares that we did buy back. So I think with the context of the dividend now being paid, you'd probably expect that wouldn't be quite as aggressive as what we had done this year.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But is it fair to assume the share count might fall again?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, I think so. Well, I think you could definitely predict that.
Peter C. Farrell: Definitely. You can pick a number, I mean.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank.
Nicholas Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Nick Cameron, going for David Low. Brett, perhaps just a couple of quick questions to you and then one for Dr. Farrell. Firstly, Brett, Singapore manufacturing, just roughly what percentage does that represent now and how much more have you got to go there?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. On the Singapore manufacturing, it's probably roughly at the 50% -- about 50% of the production in Singapore now. And we've always said that, that -- what's happening there is incremental production continues to flow up to Singapore. We've also started heavy manufacturing in Malaysia as well now. So we have a small operation in Malaysia to really supplement that Singapore operation now. So it's 50%, and you expect over time that percentage will climb.
Nicholas Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And just quickly on the payout ratio implied by this result, can we sort of expect that going forward? Or is it a flat $0.17?
David Pendarvis: Well, it's -- well, I mean, the board will determine the dividend policy. And at this stage, let me say, it's $0.17 a quarter.
Nicholas Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, no problem. And then, for Dr. Farrell, if he may. I just want to get your feeling on how you're seeing compliance in the eyes of the payers at the moment on some of the product side. So I just wanted to see what your thoughts are on that. And what it is, you think, they're looking for and will ultimately come up with in the end?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I think people are recognizing that compliance is the ace in the whole. If you don't get compliance, everybody loses. In other words, a machine that's bought and gets stuck in a cupboard, you don't get replenishment and so on, so that's all obvious. But I would put it more strategically. What we do know is that patients have significantly improved quality of life. We also know -- and the data, I was referring to it in my initial comments, I mean, you've got the co-morbidities are not just heart disease and diabetes, it's peripheral neuropathy, it's cancer and so on and so forth. So it actually, treatment -- compliant treatment prevents disease progression. And we also have a significant amount of data internally. And there was a recent report about a year ago from McKinsey, which is on the Harvard website -- the Harvard Sleep Medicine website, showing that there's a return on investment in the first year for treating patients, and that is with a reduction in inpatient and outpatient services. So it's kind of like the holy grail, improve quality of life, reduce costs and stopping the progression of disease. People are becoming more and more aware of that aspect. And so compliance is the holy grail in itself for the patient. It's a holy grail, if you are compliant, for the reasons I just mentioned. I think that word is getting out, and it's -- the CMS -- actually the government did something senseful, it's sort of hard to believe, it's not often you see that. But by requiring this 90 days with 30 days continuous use, that's the CMS, this is forcing the DMEs and the HMEs to look very, very seriously at compliance because they don't get paid if the patient isn't compliant. So we've seen in some of the bigger customers, compliance sub-50 going to mid-70s. So we're seeing and maybe that's reflected also in the incredible growth that we're seeing in our replenishment program. It's getting better and better. And of course the other side of the coin is that our products are better and better. I mean, you've got much more like 75 gram masks, machines that are about a kilogram, 24 decibels, I mean, they're quiet, they're small, they're appealing and they're so much, so much easier to use. So everything is moving in the right direction. The technology is, the knowledge of the -- both the consumer and the physician, the improvements in technology and so forth. So we are seeing -- now I couldn't give you specific numbers, but I would say -- well I can give you a specific number, but it's not based on hard-nosed data, but it's somewhere around the mid-70s at one year. And once the patients are on after first month, we're seeing, even the first couple of weeks, we're seeing that, that's the way it tends to continue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Got few number questions for Brett and then a few for Dr. Farrell and the rest of the team. So Brett, just on the FX overall, given the rising shift of manufacturing to Singapore and later down onto Malaysia. Do we still have a 6-month lag as it relates to shifts in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. I mean, we're still -- still a decent chunk of those costs are in the manufacturing front. So we're still -- yes, it would be probably just overauarter. You could rule of thumb probably a quarter delay. Now we've -- if you look at inventory turnover for us now, it has improved quite a bit over the last few years. So I think the rule of thumb would be on about a quarter's lag on impact from the Aussie dollar.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then just to stay on that, is about 30% of R&D still local in Australia? And does that still play the one quarter lag as well further down the P&L?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. I mean, so the majority -- much more than that, the majority of the R&D is undertaken here in Australia. But that impact we feel straight away through normal translation. So you'll see that whatever the average rate is for the quarter, that would be reflected in our R&D spend.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And Dr. Farrell, one product question. In late July, CareFusion actually announced a Class I recall of its EnVe Ventilator. And about a year ago, I guess ResMed and CareFusion now have the distribution relationship with the Stellar 100 and 150. So I'm wondering, due to that recall, do you see an incremental opportunity for Stellar 100 and 150?
Peter C. Farrell: I'm going to give that one to Geoff Neilson. I don't know what Geoff's about to say. But I think it's almost no impact as far as -- from where I see it. But, Geoff?
Geoff Neilson: They're playing in different segments in the hospitals. So really, it's not going to have any impact.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: All right, perfect. And then last one for me and I'll get back in. Just to go back to competitive bidding. Fully understanding your comments that you're not seeing any impact, but as we look into the beginning of 2013 when the program actually gets extended, not so much that there'll be a permanent impact on the part of DMEs to sort of reposition how they negotiate with manufacturers. But do you envision any initial knee-jerk reaction as you move into and get up to 90 MSAs? And to that respect should we expect to -- maybe a moderation from low double-digit growth into the back end of '13?
Peter C. Farrell: Anthony, sort of reiterating what I've said there. We -- the first 9 MSAs we, sort of if anything, it was a slightly -- and it sounds bizarre, slightly positive impact on ASPs. We're not quite sure why that is. But let's say it had -- it virtually had no impact. We don't see -- and we've looked at this pretty carefully because people seem to be spooked by it. But our data show that it is not really having any impact at all. Now that could change, but I don't see it. We just don't see it. And again, it's 10% -- it's of the order of 10% of our total global revenues. So -- but I mean, we don't even see it impacting that 10%. The other people do apparently, but we just don't. And we are talking about real data, not guesses.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Stanton with Nomura.
David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I wonder if you could give us an update on growth rates in the U.S. for bilevels and APAP compared to the overall machine growth rate? That's my first question.
Peter C. Farrell: David, we don't give that sort of granularity. What we have said is that we're incredibly encouraged by our -- but since the bilevels have been put into the S9 platform, we're seeing some very encouraging growth, very encouraging. And as I just said, we're releasing the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A in -- also in the S9 platform, and we expect to see that being received positively. The other thing I mentioned is the HST-driven switch -- lastly, HST-driven switch too, what I said. And we expect that to continue and we're expecting in fact another 100% increase in HST, and the obvious way to go is to put patients on auto-setting devices. So we expect to see a modest to very poor growth in the low-end CPAPs and quite good growth in the high-end CPAPs. And bilevels and AutoSets, we see continuing to grow.
David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Great. And could you give us -- as my final question, give us an update on what you think market growth rates are at present in the U.S. and EU? Are you guys gaining share, I guess, is my ultimate question.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. Well you would say -- so we haven't changed our view on where we are with growth rates. It's 6% to 8%, and pretty much worldwide. Maybe it's a little higher in Asia Pac because it's starting from a lower base. So you might be able to say 8% to 10% in Asia Pac, possibly a little higher in China or in India, but it's not reached a point where it's hugely material for us just yet. But 6% to 8%, for the bulk of our business, that is Europe and the U.S. And as you saw, our constant currency growth was 13%, so that would be suggestive of market share gains. And the rate of growth for both devices, 9% in the U.S. for devices and 13% for masks. That would suggest that we're doing nicely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Louisa Abdo.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Matt Prior. Peter, if I could ask -- and maybe if Ann is on the line or if you want to pick this one to Brett. But with rest of world growth being so strong and we had anticipated the Japan would kick back in this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about Europe versus Japan? And specifically, I guess is the margin better in Asia? Or -- sorry, your business in Asia, I should say. And is the margin better in Asia than it is versus Europe? And is that one of the reasons why we saw a slightly better GM than I think the market was looking for this quarter?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, Asia Pac had been soft for a couple of quarters and it's come back full steam, whether it was the tsunami, some of that was in there, psychological issues, if you like. Asia Pac has now good growth back on stream. And we -- I referred to the challenging economic climate in Europe, I mean. However, despite that, Germany was extremely encouraging. The U.K. almost hit it out of the ballpark. But you've got obviously huge challenges in Spain, Italy and France, where there's ASP pressures. But we grew constant currency, 13% in Europe, which was pretty damn good and significantly higher than that in Asia Pac. With respect to margins, we don't really get down to talking about -- I will say slightly better margins in Asia Pac. But it's not something that is of great importance to us. I don't know whether -- Brett, do you want to add to that or Rob?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, thanks. The only thing I'd say on that is, Matt, is geographic mix wasn't really a driver of the margin. So that probably pretty much answers it.
Peter C. Farrell: Rob is going to add something.
Robert Douglas: Just to the -- markets in Asia Pac are generally higher in product. So they are -- that supports the margins a little bit and also some of the smaller Norther European countries did very well as well, so it's a mixed bag there, but netted out really good.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. Just one follow-up question and given I know Geoff is on the call. Geoff, if I can talk to you on ventilation just given that there was reference to mix in that positive U.S. Flow Gen number. I think, and obviously you already talked to some extent about the CareFusion relationship on the call, but certainly to the 9% number we saw for U.S. Flow Gen, do you see, I guess, the Stellar and ventilation contributing to that yet at somewhat of a meaningful level? Or are we still waiting for the ventilation market for ResMed in the U.S. to take flight? And I guess the final point to that is do you see competitive bidding, the medical device tax, Obamacare, slowing down any of the kind of hospital purchase decisions around ventilation products over the next 1 or 2 quarters before it really gets a head of steam?
Geoff Neilson: Okay. First of all on Stellar, globally, it's been growing very well. In the U.S., it's still in early days with CareFusion. We are seeing growth, but it's off a small base. And as far as all the other macroeconomic things, ResMed's presence in the hospital is small and not material at the moment. We obviously have plans to grow that. And so these issues aren't material at the moment.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. I'm sorry, Peter, if I can ask just one last one? Linde's acquisition of Lincare, that was a fairly big event for the sector given that we are in the midst of, as you talked about, competitive bidding concerns. Does that reinforce, I guess, your view that currently Linde doesn't see big concerns around competitive bidding because they're making acquisitions like they have with Lincare?
Peter C. Farrell: All right. You've taken the words out of my mouth. It was a very decent premium that Lincare got, so $41 a share or whatever. It's a very decent -- I mean, premium. So clearly, Linde is seeing competitive bidding as being, I would say, a nonissue. I mean, they paid big bucks. And as far as the impact upon us, I mean, we can only go on what's written in the press releases and so forth. We haven't had any in-depth discussion with either Linde or Lincare management on this. But the press releases say that they're going to be run separately. And John Byrnes, the CEO of Lincare is still in the saddle. And so we treat -- they're both big customers, but we treat it as business as usual. So good luck to Lincare and the boys. And you've said it yourself, competitive bidding doesn't seem to have much of an impact on what could be considered a very, very generous premium.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Crédit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a question on Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any granularity or detail around the contribution of ventilation growth versus pure CPAP growth just in that specific market?
Peter C. Farrell: We've always done reasonably well in the ventilation space in Europe, France and so forth. France was, as I said, was a little soft. There are price pressures occurring there. I -- there's nothing really that stands out. Geoff, do you want to comment on?
Geoff Neilson: I think and particularly in the noninvasive ventilation area, we're seeing strong growth both with our ST devices and with Stellar devices. And the life support products are holding their own, but mostly the growth is in NIV area, which is -- where the growth in ventilation is actually occurring.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: All right. And just one last question back to the U.S.. Just this shift from lower-end CPAP to APAP, it's something you guys have been talking about for quite a long time. I'm just wondering how much room there still is for that mix shift effect within your portfolio as a percentage of, I guess, not asking for data on percentage split between the 2. But over how long do you think this trend will continue to play out for your specific business?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, we think it's -- the potential is there for it to accelerate. And the reason being the push to HST is building up an an incredible storm, if you like -- or maybe slightly less than a storm. But it's happening. And growing at 50% per annum, this is going to be reflected in more switching to AutoSet. It's happening. So -- and how long will it continue? I see it continuing for several years.
Michael J. Farrell: So one -- this is Mick here. One proxy to look at is the fact that we're 15% switched to home sleep testing from PSG, and we expect that to continue. So there's 85% of the runway left in terms of the potential switch from PSG to HST. So that could be a proxy metric you could look at -- to that as a suggestion.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, at the end of this year, we expect that to be 75%. But that's still a fair chunk...
Michael J. Farrell: Still lot of runway.
Peter C. Farrell: Fair -- yes, a lot of runway.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dr. Farrell for any closing remarks.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, thank you, Chris. I think we've said enough and we'll let people go. Those that are still on the -- and I guess the final thing I'd like to say is to just thank all the ResMed employees for doing another outstanding job. We have a great team of people. And I just want to publicly thank all our employees. So thanks, guys. See you next time, as they say.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  The company has asked me to read -- address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as: Projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements.  These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which may be accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.
Peter C. Farrell: Thank you, Angela, and I think we still have some time left. And thanks, everyone for joining us. I'll begin with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO. And Brett will provide more granularity on the numbers. And then we'll go to Q&A. So first, the financials. A short summary. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues were $349.1 million, up 11% headline growth or 13% constant currency. Revenues in the Americas grew by an extremely robust 18% year-over-year to $189.9 million and ROW revenue increased by 4% headline or 7% in constant currency to $159.2 million. This represents the 69th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line that is quarter-over-quarter since we went public in 1995. And obviously we're pleased with that result and will be able to continue that record growth. Net profit after tax increased 21% to $64.6 million while GAAP EPS increased by robust 29% to $0.44 for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.46.  With respect to product performance, let me first start with masks, this category continued to perform extremely well especially in the Americas. The 3 new masks in the FX trilogy, the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX, as well as the for her versions of these masks continued to enjoy brisk sales. In fact, the Mirage FX is doing particularly well and we are steadily gaining additional share in this category. In fact, our data show that the Mirage FX is currently the biggest selling nasal mask on a global basis. And the new Swift FX Bella, mask for female patients, with loops that wrap around the ears, and this allows us to not have additional headgear, that is also doing very well and we expect to see continuing traction with it.  As we've been highlighting in the last few quarters, another big reason we continue to see strong growth in the Mask category, other than the continued introduction of outstanding products, is that there is excellent business in the resupply replenishment to the existing patient base. Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices, which are now all on the S9 device platform. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having these products configured on the small but more appealing S9 platform. In the Americas, the S9 VPAP bilevel range is also regaining market share because of its excellent quality algorithms and also the performance that we get with those algorithms. The bilevels are providing strong value proposition for both HMEs and positions. Growth in the basic Flow Generator segment is still problematic and, partially, this is driven by the positive mix shift to APAP or our AutoSet from basic CPAP. And this is primarily due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing. Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment there. Although sales were relatively strong in Germany and the U.K. Although the European economic climate remains somewhat muted bilevels, AutoSets and Stellar Stellar products all continue to do well.  We also just announced the release of our new patient compliance management solution called EasyCare Online. This innovative new tool used by sleep labs home medical equipment and DMEs and other healthcare providers aggregates usage and efficacy data from sleep-disordered breathing, obviously patient's on CPAP therapy, with simply a single click. Simple to use while saving time and money. The EasyCare Online employs a secure cloud-based system that provides compliance data that can differentiate our customers and is critical in today's environment.  The S9 Flow Generators, our FX mask series plus now the new EasyCare Online bring superior compliance in patient management for quick and easy access to patient data in one centralized cloud-based location, unlimited providers can be associated with each patient to ensure the best possible therapy. We are quite excited about EasyCare Online.  Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow, particularly in Europe and Asia. We launched the Stellar 150 in Europe at the end of the calendar year and we are seeing incremental acceptance. These ventilator products will roll out progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPs, our new automatic bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development. We also have further plans for ventilation.  The new Grundler humidification about the HumiCare D900, is in a controlled product launch in Europe and going well. And we are working on FDA's submission to launch the 900 in the U.S. in fiscal 2013. This product will initially launch in the homecare setting which of course is our strength but also are planning to do a hospital lunch.  On the HST, home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continues to steer patients towards HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG test, or polysomnography, and they are encouraging the use of HST as the first line of diagnosis. Currently, Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives for PSG to steer patience towards HST. We expect this to continue.  In 2011, we estimate 15-plus-percent of all test for HST could even be as high as 20%. We expect to see a continuing adoption of HST during 2012 and onwards. My guess, in this area, is that it will increase another 100% this year.  On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder, breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize. For example, a new study in the April issue of Pediatrics by Bonuck et al from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, show that early life sleep disorder breathing in children had a strong persistent statistical correlation to serious behavioral and social-emotional difficulties. And by the time the children reach 4 years old, 40 to 100 -- by the time they reach 4 years old, excuse me. And by the time that they're at age 7, the prevalence of these behavioral and emotional difficulties was between 40% to 100%. The study published also in circulation, Heart Failure by [indiscernible] from the University of Birmingham, showed that moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea can cause changes in the heart shape and function, that is increased mass, thickening of the heart wall and reduced pumping ability. The new study used to better define and control patient group in newer 3D echocardiograms.  And then New York University reported results of the study that showed simply using BMI misses nearly 40% of sleep disorder breathing in obese patients. And as much as 50% of sleep disorder prevalence in women. Obviously, this is something that suggest that BMI is not what it's touted to be and the people probably ought to be having sleep tests as a standard of care in just about all patients. We expect that, that will come in the future.  And as a brief update, our own clinical study which is the SERVE-HF on the use of adaptive servo-ventilation to treat chronic heart failure patients or sleep disorder breathing in chronic heart failure patients, we now have 1,000 patients currently enrolled.  A quick update, before I pass over to Brett, our management changes. Karen Borg has been appointed as President of Asia Pacific and that was in January of this year. Her career prior to joining ResMed had commercial diversity covering strategic and global marketing, M&A, sales and general management. And during the past 20 years, Karen has worked in Australia, the U.K., Russia, Taiwan and the U.S.A. And more recently, since 2003, she was in the leadership roles with Johnson & Johnson and both Australia and the U.S. Anne Reiser has been appointed President, Europe, and that was in March of this year. Anne has previously served as ResMed's Chief Operating Officer in France since 2007. Anne has demonstrated a great track record in building and leading our successful French organization with both strong sales growth and market share increases. Prior to joining ResMed and worked in various European companies for such companies as Zimmer, American Home Products, Hollister and the most recent one was Medtronic.  Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional granularity on the financials, then we'll take any questions. Brett?
Brett A. Sandercock: Right. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the March quarter was $349.1 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Income from operations for the quarter was $76.5 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $64.6 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the March quarter was 60.3%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin continue to benefit from favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable currency movements. Looking forward to the balance of fiscal year 2012, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 61%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product costs through supply chain efficiencies, product design and manufacturing improvements. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 29.5%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2012. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.4 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 18%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, compared to the year ago figure of 7.4%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline. As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.6 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.9 million. We also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation this quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $189.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $159.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. Breaking up revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $78.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $111.3 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter underpinned by strong contributions from our nasal mask segment and continued growth in accessories.  For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $105.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $53.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generators sales increased by 10% while Masks and other increased by 16%.  Cash flow from operations was $86 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $9.9 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares, a consideration of $67 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 10.8 million shares, a consideration of $302.2 million. The 10.8 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 7.3% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of March, we had approximately 11.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. Our balance sheet remains strong, net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $540 million. And of 31 March, total assets was the $2.1 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion.  I will now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Let's see if we could start with the bilevel result. I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of whether after the difficulty you had a year ago, whether you think sales are back to normal? Or whether you think that will remain a driver for the next quarter or so?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, as you were aware, David, in the old S8 box, in fact, the adaptive servo-ventilator, the ACS products were in the S7 box, which is really outdated. So I think the switch to having the bilevels and all the auto setting products including the ASV products in the S9 platform, as I said, has just really attracted people. Now whether we're back to, you can always do better, we were very encouraged, obviously, by the fact that people did gravitate back to our bilevel products. I mean the algorithms were all pretty solid. Maybe I'll ask Geoff to comment on that but I -- and Don maybe, but I think we still got some more, we got some more runway ahead of us with bilevels. We'd like the whole market, but that's a bit unrealistic. But we're very satisfied with where we are. You want to add anything?
Unknown Executive: I think there's a bit of runway way ahead of us as well. But we're quite happy with where we are at the moment.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's really important whether the dollars are sort of empowered where they were prior to the decline?
Peter C. Farrell: You mean in terms of percentages?
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Well, percentages or dollars. Just to add [indiscernible] or whether 75% back.
Peter C. Farrell: We'd be just giving qualitative -- we don't get to that sort of granularity, David. As I said, let's leave it. We still have some runway to go.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. The other topic I wanted to touch on was the rest of world sales. We've now seen, for a few quarters this year, we've seen sales great in a bit of a single-digit. I'm just wondering, if you could comment on what you've seen. I'm sort of particularly interested in breaking between European sales and what you saw and Asia Pacific region?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, as we've always said, the Asia Pac area tends to be a bit lumpy. We saw actually quite encouraging growth in India and China but obviously that's from a small base. The big markets there are Australia and Japan, and Japan tends to be extremely lumpy and you see these swings in the quarter but you're only looking at to say in the vicinity of 10% -- 9%, 10% of our total revenues in Asia Pac. Europe as we said on the last call, and as we still believe, the market there is 6% to 8% looking at their constant currency growth that's exactly where it was right bang and smack in the middle, 7%. I had mentioned that Germany was encouraging and that the U.K. was encouraging. France was less encouraging and the reason is this is still, if you like the post headache from the reimbursement changes in last October, where there was a 6% reduction. We see France coming back into the fold and that was probably the major reason given that our biggest market, obviously, is the Americas, which is around 54% and then you've got the next 2 biggest markets are Germany and France. So a little bit of weakness in either of those is obviously going to impact the numbers. But I think actually, we were reasonably encouraged with the European figures, given that there is a bit of a -- as you know, a malaise in the world economy.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to just follow up -- a question for you and maybe a question for Brett, if I may. For you Peter, talk about your view on the durability of the mix dynamics? And I get the sense that a major contributor to your revenue growth but also supporting unit growth, particularly, the overall growth number. And how many quarters or years do you think we have as a tail from bilevel and a conversion to auto?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, it's sort of a gradual thing, Ben, although we're seeing an acceleration of AutoSets and that is driven, we think, primarily, by the HST push. And there's a lot of runway there if you like. And basically, what were talking about here is that it's faster, better and cheaper if you like. And I think the insurers are now tweaking to that fact. The sleep labs will continue in their role, I mean, there are 90 different sleep disorders but one of them shouldn't be plugging up the labs, particularly, since a 5-year-old child -- recently some 5-year-old child would be able to diagnose the disorder breathing given the HST products that are around, not just ours. And the patient that's given the HST device immediately goes home that night and within a day or so is on treatment, whereas with the sleep lab you've obviously you've got the delay, you've got to wait until you can get into the labs and it might be a couple of weeks up to a couple of months. And what we've seen is that our data have shown that -- all data that we've paid to collect have shown that roughly 30% of patients who have been given a script to go to a sleep lab don't show up. Whereas if the sleep lab offers both HST and PSG, it tends to be more like 2%. So it's even in the interest of sleep labs to offer HST independently the fact that the Aetnas and Uniteds and Humanas and so forth are now requesting pre-authorization. So it's kind of a long way to answer your question but we see that continuing, I said I think it'll be probably up -- it could be something like this time next year, something like 40% of all tests. And all going well, if we had our wishes it would be cardiologists, endocrinologists and anesthesiologists all doing sleep tests and referring only the tough ones to sleep labs or sleep physicians. I think we see that happening. It may not be the cardiologists and endocrinologists themselves doing it but maybe the nurses or nurse practitioners and it's certainly much better for the patients and given the prevalence in those spaces, that is in Type 2 diabetes and cardiology in general. In fact, I've heard from a cardiologist the other day that he said that 40% of his patients have sleep disorder breathing and I figured, the figure that we use is about 50% and these aren't patients with heart failure, these are just the regular patients with A-fib or whatever else is wrong with their heart.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Sure. And so I guess, Peter, coming back and that's a helpful description, but coming back to the durability on that mix dynamic, it sounds like it's not 4 quarters, this is in your mind 2 or 3 years plus. So that helps offset the weakness you're seeing obviously in the low-end as well as give you much better pricing power versus trying to compete at that low end against whatever else is going on out there. Is that a fair way to think about it?
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, I think that's a fair assessment. We see continual weakness in the low end. And as HST kicks in, you don't have the option of going to the sleep lab, so you would actually have to go to an APAP, [indiscernible] and AutoSet. And we see that continuing to happen. That doesn't mean -- I mean sleep labs are not going to go away, but you're right it's not -- this is not 2 or 3 quarters, this is 2 or 3 years of the switch occurring. But it might happen more quickly, I mean, maybe that people just tweak to it and say, "You know what? We're going to push this." And it's not as though -- I mean for the IDTFs, for example, I mean, they're getting something like $20 for doing oxygen tests, I mean, the oxygen level of the patient, SpO2, and they get $200 to $250 for a sleep test. I mean that's pretty -- it's pretty attractive to the independent testing facilities.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then perhaps for you, you gave us a little bit of a directional help on gross margin, the effect of currency, can you kind of walk us through the P&L and how currency affected your top through the earnings and give us a sense of what was in the other line this quarter, because I know it does move a lot of fair bit. And then I just wanted -- I was hoping that you could give us where you think the effective share count will be for the fourth quarter?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes. In terms of the overall P&L, on the top line year-on-year the impact on currency was around $4 million negative. If you work through all the currency through to the bottom line, it was an adverse impact of $0.02 for us this quarter, so that was on the currency front. On the share front, the weighted average share, I think, where we finished the quarter was probably around 146.5 probably a number that the south of that would be probably where we estimate Q4 at.
Operator: And gentlemen your next question will come from the line of Matthew Prior of Merrill Lynch.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a two-part question. Just, Peter, if I could, can I just check the U.S. industry growth rate is still that 6% to 8% that you've been talking the last couple of quarters. I know you mentioned that in the year but you just checking it with the U.S. and just in terms of the whole home sleep testing contribution to the industry growth and the doubling comment that you made. Are you saying that these sleep labs, traditional PSG guys, getting involved in the HST game at all?
Peter C. Farrell: Your first question, Matt, on the growth, we still think it's 6% to 8%. We're obviously extraordinary happy with the growth in the U.S. I mean 18% is not something that we would've predicted but we were coming off fairly weak comparables from Q3 of 2011. So that certainly explains a lot of the growth there. So 6% to 8%, yes, that's what we're still using as the expected growth in the U.S. market. As far as sleep labs are concerned, yes, we are seeing more adoption of HST and it's hard to know how fast that will go. I mean, if you're the sleep lab and you're getting $1,200, give or take, for a PSG versus $250, say, for the HST, obviously, there's an incentive financially to do as much of the PSG stuff as you can, but there will be continual pressures there, and I think if the lab realizes that they're actually missing out on patients because of the inconvenience. I mean, patients have to bring a duffel bag in, stay overnight and get all wired up, et cetera, et cetera, and generally it's a few weeks before you can get into the lab and so on and so forth. And I think that there will be more and more of the labs adapting HST, at least offering one or the other. And how quickly that -- like anything, conservative labs who think it's bad practice or they just want to get involved then other labs who are more entrepreneurial. So you see the writing on the wall and it is on the wall. They will be the early adopters, the entrepreneurial ones. So we see that continuing.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So it doesn't sound, Peter, as if it's a main contributor to that 15% or even 20% in some cases, you think that the PSG guys are really yet to weigh in to this, which could be another factor to HST takeup ...
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I'll throw that to Mick, he's the president of Americas, but what would you say to that?
Michael J. Farrell: I'd say that 25% to 30% of sleep labs are actually now experimenting in home sleep testing. So of that trailing 12 months, where we're looking at 15% to 20% of the tests being home sleep test, a large portion of that will be the IDTFs and the entrepreneurial home sleep testing companies that are out there. But a growing portion of that is sleep labs that are starting to recognize, not only as we talk about that it can reduce the leakage rate when you offer the choice of home sleep testing versus PSG. But also that sleep labs are realizing that just under 20% of the covered lives in this country, now have pre-authorization requirements for PSG. And that is up from 15% just 90 days ago. So they're watching this trend and they're saying, I want to get involved in this and get ahead of this curve, so that I can appropriately and properly treat my patients. So they're definitely getting involved. But to your point, Matt, I do think there's runway ahead as they get more involved over the coming quarters and fiscal years.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. My second question was just in regards to round one of competitive bidding. We hear a lot of anecdotes around the impact of round one, not so much in terms of obviously the price reduction in the 34%, but more in regards to the slowdown in volumes that have occurred in those 9 MSAs. Can you just talk to whether or not you've seen that or give us any kind of anecdotals around the impact in round one on volumes?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes. So, Matt, it's a great question. So we're running a real-time experiment in those 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, those 9 MSAs. And we're just entering the fourth quarter of running and were able to compare the 3 quarters that we've seen of the 3-quarter [indiscernible] in those 9 cities and we found that the growth rates within those 9 MSAs that we're into round one are equivalent to the general market growth rates across the U.S. market. So we have not seen a slowdown in revenue. We did see sort of split of 2 categories of customers within those, where you have the winners and the losers. The winners within those 9 cities, clearly, grew at a much faster rate and the losers started to decline in their purchases from us, which is logical. But the total volume, when you look at the mix between the winners and losers was a consistent revenue story. What you also saw is some of the winners were more sophisticated customers with larger economies of scale, larger abilities to go after install patient base and to market and sell replenishment programs to get patients who maybe, who are not as adherent and compliant to their device and regular use of masks and filters and tubing on a regular base. So you know, all in all, in those 9 cities, it's been a wash with some winners and some losers but we see good potential in partnering with the types of companies that have been winning in those areas.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: One of my questions have been answered. Your long-term debt increased in the quarter, is that associated with share repurchases?
Peter C. Farrell: Primarily, yes. Brett, you do want to...
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say, Peter, yes. It will pretty much will be associated with the buyback, yes.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. CareFusion, how are they doing in the hospital environment which your new ventilator products?
Peter C. Farrell: It's still early on and the sales, obviously, selling to the hospital is a longer sales cycle. They're pitching the product to hospital customers and we're seeing some interest. They have a pipeline of interest that we've been reviewing with them but it's still too early to say.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The conversation that we've been having about home sleep testing, is it the -- the shift appears to be not that is bringing more people into the pool but that it's a shift from Mr. Jones doesn't go to the lab, he goes into the home. Is that the right way to think about it?
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, I think so. It's too early to draw any other conclusions I think. However, I think we're going to see, as the word gets out to the primary care physicians and so forth, what we've seen over the years is if you go back, let's say 5 or more years, PCPs in general were bamboozled by sleep disorder breathing, they virtually weren't looking for it. Now they're aware of it and the big -- they're ignorant of the existence of it. Now the ignorance tends to be more along the lines of the signs and symptoms, like they didn't think of referring patients for sleep test as often as they should but some of that resistance, we believe, and we need more data on this, we believe is, "Oh my God, if I send a patient to write a script for a sleep lab, it's going to be 1 to 2 months. And then, it's just I know they won't do it or blah, blah, blah. If they, themselves, either get involved in HST, which they easily can, and were trying to work out some strategies, whereby we make it easy for them to do this or hook them up with IDTFs or VirtuOx or IDS or Midmark or one of the others. But without -- I think we'll see some movement there and we'll see a pick up in, I think, diagnosis the use of HST beyond the sleep people themselves. And that will...
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Is there an economic benefit to you of the home sleep testing? And can we quantify that?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, yes. I mean, the economic benefit is that the patients have to go on to an auto-setting device and that we get an uptick in revenue for that reason. In other words, you don't have the option of going to -- you don't do HST and then send the patient to a sleep lab to have the device pressure set. And the fact is, that there is now a substantial amount of literature showing that, in fact, if anything compliance is better with auto-setting products. It's certainly no worse, we can say that. And there are data that's coming from Europe, from Canada and from the U.S. which supports that. So I don't think physicians now are concerned about a compliance issue and, of course, it benefits us with a slight uptick in revenues.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: My final question is a lot of companies had an extra selling day in the month of February and they've been able to quantify the impact to revenue. Did you have that occur?
Brett A. Sandercock: Joanne, it's Brett. Yes, we did have that extra day on us. But if you average that out it'd be in the order of $5 million or something around that sort of number.
Peter C. Farrell: It might be more like $3 million to $4 million maybe, whatever.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I'm just wondering, can you talk about the Medicare prepayment reviews that are going out for CPAP? And do you expect those to have any kind of an impact on your business?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, I'll turn that to Mick.
Michael J. Farrell: So there are always Medicaid getting involved with select customers and one of the biggest issues with our customers right at the moment for Medicare is the number of audits going through from -- versus just the prepayment is just another issue they deal with. We think that there are many opportunities in the growth area within the market for customers within their Medicare as well as their private pay customers. Medicare constitutes just around 20% to 30% of the market and for some customers it sort of 5% to 10%. So there are challenges with Medicare as a payor, but they're also a big chunk of the payor market, so there's some opportunities there as well.
David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I appreciate the color on HumiCare, that we should see that in fiscal 2013. Anything else in the pipeline you'd like to highlight?
Peter C. Farrell: I'll refer that to Geoff. Do you want to comment there?
Geoff Neilson: Well, obviously we're doing a controlled product launch of HumiCare in Europe, we expect to be launching in fiscal '13. We're currently putting together the 510(k)submission, which will go in shortly. So we could expect to launch that when that comes through with the FDA approval. We obviously have a pipeline that we're working with Grundler on in terms of humidification portfolio. But obviously, what we're looking at now is doing a proper job at launching this first product to homecare and then to the hospital.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Saul Hudassin with Crédit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A quick question, you mentioned some further plans for the ventilation business. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what that might entail?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, we've just, well, not just, at the end of the calendar year, released the Stellar 150 with iVAPS and basically we have a commitment to this space now, I mean Geoff has been building up the strategic business unit in respiratory care and we're going to continue with product evolution and we think in one case we might have -- it's probably not, you wouldn't describe it as a revolution, but we're working on some interesting future products. Put it that way.
Saul Hadassin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a question for Brett. The constant currency growth in R&D since it picked up in the last 3 quarters, is that kind of a new run rate that we should be thinking about? And is that tied into increased investment on the ventilation side of the business?
Brett A. Sandercock: There's probably, I mean, the acquisitions we undertook earlier in the year would probably, that would tick that up a little, by a couple of percent Saul as well. So probably our run rate would be a little low, probably sort of mid-teen type run rate. We've, I mean, at the end of the day, we really wanted to put our R&D dollars into the products we want to deliver into the markets. So that sort of drives the R&D spend. Through the course of this year, it's gone a little higher but it doesn't mean to say, necessarily trend down a little bit as we go through fiscal 2013 for example. So it's really dependent on where we're driving in terms of product development and what stage we're at on some of the projects.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, and to add a bit more there, there was an uptick with the health informatics, of course. We got, I mean, Don Darkin and his team did a terrific job getting EasyCare Online out and that was a monster challenge. And we have to do it. So a lot of resources were put into that and there were newer resources. And of course, as Brett says, the acquisitions.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen your next question will come from the line of David Stanton of Nomura.
David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Look, just 2 things, firstly, Peter, perhaps you give us a bit of an update on the timeline for the results of the SERVE-HF trial. And for Brett, lower-than-expected tax rate than were expecting, should we be thinking that kind of tax rate ongoing?
Peter C. Farrell: David, on the survey, I mentioned that we hit 1,000 patients. The plan is 1,260 this is not something that's going to be over quickly. And, however, what we are doing is we're doing a little side studies. I mean, the end points here are mortality and morbidity and they're pretty hard-nosed end points. But what we're also funding, some out of the ResMed Foundation and some direct from the company, are smaller studies where we're looking at ejection fraction, echocardiography and so on so forth. There should be some quick -- quicker results out of that. But I think to move the needle, it will be the survey and we're talking a couple of years more before we have anything that we can really talk about, sadly. It's expensive but that's just what you got to do.
Brett A. Sandercock: David, on the tax front. I'm comfortable with that 20%, 23% level at the moment in shorter-term. Basically, as we sort of ramp-up or increase production in Singapore, there's probably some opportunity there, the tax rate may adjust a little lower than that into the future. But at this point in time, I'm comfortable around that level.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Steve Wheen with JP Morgan.
Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a question with regards to pricing. You've obviously mentioned in previous quarters that ASP declined is sort of [indiscernible]. So I just wonder if you're seeing the same sort of of dynamic at the moment, particularly when some channels we speak to are highlighting that on the APAP side, there has been some price increases off from you guys?
Peter C. Farrell: Put it this way, that's news to me and I think to people around the table. Gee, it's a lovely thought. But I think we're seeing something like a 2% to 3% to 5%, 5% is thankfully at the high end of what we're seeing. I mean, I had to predict that I mean, obviously, any time the DMEs and the HMEs have an opportunity to bring in some bad news, which they have all result in price reductions, they will do so. So this is not a new game. This is a very, very old game. But we're not seeing anything untoward with ASPs and we're certainly not seeing any increases with our devices. We think they're worth more but it's hard to get people to pay for what they're really worth.
Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Given the dynamic that's going on, in APAP could you see that particular category remains -- pricing remains flat and that it was not subject to price decline?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, let Mick take a shot at that.
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Steve. Maybe what you're seeing is the blended ASP. There's some effects where it could be neutral, but certainly within a category, we're seeing that and I think on previous calls we've said a 5% to 7% per annum price reduction is what we see, we're saying in this call it's around 5%, which is about where we're at, but if you move from a CPAP to an APAP category and you move your mix in that, your blended ASP can appear neutral for a customer. But within the category of order set, there has been no increase in process and in this macroeconomic environment, I don't see going forward either and that sort of 5% go forward ASP reduction and we have to get off of it now, cost reductions and supply chain improvements, and to keep that gross margins really are is sort of where we're at.
Peter C. Farrell: I mean, obviously, internally, if we see much slower growth in the low-end and higher growth in the higher-end, well our ASP is going to go up as an average.
Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, okay. And then just finally with regards to masks and your accessories in the U.S., you previously indicated that the DMEs haven't been, well, historically, have been refreshing the masks for their customers as regularly. Is that sort of -- are people trending now to replace masks in line with their reimbursement programs, now? Is that what's underpinning that growth?
Peter C. Farrell: Well, there's a lot of potential runway there. Clearly, when we look at the average number of masks sold per device per annum, we just see it is a huge opportunity for both us in the DMEs in HMEs. I don't know, Don, whether you want to add anything to that, but this is an area which -- when you've got millions of patients that are out there now and it's close to 6 million in the U.S. and we see it's less than 50% of what the revenues could be in that space. Less than 50%.
Donald Darkin: Yes. I think, as we are trying to push on this adherence compliance process, we're seeing more people coming on board with these programs. And, again, there's quite a bit of room here for us to adjust in a positive sense.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Belt & Company.
Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Just as a reminder, how much of the manufacturing is currently or has currently moved to Singapore?
Peter C. Farrell: Rob, you can take that? We're getting close to 50%.
Robert Douglas: Continual incremental and there has been quite a shift from the last year of additional increments and yet it's not quite 50% but it's getting there on product mix basis.
Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: And is 50% kind of a goal? Or would you go beyond that?
Robert Douglas: Well sort of in terms of the longer-term strategy, we'll be looking now at other sites and we actually have a facility in Malaysia as well that started up out of some of the headgear stuff that we've done and we'll be looking at that and other options to where we go in the future.
Peter C. Farrell: But the Singaporean environment is, they have well trained people and they're willing to work with you on the tax front and quality people with reasonable charges is attractive.
Robert Douglas: And capacity utilization, obviously, one of the other key factors in keeping it efficient, so we like Singapore.
Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Sure. And if I could follow up with one more. Last quarter, you talked about initiative to notify long-time CPAP patients with the benefits of newer devices. Could you just comment on what how's that coming along?
Peter C. Farrell: Yes, well the warranty on devices. So in our manuals, it's a 5-year life, if you like. I mean, we get patients that have been using our devices happily for over 10 years and when you pull them apart, you sometimes get a bit of a surprise. But we are sort of trying to get the word out to people, particularly, since over the years, the algorithms have improved significantly, the noise levels have come down, the performance overall is just so much better. We think the patients will be better off by switching their units out and we do have a program to do that. And Rob maybe you can talk but -- more specifically we're trying to, if you like, focus on the S8, the previous line of products, and switch them out, S8 and even the S7, I guess. And there a lot of those still out there and the S7s are well and truly over the 5-year mark. And the S8s have now I think we're probably, I would imagine earlier a few hundred thousand now that are not at the 5-year mark. So we see that as an opportunity and we're sort of trying to make a full-court press to make it attractive for patients to upgrade. Rob, do you want to add?
Robert Douglas: I think that we just think the S9 is going to be providing better therapy and it makes good sense for people to move onto it.
Peter C. Farrell: And we recommend that at the end of the 5 years that you have a maintenance anyway. And why spend the money on maintenance if we have an attractive price for an upgrade like a trade-in as opposed to maintenance. And we are recommending that after 5 years, you really do need to have your device looked at. So instead of spending money out of your pocket on an old device, why not upgrade. That's the pitch.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities U.S.A.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: I guess I just wanted to follow-up on what Mick was saying about the analysis that you guys had done on the 9 MSAs. I understand that those are comments on volume but I guess I'm just wondering what you saw with regard to pricing especially given the bifurcation you mentioned between the winners and losers, it seems like some of those winners would end up buying CPAPs in larger quantities, so would they then be getting better prices on this units, the masks and flow generators that their buying or not. So did you see any impact on your pricing in those cities?
Michael J. Farrell: Yes, Mike, good question. My comments we're actually about revenue. So saw that the winners that their revenue and, obviously, their volumes but their revenue grew and that the losers -- that they're revenue decline with us but on wash on a revenue basis it was a neutral element for us. So we were actually able to see that across those 9 cities we were revenue neutral. So my comments were around revenue not just volume.
Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. I guess, there has been some interest in the potential requirement of truckers getting tested for sleep apnea. And I guess there were sort of a league of the federal motor safety. -- Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration proposal this week or maybe it was last week. And I'm just wondering if that kind of was consistent with what you expected it to be, I think there were seeing a BMI over 35 they have to be tested. And then I'm just wondering what percentage of the population you think what kind of fall into that range.
Peter C. Farrell: Yes. Well, none of that was a surprise. It was a surprise to us that it was the directive was issued and then later that day, it was retracted, and that was last week. It was sort of bizarre. I mean the Secretary LaHood comes in and says, it was a clerical error and it shouldn't have gone out. I mean we don't see any changes to that. We think it's going to come down from 35 to 30 BMI. And as I indicated in my remarks, BMI is a very loose way to decide on who needs a sleep test because 50% of people, in fact, with SDB, I will say, are not obese and it's due to other problems like retrognathia and Marfan syndrome and a whole bunch of other things. Obesity obviously impacts. There are 9 million commercial drivers in this country. We see it as a big opportunity. And frankly, we are just puzzled. We've been heavily involved in working with the National Transportion Safety Board and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In fact, our people have been, as I say, the staff really in terms of drawing the issue to peoples' attentions, we work with, as you know, Schneider trucking. We're also facilitating some publication of a study which was done with J.B. Hunt commercial drivers as well and that'll be coming out in the next few months. Again, suggesting that it's a very wise thing to have these people tested for sleep disorder breathing. As far as the prevalence, there's a wide range but the data that we think is pretty robust it's roughly 30% of all drivers have it at a level which is significant enough that they really do need to be sleep tested and treated. So it's big. And if you translate 30% of all those commercial drivers, I mean, it's 2.5 million to 3 million drivers and it could even be higher. I mean, as the data come in. The more we dig in these areas, the bigger the numbers or the bigger the prevalence tends to be. So yes, we think it is an incredibly exciting area and it's exciting because it's preventive of accidents, improves quality of life and reduces the cost for the carriers because there's less turnover by the drivers, they feel better, they work better, and we've got all the data, it's like the Holy Grail, if you prevent accidents, you improve peoples' quality of life and you save the company's money. And we think the FMCSA is being a little too prescriptive. But sending out that, publishing that they're going to do it and then the same day, retracting it, just is bizarre but maybe it's not a surprise, it is the government.
Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just a really quick final question for Brett on the EPS impact of currency in the quarter. What was that?
Brett A. Sandercock: Yes, for us it was a negative impact of $0.02 on the bottom line this quarter.
Operator: We are now at the 1-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final comments.
Peter C. Farrell: Well, thank you, Angela, and thanks, everybody, for listening. We'll stop it right there.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2012 ResMed Inc earnings conference call. My name is Stacy and I will be your conference moderator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. In addition the company asks me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets of the company’s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed’s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company’s website at www.resmed.com. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed’s Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead sir.
Peter Farrell: Thanks Stacy, and thanks everyone for joining us. I’ll begin as usual with a short summary and then pass the call over to Brett Sandercock, ResMed’s CFO and then we’ll go into a Q&A. So first, the financials. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues in the second quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $333 million, which was also up 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew by an encouraging 12% to $182.5 million and ROW revenue increased by 5% at the headline and also in constant currency terms to $150.2 million. GAAP EPS increased 14% to $0.42 for the quarter and I believe consensus was $0.38 which we comfortably beat and if we exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.44which we would suggest represents effective management and operational excellence and efficiency. With the respect to product performance, masks continued to perform well across the globe and we continue to take market share. The three masks, new masks in the FX trilogy that is the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX as well as the four versions of these masks continue to do extremely well and with the success of the Mirage, we are gaining additional share in nasal masks category which recently had been a week spot for us. And we just launched the Swift FX [Bella] mask giving female patients the choice of how they wear the masks since it offers hair management solutions in brief and we expect this to also improve patient compliance and in brief the mask has a loop which wraps around the ears without any straps on the forehead or head itself. And as we recently been highlighting, there is a further reason we continue to see strong growth in the mask category other than the introduction of the new products is that there is excellent business in the resupply or replenishment of masks to the existing patient base. And in this context we are working with our DME and HME customers to help them leverage this business opportunity. Global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven by ventilation and bilevel devices including significant contribution from our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation line, the VPAP Adapt and the S9 AutoSet CS, but in addition also the Stellar products. And we can provide more granularity on that if people wish. In the Americas, bilevels are regaining share as they prove to be a strong value proposition for HMEs and physicians who we believe are scripting them. Growth in the basic flow generator market is still somewhat problematic. It continues to be a challenging environment and actually proved to be a bit more so this quarter in Europe due to difficult macroeconomics or the macroeconomic environment there which people don’t need very much explanation on. The European climate is a little bit cautious and perhaps nervous and the market has slowed somewhat, looking more like growth levels in the US, that is around the 6% to 8% mark. But because we don’t have any material business in those countries or in the countries under severe distress, we’re somewhat isolated from the potential basket cases if you like, the so called PIIGS. Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow progressively in Europe and parts of Asia. The 150 Stellar was launched in Europe at the end of the calendar year and both products have received regulatory approval in Japan and will launched there soon. These vents will rollout progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS which is an automated bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development and there will be more offerings in this space over time. Sales of Stellar 100 in the US are ramping to expectations with the CareFusion sales team. They’re also now selling our masks along with the ventilators. The new Greundler humidification product, HumiCare D900 started controlled product launch in Germany and we’re doing further CPLs a little later on in France and Sweden. We are also working on FDA approval and we have to launch the 900 in the US in early 2013 or if not before pending FDA approval. On the HST or the Home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continue to see toward HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG sleep test while encouraging the use of HST. At this point Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives from PSG to see patients to HST. In 2011 we estimate approximately 15% of all the test or all the sleep test where HST and we expect to see continuing adoption of HST during 2012. It’s difficult to look into the crystal ball and know exactly what that growth will be. I think it is going to double others within ResMed a more conservative, but we will see what it turns out to be. To some extent, this takes the pressure of low level CPAPs because as people would understand with HST, there is no setting of pressure in the sleep lab which means that physician DMEs, HMEs have to point towards APAP or our autosetting devices. So that’s all good from our point of view. On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize a study conducted recently in Spain with over a thousand women, just published in the annals of Internal Medicine demonstrated the severe obstructive sleep apnea was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death in women and that adequate sleep as treatment has been shown to reduce that risk. Also in a recent study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry researchers have suggested that schizophrenic patients have an improved quality of life if their sleep disorders are treated. And finally in the area of occupational health and safety, advisors to the FMCSA the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration at a meeting last December recommended that the agency toughen up its approach to evaluation and treatment for sleep disorder breathing. The Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee and the Medical Review Board have formed a joint subcommittee charged with producing recommendations for an eventual rule that will set standards for sleep apnea screening, evaluation and treatment. They plan to present this strategy next April. Now let me turn the call over to Brett. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks Peter. I will just run through the Q2 results. Revenue for the December quarter was $332.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue also increased 9%. Income from operations for the quarter was $67.3 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of unfavorable currency movements. Net income for the quarter was $62.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.42, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 59.7% up sequentially from Q1 FY12. On a sequential basis our gross margin benefited from favorable product mix, improvement in manufacturing and logistics costs. Sequentially currency movements had a minimal impact on our gross margin this quarter. Looking-forward for the balance of FY12, we expect to have gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product cost through supply chain efficiencies, product design, and manufacturing improvements. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $100.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 30.2% compared to the year ago figure of 29.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 21%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.3% compared to the year ago figure of 7.3%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline. As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.7 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 25.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 24%. Turning now to revenue in more detail, overall sales in the Americas were $182.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $150.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 5% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $80.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $102 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our portfolio of masks and continued growth in accessories. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $100.1 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 2%. Masks and other sales were $50.1 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 3% while masks and others increased by 16%. Cash flow from operations was a record $110.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.3 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $22.9 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 4.1 million shares for the consideration of $110.5 million. For the first half of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for consideration of $235.2 million. The 8.5 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 5.7% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of December, we had approximately 14 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. On January 25, we increased our syndicated bank credit facility from 300 million to 400 million, providing the group with additional funding flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were 497 million. At December 31, total assets stood at 2 billion and net equity was 1.6 billion. I’ll now hand the call back to your operator for your questions.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: So, Peter, can you talk a little bit more about two things please, for my question. First is international volumes with a kind of steady through the quarter or getting worse or you really looking at maybe a more difficult environment than you saw in fourth quarter for the balance of fiscal ’12 and then ended a balance of the year, and then second, on the product mix side, that was a pretty impressive performance on gross margin. Is that something that was unusual in terms of the mix this quarter because that gives us a pretty broad range for the year. So maybe talk to the mix and the dynamics there please?
Peter Farrell: Let me just address the gross margin first Benefit. Obviously getting close to 60% was pretty encouraging. But I think the main thing is and I will let Rob chime in here particularly regarding Europe and maybe for the first question back to Robert. You will note that we had really encouraging growth, as you know the Adaptive Servo-Ventilator products are now in the S9 box and we saw a very good growth there and of course there is also the Stellar and the new Bi-Levels in the S9 box. So higher margin products for sure and that is pretty encouraging. I think we are kind of delighted that we made 60% gross margin. With respect to what is happening in Europe, I mentioned in my remarks that we were relatively insulated from the Greece, Spain and so forth. We did have some relevant business in Italy and however that was the quite good and obviously the big ones of Germany and France,. The 5% figure down a little bit from perhaps what we have observed in previous quarters and there was nothing that came to me in terms of changes during the quarter. One thing we do know is that I think we mentioned this before we haven’t but there was a 6% reduction in France in reimbursement and that kicked in and also there was a reduction in reimbursement in Germany for PSG. But that only affected the private market which is roughly a third of the markets. The two thirds being the government-based hospitals where there was no drop in reimbursement. But maybe, Rob you can add some more flavor, if you wish?
Rob Douglas: Sure. I think there is no evidence of hitting a cliff in Europe at all. We would say the market growth in Europe is probably slow more around where the US has been over the past few years. The uncertainty is not helping, but the business is traveling along quite nicely and that’s pretty steady as you go.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: And I guess my follow-up would be, maybe Brett can you give us a sense on hedge gains; in the quarter it looks like the other line was a little bit bigger and where might that be over the balance of this year if rates stay where they are? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock: So, if you say that where hedge gains recorded; they are through other income in the P&L which was $8.5 million this quarter which is predominantly FX guidance there. That you will see from operating income really we were hurt by currency however we had pretty significant hedging gains this quarter really due to all the strengthening both against the US, but in particular against the Euro over there sort of quarter-to-quarter it was about a 9% increase; so its quite significant and marking those to market goals those hedging gains. If you look at all up for the quarter, the FX was positive on the EPS by about a penny, so it’s pretty much a wash with those gains. Looking forward, if rates stay exactly where they are or where they were at the end of December then you would get more gains through other income, we’re on the hedging because we do mark-to-market. But at the moment, they are even up a little from where they were so there will probably be some minor gains coming through, but it would be largely benign unless we get significant movements in currencies again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: So I guess just back to the commentary on gross margin. So Peter, do you think that the gross margin then is sustainable at closer to 60% or do you think if there is some reason that leaves you to believe that it could fallback down to more of the middle of that range this 58% to 60%?
Peter Farrell: Well Michael, we don’t have a crystal ball to be able to laser beam you know on what gross margins going to be; as you realized it’s a function of geographic mix and Europe was bad a bit relative to the US. That doesn’t help; but on the other hand you know the higher margin products showed the biggest growth. If that continues we’ll be you know the sales and the Bi-Levels in the adaptive servo-ventilator obviously master a pretty good and remain good and that’s been true to the past several quarters. So assuming the mass hold up and assuming the growth holds up in the Bi-Levels, the vents and also the order setting products will be close up to 60; if that doesn’t hold up we might drop a little bit, but I think Brett said you know we’re comfortable with 59 to 60 and that’s a better and as precise as we want to be.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: Can you give us any timing around new platform launches on the flow generator side; I guess S92 or S10?
Peter Farrell: We’re working on those; I don’t know; I’ll throw that to Don Darkin. Normally, we don’t, you know we’ll let you know when we’re launching. So making predictions there is not what we’re normally into, just like we don’t make too many predictions.
Don Darkin: I do but most of the others don’t.
Peter Farrell: Don, do you want to say anything?
Don Darkin: The platform is well underway, but at this point assume that’s where we’re at. You know particularly, the step-up in expenditure on R&D and that’s obviously reflective of a greater push in certain areas. But just like we don’t give guidance, we are not going to tell you when the product is going to launch.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: Yeah I mean, that actually read into my next question, just because we’ve seen R&D even on a constant currency basis we’ve seen some pretty dramatic increases there and I am just wondering kind of where you are spending all the money. I understand, look you are launching new products at a regular intervals etcetera, but the number of new products I guess from an outsider simply doesn’t really seem like its gone up all that dramatically. But yet your R&D is going up a lot. Is there something related to that big study, the SERVE-HF study that you’re running or something else going on there behind the scenes?
Peter Farrell: The SERVE-HF study is sort of a fixed spent. So there has been no acceleration in that. We’re up to around 900 patients out of the total 1260 planned. So that hasn’t been reflected in the increase. It’s mostly ventilation products, that are cheap to produce and also we’ve been making a push on the health informatics and those two areas are really the main geeks; really ventilation and health informatics.
Brett Sandercock: Just as we’ll pay much that the recent acquisitions, BiancaMed, Gruendler etcetera where they’ve got some nice products and so on. We’re continuing our R&D efforts there as well. So that increases as well and that’s effectively R&D that we’ve acquired but that we certainly you know, very excited about and we’re absolutely funding those as well.
Peter Farrell: Yeah, good point.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: And then just one more quick question, did I hear correctly that the currency impact on your EPS was positive a penny, positive $0.01 this quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Correct. The bottom-line that would’ve been 41, but it came in at 42. So, you know, not really immaterial.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Did you call up the Bella Mask, B-E-L-L-A as in Beautiful or the Twilight Movie?
Peter Farrell: Yeah, hi Bella.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, just checking. Peter, not that I want to move you along, but can you talk about CEO succession planning right now?
Peter Farrell: Well, I think, we sort of talked about that last, maybe it was last call, I can’t recall. But we’re using an outside recruiter because we like their template. But there is not, it’s not something that we’re rushing along. You know, I made some comment there about my hope in sort of rather, it wasn’t bland; things are going well and we’re going through a very sort of circumspect evaluation and we have got 3,500 roughly give or take employees. We think a few of those people are qualified to run the organization and we are just going through 360s if you like and looking at peoples’ strengths and where they maybe need their improvement. We are using the outside recruiter to help us with that evaluation; we’ve also have another consultant, McKinsey Partner and we’ve worked with Clem Doherty; I don’t want to give advertisement for Clem’s like minded individual’s consultancy, but he is a good guy and he knows us very, very well, we have been working with him since 2004 and he knows all the senior people. And so we’ve got if you like a person who knows us really, really well and recruiters that are beginning to digging down, getting some granularity and we will get reports back from those guys over the next couple of months then we will look at those reports and we will decide where we go from there. But there is no even an announcement Joanne.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: I am sorry, may be it was in Australian newspapers or somebody picked up that Nick was in queue for this; my am I reading or am I remembering something wrong?
Peter Farrell: I think there was a women from I think it was Australian Financial Review which is one of, I don’t know if there is anybody from the AFR on the line but, they indulge in gross exaggeration where there is always takeout of bids where you know somebody is taking us over and there is a big flurry that goes up into the marketplace and we get calls from bankers wanting to help us out with our settle. Again, that’s just a beat up; there is nothing to that as I told you, we’re going through a proper circumspect evaluation and we will make an announcement sometime in the future. I don't think it will be, it will not be the near future.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets:
 :
Peter Farrell: Well, we as you saw Brett indicated that we've been doing a very aggressive buyback, 4.1 million shares for over a 110 million last quarter, the quarter before that I think if Brett can correct me, 125 million about the same number of shares, 4.5 million. We think that from what we can see we think the stock is incredibly undervalued. You can see with our current results we like this area. We continue to be excited about the future. We are in an area which is, it’s preventative medicine, it improves patients’ quality of life and also reduces healthcare costs. So we are in a, if you like a sweet spot regardless of what happens in the crazy world of sick care, also known as healthcare. So we are in a very good space and we believe that the best value at the moment, we increase the borrowing so we have the flexibility. There's another 14 million shares approved for buyback. We believe that the stock is cheap and we are putting our money where our mouth is. Regarding the balance sheet, our total debt including current and non current together is around $225 million and we have net cash of around $0.5 billion, but most of that's offshore. We are not going to bring it back here at the ridiculous tax rate sort of existing in this country and so we will however make investments leveraging the balance sheet in areas like we did or like we’ve done with say BiancaMed and so. But we’re making some private investments where we think we can, we’re not trying to make money on equity plays, I mean you know invest $3 million and you get 10X and you get $30 million back and you put it on our balance sheet with net cash of nearly half a billion, it’s kind of like so what. So we are doing this in the marketplace to put people in a direction which we think makes sense or we are investing in technology that we think in the future will make sense. So that’s where we are putting out our resources, the buyback and minor investments in people that we think can choose straight and will help us expand the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord. Please proceed.
Jason Mills - Canaccord: Hi, Brett first question is for you. I am certainly not a foreign currency expert. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more granularity there because you did a nice job of giving us some color around the constant currency growth in both SG&A and R&D and saying that revenue and gross margins were not affected by currency. So just looking at the SG&A and R&D based on constant currency growth using your percentage as, it looks like it added about a million and half bucks currency did to the cost. And then you said other income 8.5 million was predominately FX. So I am getting into a higher impact from currency just using what we’ve heard so far in the call. So could you just help me out in getting me to understand a little bit better?
Brett Sandercock:
 :
 :
Jason Mills - Canaccord: Okay, so kind of leads to my next question on gross margin, sort of what the constant currency gross margin would have been, you said initially that you saw minimal impact from FX, but now you are seeing, it seems like you had actually a significant impact. Are you saying pro forma, we are looking at margins, it would have been on last year’s currency levels around 61.5%?
Brett Sandercock: That certainly would have been high. So two things on this, Jason, the first one is my comments were generally on sequential movements in the gross margin which people tend to focus on given how volatile currencies are and so on. So that’s one aspect. The other aspect is the year-on-year margin which if you looked at it kind of down I think was 60.8% last year, 59.7% this quarter. So that’s definitely come down and the big driver of that is basically currency on that. So if you basically, you strip that out on constant currency basis, it is suffice to say that margins would have been higher than they are, than they were last year even. Fortunately we are live in the world where it is kind of really volatile at the moment. So we get a lot of these movements happening. You can see the weaker euro even now is going to play a part as well and end up being a bit of a headwind for us. So, there is a whole bunch of factors playing it on that margin, making it pretty difficult to predict.
Jason Mills - Canaccord: Is it possible that you have the mirror reversed in the currency markets happen at some point in time?
Brett Sandercock: In terms of potentially weakening Aussie and so on.
Jason Mills - Canaccord: Yeah, and then you would have gross margins that show up in the 200 basis points lower and is a negative impact. Is that possible or do you feel like?
Peter Farrell:
 :
Jason Mills - Canaccord: Okay, and Peter, on the product mix of flow versus mask, you have consistently proven your mask growth is sustainably strong, what can you do to couple overtime your flow generator growth with that strong mask growth, I presume you don’t have any inclination of that coupling with mask growth coming down. So, I presume that you’re gearing up for flow generators to come up and exist at a higher level, sort of similar to your mask. I am just wondering what sort of initiatives or plan strategy you have in place for that?
Peter Farrell: Well, the one possibility that we’re looking at, given the replenishment area and given the growth in masks, as you pointed out, it’s been strong, traditionally strong. We’ve seen a weakening in the flow generator space and now with HST coming in, I have mentioned that the positive impact on APAP or our autosetting products and also the growth in application of the Adaptive Servo-ventilation. In the last call, I mentioned some of the good things that were happening in Japan where Adaptive Servo-ventilation was being used on heart failure patients even though they didn’t have frank sleep disorder breathing. The cardiologists there and we are involved in a continuing study there. The cardiologists there believe that because of the impact on fluid in the lungs and fluid in the pleura that Adaptive Servo-ventilation should be used for all heart failure patients. That’s pretty encouraging and we’d like to see that spread, but one thing we are looking at and Don can talk to this if he wants to add some flavor to it, but the replenishment area is showing very, very encouraging growth and we have been saying to ourselves, Gee you know what, what about flow generators in that space. So it’s a huge number of very old flow generators. It is kind of like the old Volvo ads. We have been driving this thing for years and years and years. Well guess what, horsepower has changed, acceleration has changed in the newer ones, wouldn’t you like to buy a new one and hey why don’t you trade in your old one. So we seen and quiet frequently patients that will come in with a flow generator and a CPAP device that is over ten years old. With hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours on it. Well Gee you know things like noise, impedance, the algorithms I mean everything has evolved and obviously we make pretty good products because they last a long time, but they have been significant improvements particularly in people that have, and we sort of suggest a lifetime of five years. So there's a lot of devices that are out there that are well over five years old and like I can’t give you the numbers but its in the millions of devices that are out there, how many are older than five years, we can provide some estimates, that looks like half of them. So there's no reason why we could alert people to the fact that they might benefit from a newer device with better compliance and certainly we would think better quality of life. So that's something we are looking at.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I will just have a rather quick one in regards to the European mix of flow gen business. Can you talk about whether the European mix is similar to the US in terms of flow in CPAP orders that's been viable given that the current level in CPAP what you see in the future?
Peter Farrell: That's quite a different mix. Generally Europe is much more a higher mix on the CPAP. Typically the older sets are a lot stronger and the US has a model where patients who don't live well with the CPAP end up on a Bi-Level device and that's not immobile in most European countries. So the mix is very different.
Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just one follow-up question, Peter you talked about obviously home sleep testing and we've still got this issue of PSG labs not yet participating in HST. When do you see that coming, is it now that we've got pre authorization that you will get that potential transferences of PSG labs participating in HST and ultimately what’s the conservative argument, you mentioned that some in ResMed are more conservative than yourself, I am just curious if you can flush out and any other kind of things for us.
Peter Farrell: Okay. Matt let me take your last question there. You can say that I am optimistic but in looking at the terrain, I think we’re going to see a doubling in HST, which means the potential doubling in the America’s in AutoSetting setting devices. So that just my hunch. We’re seeing there is some anecdotal evidence coming back from the marketplace that the payers are getting a little more AMC there, they are saying material expenditure on PSG and they are not -- this authorization is building up a whole ahead of steam. Why? Because it’s going to save them money and you are looking at rough figures 1200 bucks plus for PSG versus 250 for HST. But they are other dynamics that are playing here as well and we’re trying to inform the sleep labs and they’ll pass it over and make in a second and need for him to make a comment. But the sleep labs, we did a survey and found out that 30% of patients have a script written to attend the sleep lab for PSG, 30% of the patients time show out. So if your 30% are no shows that’s big number. And we’ve also found that if the sleep lab also offers HST and if you think about HST versus PSG. PSG you get on a six to eight week wait list and you got to bring a duffle bag with all your gear and then they wire you up. And this is for something that a five-year-old child can diagnose. I mean this is something that is very, very simply to do, particularly if you have a history and a physical by a physician who knows what he or she is doing. So you could almost argue, you could go straight from a history and physical. In a lot of cases straight to autosetting treatment because only autosetting will tell you whether you need treatment or not. But that means obviously buying a device. But physicians would have been in this game for while, now 80% of the time which patient needs treatment and will benefit from it. Anyway stepping back from that so you have got labs. Now if they offer both, then it’s a 2% no show which is quite different. Now, if you think of HST, it is a medium. You take the HST, the apnea link in our case home with you. You bring it back the next morning. In two minutes you get a full diagnosis and you immediately satisfied with the CPAP rather than waiting six to eight weeks, perhaps ten weeks before you’re put on treatment. It’s very inefficient to PSG. It’s very expensive by comparison with HST and much, much, much more inconvenient. So you are going to see consumer move there, you are seeing the payers pushing people in that direction. And I think that the labs that don’t offer HST are actually dinosaurs. The fact is that the whole market is moving in that direction. There is no stopping it and those that resisted. I can loose them. So, and I think given the fact that most of them don’t want to end up on the dole or accepting welfare payments. I think they will move and how quickly that will happen, I am saying it’s doubling. It could even get a higher. I don’t think it is going to be any worse than 30% of all sleep testing and HST. Others conservatively within ResMed, the same more like 25%. But that’s still pretty significant 80% growth versus 100%.
Brett Sandercock: But Matthew, to your question there about sleep labs are not participating in HST. They’re actually already are. And they’re participating at the double-digit percentage rate and it varies by geography around the Americas. But if you look in the Northeast and the Southeast particularly where there is very high density of sleep labs, you’re talking 20% to 40% of them all ready sleep centers participating in home sleep testing and some of them actively offering it because they’re saying that the no-show rate for just PSG is about 30% and the no-show rate when you offer both PSG and HST give people choice. Its down to 5%, could be in that 2% to 3% range in some early data. So that no-show rate goes way down. They’re seeing that and the forward-looking sleep centers are already doing this. Even the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is the sort of group that helps govern this group has put together an accreditation program for Home sleep testing. So, it’s now sort of sanction within the sleep center community and they’re all talking about how do we tie in to patient centered medical homes to accountable care organizations. And all this evolution of the payer environment within the US market and how do we make sure sleep changes upon utilization management at those payers to care management or disease management. So that we show that there is an ROI to the insurance company of diagnosing and treating and managing the patients on CPAP, APAP and VPAP products. So that message is there and both across sleep centers and across the sleep medical communities as well as the HMEs and manufacturers like ResMed, we’re partnering up to put that story together and drive home sleep testing as part of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Any comments you can give us on the launch of Stellar 100 and then Peter you mentioned we have some more ventilation products in the pipeline. How should we think about ventilation going forward for you guys?
Peter Farrell: I think Jeff Nelson, if he is still awake, he is in Europe and Geoff you are the guy on the ground there. Stellar has been released in Europe as a 100 mm on 50 would you like to comment on that please Jeff?
Geoff Neilson: Can you hear me?
Peter Farrell: I can hear.
Geoff Neilson: Okay so Stellar 150 has been in the market now for a while. It’s launched throughout Europe and we have also got that with CareFusion distributing into hospitals in US and they have launched that towards the end of last quarter. And Stellar 150 we launched in Europe and that has our automatic therapy called IPAP switches being well received so far. And Stellar 100 and 150 are approved in Japan and we look forward to launching that in the next quarter and the growth rate is to our expectation and CareFusion has been lot of sampling and their sales force is excited and we are getting some interest from the hospitals and they are showing that, but obviously the sales cycle in the hospital is a bit longer than at home care. And that is story with the Stellar 100 and 150 and looking forward we are investing in new platforms to replace our existing platforms that are available in Europe and the timing of that we wouldn't say at the moment, but we are actively investing in that and you can see that by some of our R&D expenditure. And then we are also looking at humidification with Gruendler and we are doing a CPL or controlled product launch in Europe at the moment and we would be looking forward to launching their new humidifier over in about a quarter’s time and before the end of the financial year. So we are excited about what we are doing and the business is growing; it’s growing quickly in the US with some of the HST products and obviously we are looking forward to new products as they come online.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Then a quick one here for Brett, you know how should we think about the medical device tax impact in 2013?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I mean it’s probably going to be interesting one for all medical companies there on that tax that comes through. At the moment, I mean we have a, we got a team together at the moment that's looking at it on the assumption that its going to come through and who knows what might happen. But at the moment, with sort of planning that’s going to come through, what – that Peter and guys might have some color on whether it gets there or not, but at least that’s what we are planning for. And then it’s just a question of who is, how you do that, who you pace with, or who does that kind of thing, I think all that's got to be worked through.
Peter Farrell: I mean, we are expecting the worst on that, but hoping for the best, I mean there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge David, and hopefully it ends up being positive for the whole of the medical device industry.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS. Please proceed.
Dan Hurren - UBS: Well, good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask Peter your comments at the last quarterly result in relation to stopping discounts for the low end CPAPs in the US became such as huge issue after the quarter. Could you just give an update on that?
Peter Farrell: I never mentioned it Dan, if I had known it was going to create such havoc.
Dan Hurren - UBS: Well, Peter could you perhaps just, I mean at the time you’re talking about some of that volume might come back would have fallen in the next quarter; you didn’t know how many of the price sensitive or how many of the buys were price sensitive; can you just talk about how that’s played out over the second quarter?
Peter Farrell: Well, I think you know I was talking about that we were doing a bit of market segmentation etcetera, but look I am going to tell that to make my comment, but basically we had a period where there was a sort of hockey stick thing going on when I mean I am going back a few years now, we decided that we wanted to have a more you know saying in a way of satisfying customers more of you know; if you can get to further, further, further, I mean that’s kind of dreaming a little bit, but you don’t want to have 60% of your sales in the last month. I am just trying to pulling that figure out of the air; I am not saying that that’s a real number. But too much of the business was being pushed towards the end of the quarter. And it creates logistical issues and if you start offering better prices you know appearing as you are desperate at the end of the quarter to make sales. Then that’s going to push everything in the direction of a hockey stick at the end of the quarter and we decided that we did want to, we did want to offer bag and base process and we didn’t want to have this logistical nightmare towards at the end of the quarter and we’ve taken steps to get around it, so Mick, why don’t you, do you have anything to add to that?
Michael Farrell: Well, I mean the only thing I would say that Dan is that, we haven’t changed really anything in how we operate from Q1 to Q2. We operate our business for the long term, looking at long term efficiency and supply chain management for us; our manufacturing facilities, our inventory facilities and for our customer’s inventory facilities and delivery to their patients. What changed from Q1 where we were minus 2% in America’s flow generators to Q2 where we were plus 4% in America’s flow generators wasn’t any fundamental shift and how we did that. We are doing the same thing as we did in Q1 and Q2. What happened was that we have seen a positive impact overtime going out talking to sleep physician by sleep physician, sleep lab by sleep lab, HME by HME, about the benefits of the S9 Bi-Levels to benefits of the VPAP adapt which is now in the S9 platform, the benefit of the VPAP ST and driving the value of those products and leveraging the positive mix shift from S9 Skype up to S9 auto-setting that is linked with HST which is titled to the question. So that is probably mix-shifts have resulted in that six point turnaround from minus two to plus four. It’s nothing to do with any sort of change in long-term. By the way we got the same of operational efficiency in tying with our large customers that we have before and we plan to stick with that going forward.
Dan Hurren - UBS: So I just, I guess in a word, you are saying that the segmentation is progressing as planned and is proven to be successful?
Michael Farrell: Correct. We are doing the Wayne Gretzky skate to where the tuck will be, not where it was and that’s what we have been doing and it seemed to work here in Q2 and we plan to continue to do that.
Peter Farrell: Have you understand the Wayne Gretzky?
Michael Farrell: All the rugby ball…
Peter Farrell: Yeah, where do you think the ball is going to end up basically; if you’re not an ice hockey fan, than we can send you a bit more detail, but we’ll take it offline.
Dan Hurren - UBS: I will check it out on YouTube. Thank you, gents.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: If we could just turn back to the same sort of topics, the Stella sales during the period, I mean, Mick you just commented that you had to turnaround the 6% turnaround. Just how much was ventilation sales contributed to that?
Brett Sandercock: Well, we don’t give granularity on that, David. You know, because once you start, it’s going to be every quarter getting down to granularity and we don’t think makes a heck a lot of sense. I think Geoff put it correctly we were very satisfied with where we are in the sales, both with CareFusion and with our Asia-Pac and European sales. So a good growth and we expect to see that continue.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: And just again on the Bi-Levels and I guess that was an issue going back a few quarters. If you could talk, I mean, Mick you mentioned the marketing of those products and then now in the S9 platform, just can you talk about where sales of Bi-Level devices are now. This is where they were in 12 months ago, given we went through that deep with the product launch?
Michael Farrell: No, David. We’re not going to go, like we’re not going to split out the category between details of VPAP ST versus Stella. We’re not going to go in to the detail split between CPAP, APAP and Bi-Level, other than to say that it was positive material impact of the S9 Bi-Levels, particularly of VPAP adapt and the ST, which is now there sort of high margin, high value for the customer, high value for the insurance provider products and we’re focusing our attention, and marketing and our sales people have their feet on the street with selling the value proposition of ResMed’s high end flow generators and ventilators as well as our algorithm and how essential as part of HST so a combination of many factors have contributed to that sort of positive mix shift that you saw in flow generators in that period.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Sure. Look I am not expecting you to break it out, I just wanted to get a sense as to whether we were sort of back to the same run rate or whether the Bi-Levels is a category offering the same opportunity that they were 12 or 24 months ago?
Michael Farrell: Look I think we have a good opportunity to take share overtime in the Bi-Level category and in the ventilation category and Geoff can talk more about the global ventilation opportunity, but within the Americas in Bi-Levels we got a lot of run rate and we are going to move at it and keep the value proposition selling on a ongoing basis.
Geoff Neilson: And having said that I think last quarter and certainly the quarter before we talked about the non-complaint OSA so if you like the lower margin Bi-Levels VS products we are seeing that the S9 order set has such a good algorithm, you know one sleep physician who is switched exclusively using the S9 order set and he said he has gone from the low 20s in terms of non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level down to more like 5%. So that’s at the low end and we don’t see any big changes there; in other words it’s going to go from the 20% down to perhaps the 5% non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level S.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: And just one follow up, the pricing environment I guess it’s a pretty standard question on these quarterly calls, but could you talk about what you've seen with your ASP and perhaps touch on what the competitive environment been as well?
Geoff Neilson: You know we happily we've seen no unexpected, put it that way, unexpected changes in ASP which is a good thing. But it seems that the other guys are you know not doing anything silly and we certainly have no plans to do anything silly. I mean typically we are not price setup and we intend to keep that philosophy going forward, and I don’t normally comment on that it’s the environment wasn’t particularly surprising.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: The 3% to 5% price decline to the quarter that you've talked about in the past…
Geoff Neilson: Well, that's annualized. That's an annualized figure, the 3% to 5%.
Operator: We are now at the hour mark. So I’ll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.
Peter Farrell: Alright. Well, thanks once again for joining us today and I’ll just reiterate that we continue to be excited about the future prospects for us in the sleep disorder breathing space. We’re in the right space. Its preventive, improves quality of life and also reduces healthcare costs and we look forward to continuing contributions in this space. So thanks guys.
Operator: We thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude your presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2012 ResMed Incorporated earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose.  Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward looking statements such as projections for future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company’s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed’s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company’s website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed’s chairman and chief executive officer. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead sir.
Peter Farrell : Thanks operator, and thanks everybody for joining us. I’ll begin with some summary comments and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, and then we’ll take questions and I might bring some of the other guys in as needed. First, the finance. We finished with what we think is a very solid quarter. Global revenue grew 12% to $315 million, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew by 9% year over year to $169.3 million, and ROW revenue increased by 15% to $145.5 million, which was 7% on a constant currency basis. US GAAP EPS decreased to $0.33 for the quarter, but let me quickly mention this was primarily impacted by forex and Brett will go into that in a little more detail. But it was a significant impact. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, the hybrid EPS was $0.35, which matched First Call’s expectations. In looking at product category performance, let me start first with masks and accessories. The results in this category continue to perform well across the globe, and we continue to take share. The three new mask offerings, the 4X trilogy, the Quattro, the Mirage, and the Swift FX, continue to do very well.  We also just recently launched versions of all of the FX series masks for women, in our Choices for Her program. This popular family of masks, which are lightweight, unobtrusive, and comfortable, offers female-friendly versions of all three categories with fitting and comfort options especially with women in mind. And I believe we are the first company to design a mask simply for female patients.  We also launched the first pediatric mask in the industry, developed specifically for the treatment of sleep disordered breathing in children, in this case age 2 and older. This is not just a scaled-down adult mask. Every feature of the new Pixie was designed to address and improve comfort acceptance with both child and caregiver in mind.  With the new Pixie nasal mask, we now have three options to meet the needs of children with sleep disordered breathing. And, by combining the new Stellar 100 ventilator with the Pixie nasal mask, we now offer an ideal pediatric therapy solution, particularly in either a hospital or institutional care setting. One reason we continue to see strong growth in masks and accessories other than our new products is that even in this very challenging economy there is excellent business in the resupply or replenishment of masks to existing patients, and we are working with our customers, the HMEs, to leverage this significant business opportunity. Now, moving to devices, our global growth in sleep therapy devices was mainly driven by sales of the S9 AutoSet, as well as our adaptive servo ventilation offerings the VPAP Adapt and the AutoSet CS.  Growth in the rest of the flow generator segment was problematic, especially in the low-end products, as was reported for the previous couple of quarters. This continues to be a challenging environment, especially in the Americas, as everybody knows in the medtech space. But on top of that, we had tough comps, and in addition, the Q1 for us, the September quarter, is always a challenge because of France and Germany vacation issues. So it’s a difficult macroeconomic environment, but one of the key reasons for some impact on the top line was that we chose to walk away from business because it was uneconomic. So in other words, we intentionally left significant potential revenue on the top line. We left money on the table, but we think it was the right call. However, while flow generator sales were softer than expected in the Americas, Europe still posted fairly good results.  A few weeks ago, ResMed introduced the S9 AutoSet for Her, within the Choices for Her program. Offering the quiet comfort of the S9, the Easy Breathe motor, and the enhanced AutoSet algorithm, the S9 for Her ensures that the sleep environment for a woman will remain quiet and peaceful.  And in addition, there is the H5i, the humidifier with climate control, which also has been designed with her in mind. It’s also interesting to note that we think the timing on this makes a lot of sense, because the latest statistics show that 40% of the newly diagnosed sleep patients are actually women.  This quarter, we’ve also taken the initiative to engage existing patients through personalization of CPAP devices. And in this case, we have an exclusive agreement with a company called Skinit, that literally makes skins for various devices, iPods, cellphones, and so on.  Skins represent a unique way to personalize a device, to get SDB patients more intimately connected with their machine, which we hope, or anticipate, may even help to drive compliance. Skins may also create a way to help patients reconnect with therapy and potentially bring them back to treatment if they’re being non-compliant.  Therapy adherence not only drives patient health, which is the primary goal, it is also a good business, as it provides an accessories revenue stream for the HME and may also provide consumer pull for ResMed products. And thus far, even though we’re only a couple of weeks into the skins program, or the Skinit initiative, thus far physicians and HMEs both are incredibly enthusiastic for the product. In short, with S9 products for her, Skinit, and Pixie, we continue to address the needs of a wide range of patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. Now let me switch to ventilation. Sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow progressively in Europe and parts of Asia, but as people would understand, it takes time to launch a new product. But Stella is meeting our expectations. We recently highlighted the Stella 150 with iVAPS at the European Respiratory Society meeting in September and we’ll launch it globally around the end of this calendar year. And both these products will also be launched in Asia. Our first sales will be in December, for the 150, and then later, early in the calendar, 2012, we will be releasing the Stella 100. Of note, the Stella 150 includes, as I mentioned, iVAPS, which is our new automatic bi-level mode. The success of the Stella is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development, and we’re very satisfied with the way it’s been received.  And if people would be aware, we have signed an agreement with CareFusion. Their team went through training in late September, and we’ve had feedback that they’re fairly enthusiastic about the Stella products. As announced in August, we also acquired Greundler Medical GmbH, a German developer and distributor of humidification products, and we are delighted with the acquisition. The integration is going well, and we just launched the latest product, the HumiCare D900, also at the ERS in September. This product has additional innovations in terms of its ability to produce high levels of ventilation in a quick timeframe. There is considerable excitement around this product, and we are fairly optimistic. It also nicely positions us in the hospital environment, and we are now looking at distribution channels and how we might integrate them to make this product available worldwide. A controlled product release is planned for this product, HumiCare D900, later this quarter. Another small acquisition was BiancaMed. The integration there is going well, and we met with a large consumer products company in Japan last week and the technology from the BiancaMed product called the SleepMinder will be launched as part of a wellness program and in fact it’s not just a Japanese consumer products company that is well known, but also an extremely well known U.S. consumer product brand. That will happen towards the end of this calendar year and early in 2012. On the home sleep testing front, in the Americas, commercial payers continue to steer HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attendant PSG or polysomnography. In short, HST is being encouraged, and the momentum continues with major payers steering providers to this diagnostic procedure. We are now beginning to see trends where payers are moving towards utilization management of positive airway pressure devices as a result of removing diagnostic barriers. We see a continuing uptick in the adoption of HST. Let me also add some final flavor. I had mentioned being in Japan last week. I was actually at the World Sleep Congress, and was delighted to see that Japanese cardiologists and endocrinologists are embracing sleep disordered breathing to the extent that they are actually integrating sleep diagnostics into their practices.  Given the prevalence of SDB in cardiac disease and Type II diabetes mellitus, this seems to make a lot of practical sense, and it will be interesting to see if this is adopted by other countries, particularly the U.S., Germany, and France. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Brett, who can provide additional detail on the financials, and then we’ll take your questions. Brett? 
Brett Sandercock: Thanks Peter. As Peter mentioned, revenue for the September quarter was $314.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Currency movements added approximately $10.6 million to our Q1 revenues, so in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%. Income from operations for the quarter was $60.9 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $50.5 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior year quarter.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.33, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, unfavorable currency movements reduced the September quarter’s EPS by approximately $0.08. If currency rates had remained consistent with the prior year, earnings per share would have increased by approximately 14%. Gross margin for the September quarter was 58.8%, up sequentially from Q4 FY11. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from improvements in manufacturing and logistics costs and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Looking forward, for the balance of FY12, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60%, subject of course to currency movements. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product cost through supply chain efficiencies, product design, and manufacturing improvements. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $94.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 29.9% compared to the year ago figure of 30.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012. R&D expenses for the quarter were $26.2 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 18%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.3% compared to the year ago figure of 7%. Again, looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012. This reflects both the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline. As a result of several acquisitions this quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.8 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 25.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 24%. Turning now to revenue in more detail, overall sales in the Americas were $169.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $145.5 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, with currency movements having a positive impact on revenues. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 7% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $72.3 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter. Our growth this quarter was adversely impacted by negative growth experienced in our lower-end CPAP segment.  Masks and other sales were $97 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our portfolio of masks and continued growth in accessories. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $98.7 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $46.8 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1% while masks and others increased by 17%.  Cash flow from operations was a record $89.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.9 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $20.4 million.  During the quarter, we completed two previously announced acquisitions, BiancaMed Limited, a leading Irish medical technology company, and Greundler, a specialist medical humidifier company located in Germany. The integration of these acquisitions is progressing well and to plan. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 4.35 million shares for consideration of $124.7 million. And just to put that into perspective, that represents almost 90% of the volume of shares we repurchased in our previous full fiscal year. At the end of September, we had approximately 18.1 million share remaining under our authorized buyback program.  Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $476 million, while at September 30, assets stood at $1.9 billion, and net equity was $1.5 billion. I’ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions.] And your first question today comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Merrill Lynch. 
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch: Just a quick question in regard to the growth rate. I think it’s going to be the focus of today’s results given the slowdown you’ve seen on the low end. Can you talk to whether that growth rate of 7% that you spoke to last quarter has changed, and if so, try and split that out between the U.S. and Europe in terms of industry growth rates before you move on to the individual product segments. 
Peter Farrell: Matt, the 7% figure, 6-8%, we think is still the right number. We’re kind of optimistic that maybe we’ll see an increase as we go forward. There’s no guarantee there, but we think that that was about what it was for the quarter just finished. Europe may be a tad higher than that, 9-10%, so 6-8% and 9-10%, or let’s say ROW. And I think those numbers are the right ones. The low-end, again, just to reiterate, we walked away from some business. We could have increased the number of flow gens, but we looked at it and said, that’s not business that we really think would satisfy our shareholders. So we did leave revenues on the table, but not much money, if you like. So our numbers don’t really reflect the growth rate in that sense, at the fixed CPAP level in the U.S. And as you saw in ROW, the growth rate was pretty reasonable with the flow gens. We see possible that that number will increase. In the lap of the gods, but we are reasonably optimistic. 
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch: Thanks Peter. I guess breaking down into kind of the basic CPAP, then APAP, then bi-level, putting APAP to one side, it seems to be trucking along nicely, can you talk to what is the factor that is driving that low-end CPAP business. You talked about walking away from some of the potential revenue you could have generated there. Your gross margin’s stronger than I think most of us expected, so what was it that drove you to kind of walk away from that business. Was it that it represented an unsustainable margin, so you didn’t want to get into that game of maybe a lower ASP? Was it that the actual underlying patient, with the copay issue, wasn’t willing to step up, and that was affecting ASP? Can you just give us some more color? 
Peter Farrell: I think the equation is a complicated one, and we’re not sure if loss of COBRA and copays, and all that sort of thing, has an impact. But we’re seeing very nice growth in the APAP space, so there are still people out there going onto treatment, and there are certainly, with the push by the payers and the HMEs feeling more comfortable driving HST, there’s no question that there is a significant jump, and if you go back last year versus the year before, it’s gone from about 4% to 10%, and our latest figures - and again they’re a little rubbery - is that 20% of the patients going on to treatment are actually from home sleep testing, HST.  So there’s no question that that’s increasing. Therefore, that will impact obviously fixed CPAP. There is business in the fixed CPAP area, because let’s face it, if you’re a DME, you’re an HME, you’re not going on treatment, and you’re getting a fixed amount of money, and if you’re not looking appropriately at the business in terms of replenishment, and looking at issues such as compliance, there’s no point in putting a patient onto a device and then having them become noncompliant. Because that way their health is impacted. The insurance company loses. We lose. And so does the HME, DME, because they don’t get the benefit of the replenishment. The annuity which goes with patients who remain compliant.  So our pitch is look, don’t buy cheap, because in fact it doesn’t make economic sense, let alone sense in terms of patient health. But there’s no question that there’s an economic malaise in this place. Everybody’s aware of that. I don’t want to get into a political discussion here. I’ll try to avoid that. But things could be better, put it that way. And I think they will improve in time. But we’re happy with that 7% figure, and the reason we walked away from that business is it was just uneconomic. I mean, you’re always tempted to make deals, but once you start on that slippery slope, there’s no getting off it. 
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch: I guess the second part of that question, which was the bi-levels, can you talk to whether your bi-level share is still recovering? 
Peter Farrell: Yeah, we’re really chuffed, as it were, by the growth in adaptive servo ventilation, because we went from the S7, which was really looking like a car battery to some people I guess. But to put that technology into the S9 was obviously a boon. The same is true of the bi-levels. And we are significantly into the double digits in the bi-levels, and in fact we are where we expected to be, or hoped to be, with bi-level sales.  However, at the low end, as I mentioned last quarter, we’re seeing some loss of bi-level S business, that is the noncompliant OSA, because frankly the S9 AutoSet is so good that - and I was with a guy on the weekend, we had a ResMed Foundation board meeting, and one of the physicians who’s on that board was telling me again that he’s gone from something like 20-25% noncompliant CPAP on the bi-levels down to close to 5%. So I don’t know how representative - that’s [n=1]. He also told me that because of the performance of the S9 AutoSet he reckons everybody should be on an S9 AutoSet, and mind you we’re on the same page there. So do we. But he was saying that his use of wake drugs like Provigil, NeuroVigil, and so forth, has also dropped significantly.  In other words, he’s not seeing as many sleepy patients, and he’s not seeing as many noncompliant patients. I suspect that’s true across the board. We don’t know that for sure, but I think that’s also impacting that. But again, overall, the bi-level market, we’re into double-digit growth, and we’re quite happy with where we’re positioned. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. 
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Following up on that question, if you talk about walking away from business, what’s the effect of that? Somebody’s obviously coming in and taking that business, so how do you turn that around? Or do you end up conceding that low-end segment of the market increasingly over time? 
Peter Farrell: Well, Ben, it’s the sort of thing you’re faced with at the end of a quarter, and how much do you want to bend over. Now, if I’m a DME or an HME, and we’ve done a little bit of market segmentation and we’ve looked at our customers, and the ones that tend to come in by saying, hey, listen, we’ll buy a certain amount from you, but here’s the price, they tend to be less driven by the patient concerns, if you like. I’m not saying they’re completely irrelevant to them, but it’s more on the basis, of hey, I’m getting paid x for a machine and I’m prepared to pay you y, what do you think? And do we do deals? Yes we do. Everybody in the business does deals, but there are some deals that you just simply say, no, that doesn’t work for us. Now, this thing does vary quarter to quarter. I think we can get some of that business back, and we’ll still continue to sell to those people, but we’re not that concerned about it. We prefer to sell on quality and performance and we’re happy with that space that we’re in. 
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Is this at all similar to the situation four years ago where Respironics sort of cut price in a material way so they undercut the typical delta, maybe 10% between your product and theirs, and that delta became 15 or whatever, and you eventually had to sort of take a step function change?
Peter Farrell: You know, it’s not at a level as it was four years ago. It’s not quite at that level. And it’s not across the board. That was more of a global thing. This is more of selected customers in selected areas, if you know what I mean.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. And then finally, if you try to build up underlying patient volume growth, and then maybe mix in price for us to get to that market growth, how would you think about those three pieces? 
Peter Farrell: That’s a bit complicated. Don’t jump off the call. [Laughter] We’re saying the revenue growth is around 7% in the U.S. market, and it’s a little higher than that, maybe 9% ROW. Now, we believe that within the U.S. market there’s going to be a continuing trend. I mentioned the figure of 20%. That’s where we think it is now, 20% of all patients going on to treatment are now in the HST space. So we’re optimistic about growth in APAP in the auto set. And we still think it’s going to be soft in the fixed CPAP. It will still be around, because a lot of the guys out there, there’s a certain segment that just buy on price. There are plenty of others who buy on how well is the patient going to do and we’re satisfied they’re going to remain compliant. But it’s very hard. Can you just give me a bit more understanding of your question? 
Ben Andrew - William Blair: I’m trying to get to that revenue growth number of 7%. Are you talking about patient growth of 7%, mix of 10%, and price minus 10%? 
Peter Farrell: It’s hard to know. I’ll go with the 7% revenue and I think you’re probably a little bit ahead of that with patient growth, but we have factored in, and always have for the last x years, that we expect a 5% across-the-board hit in price. It’s not far off that, frankly. 
Brett Sandercock: It’s just a little bit more complicated, with HST and with APAP and so on, that trend we’re seeing there that’s probably been with us for a few years. Yet you go back a long time and volume would generally be higher than revenue. So it’s more complex now with this sort of trend with inflow gens it seems to be heading toward higher end as well, at least how we see it. But Peter’s right, in terms of ASP declines it’s traditionally been around that mid-single digits. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Clair of Piper Jaffray.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: I guess the first question is maybe we can just talk about kind of trends in the quarter. Is it something that just really continued to decline throughout the quarter, or get slower throughout the quarter? Or was it just kind of a steady lower growth throughout the quarter? 
Peter Farrell: No, we’re not selling direct to consumers, so we don’t have total visibility. Let me say again about ROW that since our second and third biggest markets are Germany and France, there is always a predictable softness in the first quarter because August is your vacation month and basically labs shut down and physicians take off and let’s face it this is not a heart attack, it’s an elective procedure, and you’re not likely to be putting the patient at risk of losing their life. At least not in a high-risk sort of way. So there is that softness there. So that can explain the ROW numbers, because of the size of the German and French revenues in our mix. As far as the U.S. goes, as we said we’re seeing this trend with adoption of HST across the board and we expect that to continue. With respect to growth, generally in the quarter, the last month is always bigger than the first month, and so it’s very hard to tease out growth rates. It starts slow and finishes pretty quickly. And we’ve seen that for years. We try to get away from that. It would be nice to have a third, a third, a third, but that’s just not the way the system works. And often, at the end of the quarter, there’s not exactly a hockey stick, but there is substantially more product sold in the last month compared to the first month. And that trend, we’d prefer it to be different, but that’s just the way the system is. That seems to be the way HMEs and the DMEs buy. They stock up at the end of the quarter, start slow, and then run out of inventory and start buying again. And that’s the cycle. 
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: And just to go back to that comment that you walked away from a little bit of business in the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of, is this something that’s fairly common or has it kind of picked up this quarter or last quarter? Any commentary you can give there? 
Peter Farrell: Maybe Brett, I’ll throw you under the bus on this one. But let me just make a comment. There are a couple of deals this quarter just finished that were unusual to me. And there’s always deals at the end of a quarter, but if it becomes too crazy, we just say, fine, good luck, and have a nice rest of your life. But Brett, do you want to comment any further?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, it’s just in that commercial environment you get potential deals or opportunistic things that come up and what you’ve just got to do is you’ve got to look at those and you’ve got to balance that against what you’re looking at doing in the longer term as well, rather than trying to get yourself into sort of a 90-day mentality, is to really look at that and look at the sustainability of the business and where the trends are and just look at it on its merits, and then I think it’s a judgment call on what you’re prepared to do and what pricing you’re prepared to take. 
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and that 7% market growth figure that you guys gave, can you split that into flow gens and masks? What you think the overall markets are growing there? 
Peter Farrell: Well, we haven’t actually tried to get granularity there, and it would be difficult to do. But if I had to take a guess, the flow gens are under 7%, a shade under, and the masks would be a shade over. Put it this way, it’s an easy call to make, because trailing revenues, the machine give or take is a 5-year project, whereas a mask is a 3-6 month project. So since you’ve got a fairly big base of patients out there that are being resupplied, you’re always going to see much faster growth, or higher growth, with the accessories and masks. And that’s just the way it is. You might replace your machine every 5 years. 
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: And then Brett, what’s the manufacturing in Singapore now? What percent. 
Brett Sandercock: We’re pretty consistently ticking up, and around a third of our production on a blended basis would be in Singapore now. And again, we expect that to increase over the course of the year as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: First of all, just wondering if you could quantify the impact of currency on your earnings per share in the quarter. 
Peter Farrell: I’ll throw that to you, Brett. I thought Brett had handled that, Michael. 
Brett Sandercock: That’s okay. Michael, it was $0.08 negative. 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: And what was it last quarter, two cents negative? 
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I think from memory it was two or three cents. 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: And I guess I was just wondering what your views are on the Respironics ROIQ product. It seems sort of an interesting strategy. It’s unclear how well it will do, but I guess I’m a little worried that it could kind of derail the full autosetting market by offering a lower-end product that has some of the benefits of autosetting, at least in the home testing arena. 
Peter Farrell: You know, I hesitate to say smoke and mirrors, but I might say that if I were asked. I’ll throw it to Don. Would you like to comment on that Don? 
Don Darkin: Yeah. We’re watching this obviously closely. It’s an interesting play, but again, when you think about how the HST space is going to unfold, we think it will be an interesting commercial move at the lower end, but I just don’t see at this point the big impact that they’re hoping for. We’ll follow it through and measure it as it goes, but at this point I’m not seeing it as a big deal.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: Okay. And then can you disclose what you paid for BiancaMed and the other acquisition that you did in the quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Our 10-Q will be out in a little while, which will show that as an aggregate amount for all those acquisitions. 
Peter Farrell: We didn’t bet the farm, if you like. They were fairly small. Together they were well under $50 million, put it that way. 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: And can you walk through the timing on the BiancaMed product launch again? 
Peter Farrell: Well, we bought BiancaMed because we were working with them. We initially invested in them. We had 12% of them back in 2003, and we’ve kept at that 12% level until we finally pulled the trigger and bought them. There was a VC who was interested, and they basically wanted us out of the front row. Obviously if you’re a VC you want as best you can get at an auction. And they didn’t want us getting any sort of special treatment.  We had been working with BiancaMed with a Chinese Wall if you like, and as you know two of the areas we’re interested in are COPD and cardiovascular disease, and in this case, specifically, congestive heart failure. So we were developing algorithms in COPD for acute exacerbations and in CHF space for acute decompensation. Now given the cost of putting a CHF patient or COPD patient in the hospital, it’s tens of thousands of dollars, and the algorithm we’re working on is to give us forewarning, if you like, of respiratory disturbances, decompensation in the case of heart failure, and exacerbations in the case of COPD. And we really wanted to make sure we owned that technology.  So that was the real reason for buying when we did, because the VC was about to pull the trigger. Now, having said that, when we did a more of a deep dive we found that they were getting into the consumer space, and in fact there are considerable discussions with four major players in the consumer space. And they’re extremely well-known names, which I’m not at liberty to mention now. We’ve already sold some devices to one of these, and it’s a Japanese company. And there’s another Japanese company that’s expressing an interest, and there are two fairly big U.S. companies that are expressing interest.  We thought that this was really kind of an interesting potential and the more we heard about it the more we liked it. And it positions us in a quite different space, and I guess where we’d like to be is that if you get on the net and put in “sleep apnea” or “sleep disordered breathing” ResMed pops up and starts flashing at you. We’re not at that point yet, but it would be nice to think of that as a possibility. 
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities: Okay, just one follow up on BiancaMed and then I’ll be done. So the revenue opportunity with this acquisition, is it in this consumer element of the business? Or is it more back end loaded in some of the more longer-term medically oriented products that they’re developing? 
Peter Farrell: Well, you know, it’s very hard to predict consumer items. They can take off. If you look at iPads, iPods, everybody wants one, and bingo, the stores are all jammed with people. The play in all these spaces is wellness, and it’s wellness connected with whatever else the company’s pitching. And wellness now, it’s not just nutrition, it’s not just physical fitness, it’s sleep. And so people are waking up to sleep, and these big consumers companies are saying, well, if people are waking up to sleep, we want a piece of that action. I could see either way, Michael. This could take off in the consumer space and we’d be delighted if that were to happen. Our main interest, however, is in COPD and CHF and it’s as an enabling tool. In other words, the COPD patients will be put on our devices and the heart failure patients will be put on our devices, and the means to that is using BiancaMed technology. So that’s the main reason, but gee, if this other stuff happens, we’ll be delighted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS 
Dan Hurren - UBS: Just want to ask about [unintelligible] masks. You’ve got a couple of masks, the high-performing masks, that are now coming up to the sort of anniversary date. They’re a year old, and the gel mask has only been out there two years. Can you talk about the growth profile of those masks? And should we expect an annualization and a drop-off from those? 
Peter Farrell: Good question, Dan. That’s one for Don. 
Don Darkin: Right now we’re not seeing anything [unintelligible]. In fact most of our mask lines are increasing. We had a lot of mix shift in certain areas, but there’s nothing changed on those products at this point. And they’re actually trucking a little bit higher than we would have budgeted. 
Peter Farrell: I guess Dan to give it a bit more flavor, with the trilogy, the 4X products, we were getting hammered a bit in the nasal mask category, and whilst we’ve always had the drop on everybody in the full face mask and on the pillows, we did see a drop-off in the nasal category and the Mirage FX has really turned that around. But apart from that, Don’s right, it’s always been encouraging, our mask products, the sales and we’re happy as we’ve ever been with the offerings. 
Dan Hurren - UBS: Okay thanks. And just another question. Without wanting to labor the low-end CPAP point, but the business you walked away from, are you talking about a gaggle of smaller customers? Or medium size customers? Or larger customers? Where’s the sort of price pressure come from? What type of customer? 
Peter Farrell: Well, prefer not to go there, but you can probably guess that it’s less the smaller guys and more the bigger guys who can afford to leverage you, or feel they can. 
Dan Hurren - UBS: And just to clarify a point I think I heard before, you’re talking about this kind of pricing done for the rest of financial year ‘12? 
Peter Farrell: No, not necessarily. 
Dan Hurren - UBS: So you think this pricing pressure will be alleviated? 
Peter Farrell: Yeah, look, we’re not seeing any ogres out there in the marketplace. This always comes up. All the time people focus in on pricing. Let’s talk about competitive bidding. That was on the last four or five calls, and in the markets where competitive bidding has been used, we have not seen any material difference in our business. And so price pressures will always be there, and hell, if I’m a guy buying your products, I’m always going to try something on you. Why not? But we generally have been pretty good about saying, look, here’s where we’ll go, and that’s kind of it. And that happened in this quarter a little bit more than what we’re used to, but we don’t see a sign of this being something that’s going to continue for the future. It might, but there’s no real indication that it’s going to continue. 
Dan Hurren - UBS: Yeah, I guess I’m just trying to understand what’s changed. You’re right, you’ve always been very up front about the constant price decline, the 5% price decline you’ve seen. And it’s always been there. I’m just wondering what’s changed this time around. 
Peter Farrell: Well Dan, it’s just a couple of deals at the end of the quarter, and you just say you know what, forget about it. And that was it. We are really delighted with the 58.8% gross margin, given what we thought it could be. Now, we can take that down quite easily and really drive the top line, but that’s not the game we are in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Maybe if we could just switch topics. The buyback, Brett could you perhaps talk about what your plans are there? Because certainly as you said in the lead in comments, you’re well ahead of the historic rate. 
Brett Sandercock: Sure. So on the buyback we have, we did refresh the buyback back in August with a 20 million share buyback program, so we’re working through that. And we’ve still got 18.1 million left there. So I wouldn’t give specific guidance on it, but I think I’d say we’re likely to be more aggressive than we were the previous year in terms of the buyback. And the intention is we’ll work through that authorized buyback. But timing at this stage, I don’t think we can be too specific other than to say that we intend to work through that authorization. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: This recent quarter is our best guide to the rest of the year? 
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, we will buy quite a bit and then I think it’s safe to say we’ll definitely continue to buy back and we’ll certainly buy back the absolute minimum, whatever gets diluted out of the employee comp issues for example, and equity issues. So we’ll do that as a minimum and I think you can see that whilst it might not be 4 million shares a quarter, I certainly think we’ll be buying back more aggressively. We probably averaged about a million per quarter last year and I think you can say I think we’ll be more aggressive than that. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: And just switching to mask sales. I think there was a comment there along the way that mask sales are actually a little bit ahead of your expectations. When I look at device sales growth slowing down, is there any risk that as the install base of ResMed products, the growth rate slows, that that has a read across to the masks and the replenishment programs? 
Peter Farrell: If you look at the bigger picture, and you look at the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing and the various comorbidities, I would see any slowing in the growth as a reflection of the general economic malaise rather than anything to do with sleep disordered breathing. The prevalence in these areas, whether it’s Type II diabetes at 80%, the real question is, and congestive heart failure at 80%, the real question is at what level of AHI apnea hypopnea index do you treat these patients. And as we look at the clinical data that are being developed, it’s very clear that the earlier you treat, the better off you are. So we’re in the prevention space, it’s a great space to be. You save money. We’re putting a lot of emphasis now on health economics in order for us to work with the payers and say look, if you invest in this up front you’re going to save as you go forward. And the returns, the numbers we’re looking at, you get a return within one calendar year. So we’re in such a good space. So you know, it’s easy to look at what’s happening currently in the marketplace, but it’s a blip, I think. This is a very healthy business. We’re glad we’re in it. And it will be interesting to see how the next couple of quarters unfold. I’m not a soothsayer, but we feel reasonably confident where we are. We do. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: I guess asking a related question, we’ve seen mask growth in the U.S. up more than 20% over the last couple of years. And my presumption is that’s on the back of replenishment programs, which has been a fantastic trend, and certainly well ahead of what we had anticipated. My caution is can that be maintained? Is the replenishment opportunity, is the mask per patient opportunity not being closer to being saturated now than it was, and therefore that growth rate at risk of coming back.
Peter Farrell: I’ll just say a word about that, and then Don Darkin can come in if he feels like it. But when we’ve looked at the number of masks that have been sold per patient per year, we are staggered at the potential to do more business. And in other words, when we’ve looked at it it’s been about 25% of the potential. So in other words, there’s a fourfold possibility there just in the current space. Putting it more specifically, patients generally will be reimbursed for a mask every three months, or every four months, depending on who’s paying. And the number of masks per patient per year is closer to one than four. So there’s a lot of potential there. Do you have a more recent figure Don? 
Don Darkin : No, we’ve still got a ways to go, even to come close to a half. I think we’re seeing these increase slowly as we put effort into this. We have our own teams now working on this in education way, both in the business and in patient usage, and we’re seeing it move up slowly. And plenty to go. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: I’m finding that hard to reconcile with the 7% growth that you’re talking about. I mean, given that we’ve seen 20% growth in masks… 
Peter Farrell: Oh no, we’re talking new patients pretty much. 
David Low - Deutsche Bank: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Zable with WJB Capital 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: I know it’s not your typical quarter, but that’s what you guys get for spoiling us for so long I guess. 
Peter Farrell: Well, we’re not unhappy with it Josh. 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: Good. Just a couple of housekeepings and then I sort of want to go back and just hash out one quick thing. So just a couple of housekeepings. First of all, Brett, on your assumptions of the Aussie dollar, I know it’s had a crazy move around. It was at 110 when you gave guidance, just as far as you gave us your expectations for the year, kind of what you’re assuming, because it’s been all over the place. That’s the first housekeeping question. 
Brett Sandercock: Are you asking me for a prediction on the currency? 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: No, no. I’m just asking based on the sort of guidance you gave, what you’re assuming for the Aussie dollar. 
Brett Sandercock: It was around the 102-103 mark for the Aussie against the U.S. 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: Okay great. And then just point of clarification, Peter. I know you talked about the ventilation business in the U.S. Just to be clear, so you have not sold anything in the U.S. yet. That will start sort of end of this year and then into calendar 2012? Just for clarity. 
Peter Farrell: No, we haven’t done material sales. We’ve made sales to CareFusion, and the first few units have gone out. Geoff Neilson is sitting beside me, so maybe he can give you a little bit of flavor of what he expects or hopes for. 
Geoff Neilson: So we’ve just done some initial stocking orders to CareFusion, and they’ve started selling as of earlier this month to institutions. And Stellar 100 is also available to home care providers, but that’s not material. That’s just on a real niche to do with pediatrics or patients that need such a high [unintelligible] product in that segment. 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: And then just Peter, not to beat a dead horse here, I know obviously everybody’s asking about the generator growth. Now that you have the benefit of hindsight of a couple of quarters, generator growth obviously hasn’t been spectacular for the past few quarters. I know we’ve talked about sort of the bi-level kind of being a hole in the product line. Now you’re kind of talking about the low end pricing and walking away from deals, which I think we all appreciate and understand. And you’re also sort of talking about how you don’t expect it to continue going forward. Obviously your competitors have acted irrationally in the past. I guess I’m just trying to reconcile, if I look past, has this been going on and now you’ve kind of started to comp up against it, and so that gives you more confidence that you don’t have it? Or I know this sort of happens at the end of the quarter, so it’s difficult to predict, so while you might not be seeing it today, is there sort of something that gives you confidence that there was something going on there that made them aggressive at the end of this particular quarter that might not happen next quarter? I think everyone’s trying to reconcile exactly what happened this quarter versus the past and maybe why it will be different going forward, or if we should account for that for the next couple of quarters until you sort of comp up against the lower end, you’re going to struggle there. 
Peter Farrell: Well, I think the trends we can have some confidence in - we see the HST to AutoSet just continuing. And it looks like it’s 100% year over year. Does that mean it’s going to be 40% next year? It’s the sort of thing that could really really take off. And the mechanics are, if you’re doing HST, you’re unlikely to be going to fixed CPAP, simply because you’re not bringing the patient in to do a titration. So we’re reasonably confident that the HST is going to go forward at a reasonably quick rate. We can’t guarantee that, but that’s what we’re seeing. And the reason is if you put a patient through a sleep lab, it’s inconvenient, it’s ineffective, and it’s expensive. And if you want to put a number to it, say $6,000, wait a couple of months, versus $2,000, get it done immediately. We also know that there’s 30% attrition for patients that are given a script to go to a sleep lab because of the timeframe and the difficulty in certain parts of the country in getting onto the list. They say, the hell with it, and I’ve got to get a kit bag and I’ve got to go to the lab, etc. So the HST to AutoSet, because of its convenience, cost, and so forth, we see that continuing. Now, as for the sort of “crazy” deals and so forth, we have seen this stuff before. It was just that toward the end of the quarter a couple of these deals came through and we talked about it and said, you know what? We ain’t going to go there. And so that was it. I don’t see this as a big deal. I think it’s just something that’s a try-on, something that happened, that’s just the way the world is. I don’t see it as a trend. 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: Okay, and then just you mentioned HST, and this is my last one, I saw today that the president of the AASM sort of proposed new guidelines for out-of-center testing. I wasn’t sure if you’d got a chance to look at that. 
Peter Farrell: No, I haven’t seen that Josh.
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: Okay, just wondering if there was anything sort of changing there. I’ll go back and bug you about it later.
Peter Farrell: By all means. Email, etc. But I haven’t seen the AASM. But it’s not a surprise. They’ve understood that this is happening, and they want to be able to be in the catbird seat I guess, and they see themselves as the protector of the realm, and they would like to see that they are setting the standards. I assume that’s it. It’s going to be a big ask for them, unless everybody who diagnoses patients has to be a boarded sleep member, I think they’re going to have trouble doing what they want to do. But I don’t blame them. Certainly it’s not unexpected. I knew it was in the hopper, but they were developing standards - they don’t call it home sleep testing, they call it out-of-lab testing. I won’t comment further on that. 
Joshua Zable - WJB Capital: They’re trying to rile you up, you know. 
Peter Farrell: And they’re having some success. [Laughter]
Operator: I’d like to thank our analysts today for participating in the question and answer portion of today’s call. We are now at the one hour mark, so I’d like to turn the call back over to Dr. Farrell for his final remarks. 
Peter Farrell: All right. Well, I think we’ve had plenty of remarks. And I’d like to thank everybody for being on the call and thank all the ResMed people for working so hard. And with that, I’ll close the proceedings. Thanks all.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keisha, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new market for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.  With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Ferrell, please go ahead, sir.
Peter Farrell: Thank you very much, Keisha. Good afternoon. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin with a summary on the quarter and talk about -- briefly about acquisitions and the recent partnership announcement. And I'll then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, who as you know is our CFO. And Brett will go through the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take questions. And most members of the senior management team are also with us today and I might -- in fact, I'll very likely call on them in to get involved in some of the question -- some of the answers to your questions.  First, the financial summary. We finished what we would describe as a very solid quarter and another excellent year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011, the final quarter, grew 17% to $342 million or up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew a very solid 14% year-over-year to $183 million, while the rest of the world revenue increased by 22% or in constant currency terms, 8% to $159 million. GAAP EPS increased 9% to $0.37 for the quarter. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was $0.39.  In discussing product category performance, let me start with Masks and accessories as the results in this category were extremely encouraging. We've now exceeded over $0.5 billion in annual Masks sales alone. We believe we're hitting home runs on all the value propositions for the decision makers in our channel. We have a suite of products, in particular, the recent Quattro FX or let me say the FX series, the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX, which meet the market needs all the way from the lab to the patient. Our Masks are effective, easy to fit, comfortable and more value for money. And they require less callbacks and ensure more compliance. In fact, on Tuesday, I was visiting a sleep position in Oklahoma City where the temperature -- beautiful day, the temperature hit about 114 degrees. But Jonathan Schwartz's lab, he has 24 beds, and he was waxing lyrical almost about the Mirage FX, which he said fits virtually all patients immediately.  Turning to flow generators. Our global growth in sleep therapy devices was once again driven strongly by sales of our S9 order set. Preference for this product continues to increase globally, and the order set has become a consistent source of our growth. We believe the increase in home sleep testing is and will continue to fuel sales of the order set. As expected, the addition of the bilevels on the S9 platform has arrested the decline in overall device sales in the Americas, and sales of the new S9 bilevels are doing very well and are ramping to our expectations.  Adding to flow generator performance was the recent launch in Europe of the Stellar 100, which is an adult and pediatric ventilator designed for both noninvasive and invasive use. Sales of Stellar have been growing progressively each month as we've launched country by country in Europe and parts of Asia. As we've always maintained, it takes time to launch any new product, but it is certainly ramping to our expectations. And the Stellar 150, where we will launch globally in fiscal Q2, that is the final quarter of this year, calendar 2011, this product includes what's known as IPAPs, our new automatic bilevel mode, which is automatic in both expiration and inspiration. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our progress in product development.  In addition to our success in internal development, we are pleased with the progress we are making in building strategic partnerships or relationships. And let me comment briefly on CareFusion, Gründler, which was just announced of course, and BiancaMed. Just over a week ago, we announced a 5-year exclusive distribution agreement with CareFusion to market our ventilation products in hospitals, long-term acute facilities or acute-care, I should say, facilities and skilled nursing facilities. The initial focus will be on the launch of the Stellar 100 and related products, and the Stellar is an excellent fit in the CareFusion ventilation platform as it provides them with the product facilities' differentiated features and a more competitive price point. It also allows us to quickly enter the institutional healthcare pressure support ventilation marketplace. According to -- in Medicare's February 2011 report, the Americas sub-acute noninvasive pressure support ventilation market is the fastest-growing segment, estimated to be, albeit sub-$100 million, but it's growing at more than 6% annually.  As we announced today along with our results, we acquired Gründler Medical GmbH from Freudenstadt in Germany. Gründler is obviously a German-based company, developing innovative medical humidification products. These humidifiers fit a wide range of ventilators from neonatal and pediatric to noninvasive pressure support to the intensive care unit. The strategic implications of this deal are that it enables us to provide a system sale with existing and future ventilators into the home -- into both the home and the hospital markets. In short, it's a one-stop shop for humidification. It will provide incremental revenue as we enter into a new market segment, allowing us to build our expertise, as well as allow us to build a competitive position in humidification, which we have never really had. And we'll be able to leverage the humidification technology between both ventilation and the sleep-disordered breathing space. We have known the founders of Gründler for several years and are looking forward to having them join the ResMed team, and I might parenthetically add that 2 of the senior people in Gründler are both physicians. So that will add to our medical support team.  Also, just a few weeks ago, we announced that we had acquired BiancaMed, a leading, high technology, Irish company. BiancaMed, we've had an association with them from -- which goes back to 2003 when we initially invested in them. So we know them very, very well. And again, the acquisition of BiancaMed brings in 2 very, very qualified engineers. They're Conor Hanley and Conor Heneghan. Conor Hanley has a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Pen [Pennsylvania], and Conor Hannigan has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia. They're both very talented people, and again, we see them helping us beyond the BiancaMed acquisition.  However, BiancaMed itself has developed and is marketing an innovative, convenient, noncontact device to one of the sleep and breathing in the home and hospital. BiancaMed's SleepMinder is an accurate, touchfree device that measures sleep and breathing with sophisticated biometric software, also using Doppler. The core of BiancaMed's proprietary technology is a motion sensor that can detect respiration and movement without physical contact with the body. The company is developing a number of other applications for this technology across a wide range of medical and consumer settings, and we'll have more to say later about the consumer aspects of it. But we're actually quite excited about that. BiancaMed will become a part of ResMed's newly created Ventures and Initiatives unit, which will now be run by Jim Hollingshead. There may be questions on that, and we're happy to talk about it.  With each of these transactions, the CareFusion, the Gründler and BiancaMed, we're adding external expertise in strategically important areas. And although they are not yet material contributors to our short-term financial results, we're very confident they'll add value in the years to come.  On the home testing front in the Americas, interest in HST continues to evolve. HST increased significantly, actually doubling in fiscal 2011. And we now believe it's somewhere in the vicinity of 10%, maybe a little more of sleep test volumes. And we'll continue to expand due to patient convenience and commercial pairs pushing HST, although that push has not yet been broadly enforced. And many of you probably saw the recent announcement by United Healthcare in which United is now requiring prior authorization for attended polysomnography and encouraging the use of HST. This is early days, and a recent external report suggested that maybe the tipping point could be 18 months to 2 years away. One doesn't know about that, but we are seeing a definite and increasing interest in HST. Why? Because it's far more effective. It's far more efficient. It's done immediately, and it's certainly far less expensive, probably over all about 1/3 the cost of going through PSG and pressure setting in the lab. So we see this continuing, and we see it being driven primarily by the insurers.  We also expect growth to result from continued and improved awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep-disordered breathing plays in the very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, namely cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes, as well as, of course, obesity, which hits just about all the bases anyway. Increasingly, there is evidence coming to light that early intervention in the treatment of sleep-disorder breathing will not only slow or prevent the progression of these co-morbidities, it actually treats the co-morbidities. And we're very, very excited about this data, although very early days, of course. In fact, just last month, the American Heart Association published new research demonstrating that LSA can cause changes in blood vessel function in the endothelium that reduces blood supply to the heart in people who are otherwise quite healthy. The research showed that treatment with 26 weeks of CPAP improved study participants' blood supply but also a function of the blood vessels. This adds to other smaller studies showing blood vessel abnormalities in untreated sleep-disordered breathing patients. On that note, I'm happy to report that the 800 patients -- 800th patient has been enrolled in our survey chip study, which of course is being conducted in Europe, mainly Germany, and to a lesser extent, France.   Now I'll turn the call over to Brett, who can provide some additional detail on the financials, and then we'll attempt to take care of your questions. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the June quarter, as Peter mentioned, were $341.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $17.8 million to our Q4 revenue. So in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Income from operations for the quarter were $66.7 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $58.5 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.37, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. And excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.39.  Gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, broadly consistent with Q3 FY '11. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, offset by ASP declined and an unfavorable geographic mix. Currency impacts on a sequential basis were relatively neutral this quarter.  Looking forward in Q1 FY '12, the appreciation of the Australian dollar will negatively impact our gross margin by around 100 basis points. However, assuming there's no other currency movements, we expect initiatives targeted at reducing product costs to its supply chain efficiencies and manufacturing improvements, together with a favorable product mix trend, should lead to an improvement in gross margin in the second half of FY '12 compared to the first half of FY '12.  SG&A expenses for the quarter were $102.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 13%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.9% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.8%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.8%.  Looking forward, and again, subject to currency, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strength of the Australian dollar and also the continued investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.9 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to the year ago quarter effective tax rate of 26.1%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 25.3%, while we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 25%.  Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $182.8 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $159.1 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, with currency movements having a positive impact on revenues. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.  Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generated sales were $82.8 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. As expected, our growth this quarter was positively impacted by the launch of our S9 bilevel platform. Masks and other sales were $100 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions from our FX range of Masks and continued growth in accessories.  For revenue outside the Americas, flow generated sales were $108.4 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $50.7 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generated sales increased by 5%, while Masks and other increased by 20%.  Cash flow from operations was $74.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $17.4 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.5 million. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for consideration of $64 million. For the full year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares for consideration of $160.1 million. As of today, we have approximately 9.3 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $635 million. And at 30 June, total assets stood at $2.1 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion.  I will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.: Yes, I guess just a question regarding the commentary around the gross margins for fiscal 2012. So you're at about 58% for the fourth quarter. So you're seeing that you expect another 100-basis-point decline, but things should get better in the second half of 2012. Does that mean we should be modeling roughly 57% range for at least the next 2 quarters? Am I hearing that correctly or not?
Peter Farrell: Well, Michael, it was actually 58.2%, so that will be aimed to 58.1%. But as you know, it's a complicated equation with geographic mix. And in this particular instance with the very encouraging growth in the U.S. market, which was 14%, where the prices tend to be a little lower, that obviously impacted the figure, but let me throw it to Brett for some more granular input.
Brett Sandercock: Sure. Mike, this is Brett. Yes, I mean, what we want to call out is, we're coming up with some pretty strong headwinds on the currency, particularly the Australian dollar, obviously. So that's going to have quite a big impact. But as Peter said, there's a lot of other factors that play out on the margin, product mix, geographic mix, manufacturing improvements we have in supply chain and so on. So on a sequential basis, in the short term, I think we've definitely got some opportunities there where we'll do better than that. But on far more comprehensive work-through on some of the initiatives we have that, that will start to impact the margin, particularly in the second half. So I'm not saying that some of those won't manifest in the first half. I think some of them will. But certainly, we think that will be stronger in the second half. And it's a pretty significant headwind we're facing just in terms of the Aussie dollar. But as you know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world at the moment, so -- that all the dollar could do anything at the moment. So we're just trying to give you a little more color around that, but rest assured that we're working pretty hard on initiatives to expand that margin.
Michael Matson: Okay. But just to make sure I'm understanding it correctly, you're kind of saying that there'll be 100-basis-point hit, which would be -- that's sort of a baseline, and you're going to try to improve things from there, right?
Brett Sandercock: Correct. Correct.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.: Okay. All right. And then that's off of the fourth quarter level, right? Not the full year 2011 level?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, sequentially from fourth quarter.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.: Okay. All right. And then I just have kind of a high-level strategic question. Given the management changes, given the Venture group that you've established, are you trying to -- it seems like you're trying to further diversify the company. And is -- can I read anything into that about what you're seeing in terms of long-run growth in the sleep apnea market or sleep-disordered breathing market? And in the longer run, do you intend to become sort of a broad respiratory play, more akin to what the old respironics used to be like?
Peter Farrell: Well, Michael, I think a general feeling is that not being in the hospital market, we're sort of leaving money on the table. So that's certainly part of the equation. And if you look at that, we spent quite a bunch of money on R&D in the ventilation spot. Geoff Nelson may want to add some more flavor here, Geoff being the President of the Respiratory Care Strategic Business Unit. But we thought we would just leave the money on the table. And the good news is that outside the United States, we're actually doing not so badly in the institutional environment. But in the U.S., we were nowhere. We were literally nowhere. And it was just happenstance, I guess, with Kieran going to CareFusion and having a very good feel for the amount of effort and time we put into the ventilation space, and it just fitted nicely with the gap that they had. So we're kind of encouraged by that. But on the broader -- in the broader picture, those strategic initiatives that we referred to, taking no particular order of priority, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or more specifically overlap syndrome, where a patient has upper airway instability, plus needs some help with ventilation, that's an area where we see huge potential, roughly 30 million patients in that space. And of that, roughly 1/3 of them having overlap syndrome. That's 10 million people, which are not, we don't believe, being effectively addressed. The second area is, if you like, both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular. In other words, taking into account, transient ischemic attack, stroke. 75% of both TIA and stroke patients have sleep-disordered breathing. We have enough data to know that if you don't treat the sleep-disordered breathing after a patient has either a TIA or a stroke, you're not going to effectively treat them. We need, obviously, to educate neurologists in that space, and we've got plans to do so. In the cardiovascular space, everybody is pretty much now familiar with the connection to atrial fibrillation. And of course congestive heart failure I mentioned, the 800th patient having been added to the survey chip program, and we had unbelievably good results with Adaptive-Servo Ventilation across the globe. That is the sales of the S9 Adaptive-Servo Ventilative products, really, really, really encouraging growth there. And we see that continuing. And obviously, there's also drug-resistant hypertension. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, you've heard me talk about Diabetes -- type 2 Diabetes before. We're working with the Joslin Institute at Harvard. We also have plans to not just work with them, but we've just recently had 2 key opinion leader dinners with international Endocrinologists. There are only about 5,000 in the U.S., so it's not hard to target. And we're kind of excited. The good news is that with our current chuckwagon, we've got all the products we need. Because basically, that's a play with HST and the S9 order set. I mean, that's really the best way to address the issue. And recent data are showing a huge number of patients in that space, 26 million full-blown diabetics in the country, of which 90% are type 2 diabetes. But more importantly or more disturbingly, another 79 million have metabolic syndrome. In other words, you can't tick the box if they're full-blown diabetic patients. But that's 105 million, so take out the 10% type 1s, that's in the 90 -- mid-90 millions of people, of which 80% have sleep-disordered breathing. So we see this as a wonderful opportunity to reduce the expense of the current healthcare system. Then we've got the perioperative care. There's a big meeting coming up in October 14 in Chicago, the Society of Anesthesiology and Sleep Medicine. We were important catalysts in getting that meeting set up. And finally, of course, there's Occupational Health and Safety with truck drivers, railway drivers, pilots and so on and so forth, air traffic controllers and what have you. And we're making really good headwind in those spaces. So it's a long winded,really long winded answer to your question, but in those 5 areas, we'll be making continued investments. And we've got a very strong balance sheet as you know, as Brett said, $635 million net cash. And we are going strategically use that to invest in small technology-based companies where we can direct them into areas that we think are important. And we can take an equity position in them not to make money on the equity. In fact, you could even look at it more as a marketing expense, but to direct them into areas that we think is important and hopefully allow us to kick the ball down the field a little more efficiently and effectively. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but it was an important question.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.: No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Just final question for Brett. This should be pretty quick. Can you quantify what the actual EPS impact of the currency was in the current quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. Michael, for Q4, it's approximately $0.02.
Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.: Positive or negative?
Brett Sandercock: Negative.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Prior with Merrill Lynch.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch: First question on U.S. flow gen growth. Can you delineate or give us any kind of sense as to the growth rate, say, into the CPAP versus APAP? And previously, you've talked about CPAP growing single-digit, APAP growing at double-digit, especially with the trend in home sleep testing. Are we seeing that deviation in growth rate get even bigger? And do you expect that to accelerate in fiscal '12?
Peter Farrell: It's just, really, Matt, a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. In other words, we're seeing a significant growth flowing in the escape the lower-priced units. And the good news is, of course, the clubs are basically the same. But a switch to the order set is definitely occurring. We believe we'll get more data as we go forward, obviously. We've been seeing this is the third quarter that we've seen this. And back to that visit I made to Jonathan Schwartz out in Oklahoma City. Jonathan has a huge sleep program, and he's an exclusive S9 order set user. And he was telling me that it's made him a better physician, he's moved away from the fixed order set completely. And if he's representative, and we believe he is, of what's happening, there's going to be less sales, we believe, in the noncompliance CPAP. The figure he gave me was that, with the SA products -- and the good news is he's been an exclusive ResMed user, and he's a big user for quite a while. So we have really, really tight statistics in terms of compliance. By the way, he said he's compliant. And I'll give you more granularity here, but his compliance was 90% using the S9 order set. I mean, that's an astounding figure. We'd say anything above 75% is magic. So he's getting very, very good compliance. But what he said was that using the S9 order set where we tweaked the algorithm even beyond the S8 -- the S8 was a great product, but this is a magic product -- and he was telling us how good the algorithm was. And his usage of bilevel, that is the noncompliant CPAP, percentage has gone from 15% to 5%. And we are seeing this as well. We're seeing very good growth in the ST, STA and the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation space. In fact, the ASV is just mind bogglingly excellent. I don't want to share what those numbers are, but they brought tears to our eyes. And we're seeing a slowing down of the VPAP S and a slowing down of the low-level CPAP units, but they're all moving to higher-priced devices. And that trend, we see that continuing particularly with the growth of HST.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch: Great. And I guess just a follow-up question, maybe for Brett. I guess, Brett, with this positive mix to APAP or to CPAP and of course, within the mix of bilevel, and then of course, the launch of the Stellar series in the U.S., which should, again, be margin accretive. As I understand, are these the kind of things that should naturally mitigate this gross margin expansion in the second half of fiscal '12 as that'll still lift with CareFusion and bilevel recovers more so?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. I think that's right. We've got -- I think if you look through the product mix and that has been stable for us for a little while now. We see that continuing. We saw some of those trends that Peter articulated, and just sort of moving up their complexity chain, I suppose, in the more sophisticated product. And with that, generally, a better margin as well. And I think there's no reason to believe that trend won't continue.
Peter Farrell: This is Peter, Matt, a word of caution there. I mean, we're not releasing the Stellar 150 until fourth quarter calendar year. And new product launches, as we said earlier, I mean, it's not like a binary thing 0 to 1. I mean, it takes a while for people to test them out and see how good they are. So there's no question that it's going to help, but the rate of which it's going to help, of course, is in the lap of the gods.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch: Sure. My question varies more, but basically this current trend, it's not like you have to chase extra cost out initiatives to offset the effects?
Peter Farrell: Right, it's healthy.
Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch: Is that correct?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, that's right, Matt. We're working on that all the in terms of the cost initiative as well. We're not standing still, so we'll continue with those programs as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Claire with Piper Jaffrays.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies: Yes. I was just hoping, Peter, to maybe dive a little bit deeper into the CareFusion Agreement, When do you think we should see this make a contribution to results in the Americas here? And if you could give us an update on sales force training, and just how the whole agreement is going so far?
Peter Farrell: I'm going to try that to Jeff, but just make a comment. It is a 5-year agreement, and it just involves at the moment, Stellar 100 and the Stellar 150. And of course, they have FDA approval, but we have to train their people. And I mean, the good news for us is we are relatively happy with the volumes that they've told us they can do. It's not going to change our lives, but it's a reasonably comforting figure, and we're happy with the margins and the pricing. And as I said, it's a 5-year agreement. But it is going to take a while to ramp up. Obviously, we've got to train their people and they're going through their own internal changes as well. But over to Geoff, because Geoff was the guy who negotiated -- primarily, negotiated the agreement. So Geoff, would you like to add some comment?
Geoff Neilson: Yes, so we signed the agreement a couple of weeks ago. The training with their sales force is scheduled for September, and we imagine that we're going to be launching that in our Q2. There's going to be a period of sampling and so on, so we don't think we'll see immediate results. The market size is around about $85 million for noninvasive institutional ventilation. CareFusion, they're obviously a strong player in that market, but there's a very strong established player with R&D and the ventilation in these markets, so it's not going to change overnight.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe a quick one for Brett here. The 3% growth that we saw in the Americas, is there any way you could tease out, say, volume versus price versus mix? Was volume still positive overall or how are things shaping up there?
Brett Sandercock: Well, I mean, I don't want to get too granular on what we're looking there. I mean, if the volumes were positive. And the volumes, like it traditionally done, run a few points ahead of revenues, so that trend's still there as well.
Peter Farrell: So, David, we normally figure a 5% decrement in ASPs. And it was of that order. In some cases, a little higher, but about where we expected it to be. So to Brett's point, yes, the volumes were higher than the revenues.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay. And then just one more quick one here, can you tell us about the leadership change at ResMed Ventures?
Peter Farrell: Yes. JC was, as you know, running sales and marketing in the Americas. And the result of discussions of the board was that he should be off at the ResMed Ventures and Initiatives. And this happened fairly quickly. I was on vacation last week and came in Monday morning, and I was planning to have a discussion with JC about the 3 areas I mentioned, the cardiac and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular and perioperative care/risk and the Type 2 diabetes. And he said, well, before we do that, I'd just like to mention that I've accepted another position. And as we talked it through -- look, one of the things that concerned us initially was when you looked at what Jim Hollingshead was doing in the strategy part of our business, and what JC was planning to do, you had about a 75% to 80% overlap, and it looked a little crazy on paper. I wasn't worried about it because the idea of ResMed Ventures and Initiatives is that, that's going to become a P&L responsibility, and that would leave the strategy group just focusing on the future. And the near-term future would be the P&Ls and all the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation business was going to go through there. Narval was going to report through JC. That's the mandibular repositioning device, and also BiancaMed was going to report in. However, it turned out that all the negotiations with BiancaMed were done by Jim Hollingshead, anyway. And Jim is right across the Narval business. And people, internally, were concerned about a little bit about of overlap, I mean, it was not just a little bit, it was 75% to 80%. And therefore, but I said don't worry because this is very quickly, and that's the goal I wanted JC to work on, is turning more of those areas into P&L activities. And JC said, "Look, I've come from a P&L environment with 400-or-so people. And here, I've got to build from ground 0." And he said, "As I thought about it, I just wasn't comfortable." So he actually approached CareFusion. So it wasn't like Kieran saying, "Gee, I'll take all the boys that I can." It wasn't that at all. JC approached him, and I think he's got an absolutely fabulous job. And it took like a nanosecond to say, "Wow, that's good for him." And Jim is all across the ResMed Ventures and Initiatives. So he's the perfect guy to run that group. And I think it's a good outcome all-around. And certainly, no hard feelings. I mean, JC is a great guy. He did a terrific job. He came in with a huge challenge 3.5 years ago. We had only increased year-over-year 5%, and then he brought it up to double-digits and did a great job. And we wished him well, and I think he's going to do a great job.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: I was curious if you have kind of a thought in terms of volume trajectory from here? Do you see things kind of steady as we look at OSA volume growth in '12 in the U.S. and in Europe, trying to isolate that from some of the other dynamics? Or do you see things kind of decelerating with the economy looking a little strange?
Peter Farrell: It's difficult looking into a crystal ball, you don't know what the heck is happening there. Just about everything you hear about the U.S. economy is highly negative. I mean, I think the debt ceiling bill was partially a joke. I mean, you increase the debt ceiling and you'll get a team together and take a look at what you're going to chop out. I mean, there needs to be complete structural change in the U.S., but obviously, we're not on a position to drive that, so we've just got to take what we get. The pundits are suggesting -- the lowest figure I've seen in terms of growth in the U.S. market for devices is 5%, Phillips is looking more like 8%. So you can say 5% to 8%. We would say that it's probably high-single digits, maybe a 7%, something like that 7% or 8%. So given our growth, we feel that we're taking market share. Just what the real number for growth is, we don't know. I think there's going to be a bit of a fill-up from HST. We're confident that's going to happen. Sleep labs are still growing, albeit slowly, maybe a 5% figure will be the lowest, probably closer to 7%, maybe as high as 8%. But that's our expectation, and that's what we're going with. If it's different, it'll be different. But that's what we think it's going to be.
Craig Collie - Macquarie Research: Fine. My second question is, if generator growth in the quarter was about 3%, bilevels were flat versus down over 20%, do you see yourself in an accelerating share-taking move as the next quarter comes in? Because it always took up a couple of quarters to fully launch a new generator. And so are things going to improve over the course of '12 relative to the market? Or are you sort of at your stride and you'll maybe hold that share gain position where it is?
Peter Farrell: That's a good question. And we tend to be a little conservative, I think. And flattish would be a good call, we think. If there's an uptick -- we certainly have stopped the leaky sieve. There's no question about that. It's some very, very encouraging numbers. It's a great product. It's being received according to what our expectations were, which is a good thing. So what we thought was going to happen, did happen. And we think it's going to continue. But we don't feel that there's going to be an acceleration. We think there will be an uptick, and it's just like watch this space -- we've stopped the hemorrhaging in the bilevels for sure. But the trends towards away from lower price CPAP to what I said we believe is going to continue, we think we're going to see a slowing of the noncompliant CPAP, that is the bilevel Ss, the VPAP S. And we see good growth still occurring with the ST, the STA and certainly Adaptive-Servo Ventilation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd: If I could keep on with the devices, if you look to Europe, just wondering with your growth there, how significant was the contribution from ventilation sales in the quarter?
Peter Farrell: We only just launched, I mean, the Stellar 100 -- look, it's going to according to our expectations, but we haven't seen the huge acceleration in bilevels in ROW as yet. And maybe I'll turn that to Geoff. I mean, Geoff's been looking very, very carefully at the market. So Geoff, do you want to make a comment about our growth in ventilation and expectations?
Geoff Neilson: Sure. So I think if you look at our Elysian VS [ph] range, they have a strong position in Homecare in Europe. We just launched Stellar in the -- one quarter ago. And so we've got one quarter results. It's been growing month-over-month. That's now a significant contributor in terms of its getting up to revenues that we're approaching, some of the other products increasing in Europe. But there's a way to go yet. And I think you know with ventilation is it takes longer than the sleep products in order to establish. So I think the growth we see is lower. And we still got to relatively low market shares in the institutions in Europe, and so that's some of the work we've got ahead of us.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd: Right. I mean, I suppose what I was also trying to get at is you sort of said that devices were growing about 7% in constant currency in the rest of world. Is RFO growing faster or slower than that?
Peter Farrell: We think that's about what it's growing at, I would say. We have now more granular understanding of that area, I would say 7 -- I'd be confident it's not going to go below that. And if you ask me what I think is going to happen as we go forward, I'd say it's probably going to go towards 10%. So we're comfortable with the things that are going okay in Europe and Asia Pacific.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd: Good. And so my second question, can I ask about the Mask business, obviously growing very strongly. Could you just comment, how much of that is you winning market share? And how much of that do you think is people trying to -- sort of get their numbers of Masks per annum up?
Peter Farrell: Well, the way I would sort of answer that is we are seeing just wonderful acceptance for the Forex platform. We are the king of the castle in full-faced masks. And the Quattro FX, which Don Back [ph] and his team developed is just really a great product. It's a fabulous product. The Mirage FX, we were getting -- frankly, our tail was getting kicked in the nasal mask category. We were gradually losing market share there, and we were well below 50% of the market. This is such a great product. We like the COGS. We like the way it fits 90-plus percent first time fit. And we are -- the biggest job that we've made in the Masks has been with the nasal Mirage FX. And it's just very encouraging. We love the product, and in fact, Jonathan Schwartz, I may mention, that I spend the day with him and we talked to a dozen patients who were on treatment. The bulk of them were on the Mirage FX. And he said, "This is the best product you guys have ever put out." I think he's exaggerating. We think we have lots and lots of good products. But he was absolutely over the moon. He said, "It is at least 100% better than any other nasal mask that you guys have put out." Be that as it may, that's where our most significant growth has come from. And of course, we're the king of the castle also with nasal pillow. So you've got the full-face masks, and you've got the nasal pillows where we've traditionally been in the very high -- very, very high percentages. And we're in the very low percentage area, around 30% in the nasal category. And we've seen a big, big jump up there. And that, I think, is the major change.
Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd: So you haven't seen any change from what you can sort of get from general feedback on the number of masks that patients are using per annum?
Peter Farrell: It's a very, very -- oh, per annum? We're still seeing figures of north of 1 but below 2. And that's a great -- a big area where we see we can make some inroads. And the data, I think -- you want to say anything about that, Nick? No? So it's sub-2, it's above 1, total 1.5. And that's -- we know even the worst insurers will allow you to have 3 masks a year, CMS-4. And that's obviously an area -- replenishment is an area which has a lot of potential for growth. But just to give you an idea, we would sell 5x as many masks as we do devices. So it's very hard to work out just where they're going. It's replacement. It's being used on other guys' devices. It's our devices. I mean, since we're not selling, in most cases, direct to customers, it's almost impossible to work out when you've got a ratio of 5:1, just where the Masks are ending up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: Just touching on the rest of world growth, if I could get you to talk about, geographically, were there any particular countries that were better or worse than you've seen in trend terms?
Peter Farrell: There was nothing that spooked us there at all. I mean, constant currency was 8%. Asia Pac tends to be a little lumpy. Obviously, when you've got a distributor in Japan, it's obviously a big part of Asia Pac, and there was a bit of a hiccup, as you know, with the tsunami and so forth. Japan tends to be lumpy anyway, but when you have such a big customer like Teijin, obviously that's going to continue to be lumpy. Germany is our biggest market outside the U.S. Germany is going along pretty well. France is going along very well. And then you've got a smattering of Norway, Sweden, and so forth, the Middle East and the U.K. and so forth. There's been nothing there that spooked us in terms of growth rates in either Germany or France, our 2 biggest markets. And the lumpiness that we expect from Asia Pac still continues. But nothing...
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: Low constant currency growth of ROW numbers, you'd be comfortably going back to around the 10% level on average?
Peter Farrell: Yes. I must say, I was even a little surprised at the 8%. I would have expected 10%. But in talking to Stein, I had to check to him this morning. Stein Jacobson who runs our European operations, and nothing that's spooking him.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: But I guess the fear with Europe in particular is that there's going to be funding pressure. Now, my sense is we haven't really seen much impact from that. I was just leary as to whether that was an explanation in this quarter?
Brett Sandercock: David, Brett. Europe still remains pretty solid particularly across our emerging markets. And really, if you look at that CC growth rate, Asia Pac, that region was actually a drag on that this quarter. So they experienced low growth there. That was predominantly with Japan, and you now have some of the issues that we've had with the earthquake and so on. And as Peter said, it is traditionally lumpy. So, yes, I don't think there's anything to read into this particular quarter on that. Europe remains pretty solid and Asia Pac, lumpy as ever. But Japan is probably working through some of their issues, as well, in terms of their own country issues around the earthquake and so on. So overall, we still remain pretty pleased with the rest of the world growth.
Peter Farrell: David, let me make one other comment there, which David Pendarvis just reminded me of, and it is a big thing. We launched the S9 in France and Germany this time last year, and it went gangbuster. So we had just dreadful comparables, if you like, with a new product that everybody loved. Bingo. We had huge growth the previous year, so we had a huge mountain to climb. So that's the reason that it was softer than what one might expect.
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes, now that's a very fair point. Just one other question then. Just on the acquisitions, so we've seen a couple of small acquisitions. Can I get you to talk about what to the level of spending or what the cost has been, or what you expect to spend there over the next 12 months?
Peter Farrell: It's factored in. We said that the BiancaMed -- look, Grundler is making money. In terms of revenues, we're talking about a few million. And we don't have FDA approval for Grundler products in the United States. So how long's that going to take? How long is a piece of string sort of thing? We will be seeking FDA approval, obviously. We need to do it. We will do it. But they are making money, so there's not going to be a hit from the Grundler acquisition. And as we said when we bought BiancaMed, it's roughly $0.04 for the year with BiancaMed. And I don't think it's going to be any different. Maybe, Brett, you might want to add some more to that but...
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: I guess I was trying to understand how much you're spending. So $635 million of cash on the balance sheet is something we've always looked at with great interest as to what the plans are. We've seen these acquisitions, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether we're going to see $100 million go into acquisitions or is it going to become like...
Peter Farrell: Yes. We don't have anything immediately on the plate that we're looking at to be candid, but that doesn't mean there won't be. $100 million acquisition could happen, could happen. But there is nothing -- there's nothing that we're -- we're very familiar with Grundler and we're very familiar with BiancaMed. There are no other similar type companies that we've been working with for a long time that we're about to make an offer on. On the other hand...
David Low - Deutsche Bank AG: Outside the buybacks, the cash level continues to go up?
Peter Farrell: Yes. Yes, outside the -- Yes. But look, let me tell you that we are looking very carefully as to how we should deploy it. So I could say now, we're not sort of putting the ruler over a number of other companies, but we intend to, that's for sure. And Jim Hollingshead, who's currently in India, when he gets back we'll be taking a good hard look of the terrain and seeing what's there that might help us move the ball down the field.
Operator: We are now at the one hour mark, so we'll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.
Peter Farrell: Well, thank you all for joining. And let me just say that we continue to be excited by -- as we look out into the future. Innovative products rolling out over the year. We're especially excited about the FX Masks and the new S9 platform. The market for our sleep-disordered breathing is still highly under-penetrated. We have a robust balance sheet, which we just talked about. We're certainly generating cash in the vicinity of $0.25 billion a year. And finally, we have an absolutely first-rate team of people to assure continuing strong execution. And I want to thank all the staff, particularly those that are listening, for their commitment and loyalty. And we see great things happening in the sleep industry, and also within the company, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. So, thanks again.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Good day.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2010 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jennifer and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions). The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the Company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may accessed through the Company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.
Kieran Gallahue: Thanks, Jennifer. Well good afternoon and welcome ResMed's second quarter Earnings Call, as with our previous calls I'll be in with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then take your questions. Well, we are very pleased to report today that we just achieved an important milestone at ResMed by crossing the billion dollar mark in trailing 12 month revenue, and reporting our 60th consecutive quarter of revenue growth with another very solid quarter. We are pleased to report that revenues in the second quarter of 2010 grew 23% or up 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew by 20% year-over-year, ROW revenue increased by 27% and in constant currency terms grew 14%. In contrast to recent quarters, currency movement has a positive impact on ROW revenue this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 36% to $0.60. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was two pennies better at $0.62 per share. We're pleased to report that in the face of the strengthening Australian dollar, gross margins were 59.7% or approximately 60% in Q2 benefiting from the continued success in leveraging manufacturing and logistics cost efficiencies across our global organization, and offset primarily by the depreciation of the Aussie dollar. Cash flow from operations was $11.6 million, operating cash flow for the December quarter was adversely impacted by the timing of the $61.7 million income tax payment that we mentioned would be forthcoming during our last quarter conference call.  We expect cash flow to return to robust levels as we continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong operating performance and earnings, and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely solid with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q2 just over $451million. We also experienced balance growth across product categories with global flow generator sales up 29% or up 21% constant currency, and mass segments growing at 17% during the quarter a 13% increase on a constant currency basis. Sales of America's flow generators were up 24% year-over-year in Q2 and sales in ROW, improved to 17% in constant currency terms. Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, once again led by our AutoSet CS and BiPAP Auto, where we have a large advantage in both noise and comfort. The whispered quite comfortable performance of the Easy-Breathe continues to be recognized in best in class and is truly helping us differentiate ResMed as best in class from our competitors.  In the mask category we believe we continue to take market share in both new patient populations and the installed base. Mask sales were quite robust this quarter growing 16% in the Americas and in constant currency terms 8% in ROW. Our newly launched soft-gel mask is off to an encouraging start in its early days and we've had a fabulous response from both physicians and from patients. We expect to continue launching various sizes in the Americas and broadening our launch to other geographies throughout this year. The market is telling us that they appreciate the value and the comfort of quietness that this mask demonstrates.   The Swift FX the newest member of the Swift family and our lightest mask to-date launched outside the Americas during Q1 and has just launched in the Americas, so it is just now going global in all sizes, just as with the soft-gel mask the feedback has been outstanding. So with these new masks in the marketplace we remain focused on growing market-share with high margins, industry leading products. Last March we indicated that we would have a very active 18 or so months on product launches, as you can see from the past month we are well on track to meeting that commitment. Today we are officially announcing the release of our newest generation of flow generators, the ResMed F9 series. The initial introduction will be the F9 AutoSet and the F9 Elite products expanding to other flow generators over time. We expect the launch to begin first in Europe and then expand to the Americas later this quarter. We're extremely proud and excited about the unique advantages of the F9 and what they will bring to the market. The F9 will have a new look and feel that will integrate within the bedroom while delivering advanced and improved feature such as (inaudible) and heated circuit or hose for improved patient comfort, a simplified user interface, and an enhanced AutoSet algorithm, it is absolutely going to be an outstanding product.  A quick update on home sleep testing, the home sleep testing continues to be piloted in various forms. It is proven that HST was here to stay in calendar year 2008 and in calendar year 2009, just as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models. We're working closely with our sleep division partners to make home sleep testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. We've heard that a growing number of commercial payers are in discussions on recommending and perhaps even requiring HST as a first line diagnostic. We also expect growth results to continue to improve the awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays in a very serious most rapidly growing, most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races its becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand-in-hand with sleep disorder breathing and that treatment for SDB cannot only improve health, but also dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations.  We also know that SDB can have a substantial effect on presenteeism, as well as absenteeism and will represent a large opportunity within occupational health and safety and the transportation business for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorder breathing. Finally as part of our strategy to improve awareness of sleep disorder breathing and the physician community, we're embarking on a series of branded and unbranded education programs. As previously reported we are involved in collaboration with Phillips to support the sleep communities' efforts to educate primary care physicians funded with educational grants. This is just part of our continued commitment to raising the awareness of the dangers of sleep disorder breathing within the medical community.  So, in summary Q2 once again demonstrated the strength of our global reached and balanced business while providing very positive signals for sustained industry growth as we look forward. Our new product flow is robust and customer meaningful and demonstrates that our commitment to innovation is paying dividends. Before I turn over the call to Brett, I just want to remind everyone, or inform those of you who haven't heard, that we'll ring in the closing bell at the end NYSE on Monday February 8th. We'll be hosting an investor relations meeting at the exchange beforehand, if you'd like to attend or leave details, please contact Connie Bienfait, our Director of Investor Relations. Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional details. Brett? 
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Kieran. So I'll briefly run through our December quarter results, revenue as mentioned for the December quarter was $275.1million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. We did have favorable currency movements that increased second quarter revenues by approximately $13.3 million. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 17% over the prior year quarter.  Income from operations for the quarter was $57.9 million an increase of 34% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $46 million an increase of 36% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 an increase of 36% over the prior year quarter. Gross margins for the December quarter was 59.7%, down sequentially from Q1FY10, largely attributed to an unfavorable currency impact resulting from the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. Looking forward exchange rate volatility will continue to manifest in our gross margins. In particular a recent depreciation of the Euro against the US dollar together with the strong Australian dollar will impact our gross margins.  SG&A expenses for the quarter were $84.1 million an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increases by a modest 10% over the prior year quarter. The increases in SG&A reflects expenses to support sales growth as well as activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 30.6% compared to the year ago figure of 31.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in that 31% range for the balance of the fiscal year 2010.  R&D expenses for the quarter were $19.1 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 1% over the prior year quarter. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and again subject to currency movements we'd expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in that 7% range for the balance of the fiscal year. We continue to devote significant resources to product innovation and clinical study activities.  Amortization of acquired intangibles were $2.1million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.3 million. During the quarter we also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate will be in the vicinity of 27%. Turning now to revenues in more detail, overall American sales were $148 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks, with strong contributions from our high end APAP devices, full face masks, and incremental revenue from our recently launched gel mask. Sales outside the Americas totaled $127.1 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year quarter. As expected, sales outside the Americas were positively impacted by currency movements. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenues between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $75.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Masks in other styles were $72.1 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Fr revenues outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $86.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 17%. Masks and other sales were $40.9 million, an increase of 18%, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8% over the prior year. On a group basis and constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 21% while masks and other increased by 13%.  Cash flow from operations was $11.6 million for the quarter. The operating cash flow was impacted by the timing of income tax payment totalled $61.7 million during the quarter. Our underlying cash flow remains very strong. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.5 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totalled $15.6 million. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 606,000 shares for consideration of $30.1 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. As of today we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares out of a total authorized buyback of 10 million shares. Our balance sheet remains strong and conservatively geared. For December 1, total assets stored at $1.6 billion and net equity was $1.3 billion. Group external debt was $145 million while cash and cash equivalents totalled $451 million. I'll now hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue: All right. Thanks, Brett. Jennifer, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator's Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis Bleichroeder.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Hey, guys. Congrats here on a really impressive quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I have a bunch, but I'll try to keep it brief here. First, just market commentary. I know we always ask that just kind of what you see out there and anything picking up, slowing down, or pretty status quo?
Kieran T. Gallahue: The market remains robust. We still think the market growth is around what we've experienced this past year. The indications out there at this point, our physician awareness, clinical awareness, continues to grow. And from the Americas perspective, HST continues to be piloted. We continue to good progress in that space. I'd hesitate to say that it's material yet in the results. I think that's probably more ahead of us than behind us seeing the impact of HST. 
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. And then a lot of people obviously talking about the competitive landscape. With the announcement of the S9 obviously concerns will be less, but can you just give us a little bit of color? I mean, this quarter constant currency growth actually accelerated. I know it takes a while to ramp up the S9, so should we see some trialing maybe next quarter as that would be the peak of the trialing and then coming back in your fourth quarter we see you guys fighting back or are you guys just not feeling it at all?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well, I think it's important to recognize that some of the competitive launches that have occurred here in the last couple of months are, in our view, attempts to catch up to what has been in the marketplace now for the last 18 months. The S8 II series of products that were underpinned with this Easy-Breathe motor technology and the wave forms that are associated with the Easy-Breathe wave forms have been extremely well received within the marketplace and they create a fundamental sort of base for us to compete against new products. So the new products that have rolled out, they're going to get trial. We assume that the completive products got a good trial, but I got to tell you, our field sales forces felt very comfortable walking into those same accounts with the high quality ResMed products, the quiet ResMed products with the algorithms that are associated with it and we still feel very comfortable competing with the S8 II. In our opinion, you look at the S9, that's a bonus on top of that.  And when you look at the product and people get the ability to physically look at this product and then be able to experience its ease of use to be able to look at some of the feature sets that are very patient meaningful and they're going to be customer meaningful as well because they are oriented towards improving compliance and simplifying the ability for patients to adapt to therapy. In addition to providing additional revenue streams for some of the customers there is a lot of good things that are going to come out with this S9. Now, our intention is to launch it like we have sort of the classic ResMed way if you will, so rolling it out first in Europe, then we are going to be rolling it out towards the end of this quarter in the US. You're absolutely right in your comments that it takes several months for you to get around and start seeing that ramp and really feel that materiality as we get into fiscal year 2011. So we're excited about that launch process. And just as in sort of our classic way we're going to start with the AutoSet and the Elite and then over time we'll fill out the CPAP area as well as move over to the bio levels. So we're feeling good at what we're at and we'll be rolling it out through the rest of this fiscal year.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great, and then I'll let other people have a chance, but just to be clear, you have not yet launched outside the US, but you will be shortly? And then I guess are we going to get to see a sample, if you will, at the investor day next week?
Kieran T. Gallahue: All right, great. So actually we've begun the early shipments in Europe, but again like I'm saying, these things kind of ramp up, but we're absolutely delivering product and have been for about a week or so. I'm looking at (inaudible), but yeah that last week or so, and yes you'll absolutely be able to see a device during the investor day next week.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Andrew with William Blair & Company, LLC.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on a couple of things briefly. Brett, could you give us some sense of the impact of currency on gross margin if you could isolate it? And then how did that flow throughout the bottom line once you back out hedging gain and what not?
Brett Sandercock: If you looked at that sequential decline, the vast majority of that would have been impact that's currency related is basically the real driver on that.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: So the sequential decline in the gross margin percentage of over a full point was just currency?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, predominantly. I mean, as you know there's plenty of factors that impact the geographic mix, product mix, manufacturing and so on in the mix, but if you look at it and say what's the predominant driver it was currency and it was the appreciation of the Aussie.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: Okay, great. And then the lag effect in terms of that flowing through, are we right to think of that as maybe two or even as long as three quarters when — because now we have had a recovery a bit in the dollar so it wouldn't look like gross margin based on currency is going to recover for a couple of quarters?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. It's certainly not as long as three quarters. It'll be around that one-and-a-half-quarter mark, that lag impact. So still some of that to flow through, but you're right, the Aussie — well, you know how volatile currencies are at the moment but the Aussie has come off from $0.925 to about I think under $0.87 within the last three weeks. So clearly that's coming down. It'll take a little while to flow through, but we'll get that benefit down the track for sure.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: Okay. Two other quick questions. Kieran, you mentioned you've had kind of a minimal impact or benefit from the gel mask so far. I mean, is that $10 million or something that we should look for or even that that we should look for a substantially different dynamic in the next couple of quarters?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yeah. You know, Ben, we don't get into that sort of line item detail when we break out revenues just because it's sort of a slippery slope over time of detail, but what I intend to say is that the product has been very well received. The way a product like this launches is that not all sizes are available Day 1. So you get out the predominant sizes and then over the course of several months you fill out the rest of the SKUs, you fill out your sampling packages, et cetera. So the initial shot over the bow came during Q2, and what you'll see throughout Q3 is exactly what I just described, filling out of the rest of the SKUs. We expect by the end of the quarter we'll be shipping all the SKUs in that product and we'll be fully up on the samples and then we'll be full steam ahead. And I got to tell you, the early feedback has been fantastic. It's really encouraging. And not only on the gel, the gel and the Swift FX. When you look at some of the customer testimonials and the patient testimonials that have been coming in, these are darn good products. So we’re looking forward to them. And by the way, as you know mass products tend to be on the side of gross margin contributors. So we’re certainly looking forward to that continued expansion as well.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: And last structural question, I mean, one thing we’ve noticed in the last several, really probably couple of years, has been the mix shift in Europe changing substantially in favor of generators. And particularly this quarter you grew generators quite a bit faster than masks, it looks like worldwide. I mean, that supposedly in the face of a new competitive launch. Now you’ve got all these new products. Is that going to balance out where we’ll see more balance growth from your perspective the next four quarters with all of these new launches?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well, I think if you go historically, you’ve tended to see in Europe that actually on a consistent basis you tend to see the flow generators do represent a larger percentage of the revenues in Europe. And you do tend to see higher growth rates in those categories, right. So, and remember also in Europe you have the ventilation line which is a flow generator heavy part of what we do. And you don’t have that in the US. So, as we look forward, I think we’re very much in a reasonably balanced phase of the product launches. Certainly as we look at some of the new mask launches that gives us continue, hope to, to grow those categories and to continue to penetrate them. But I’d say we’re in a pretty classic mix. Brett, do you have anything to add to that?
Brett Sandercock : Yeah, I mean, I think, some of that European, I think it’s turning to really good consistent results coming out of Germany out of the last (inaudible). And some of the mix that we had in Germany we’ve passed that now completely, getting good growth out of that. And as you know in Germany it’s time care, so it’s really quite generator driven. Nice that in fact that the cost of that business sort to speak. So I think some of that driving through is waiting for those nice out performance and flow generators in Europe. Been throwing in the mix also, we’ve got the S-9 launch which is a new platform. So I think over time you’ll get back to historical levels where (inaudible) will grow stronger than flow gen. But with some many new product launches that some of that mix might change a little over the short term.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: I guess the first question here, just a quick one on the soft gel. When do you think we should expect that OUS?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Soft gel OUS? Outside of the US. 
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Sorry, IOW.
Brett Sandercock : We’re expecting to launch in France early March. And then we’ll progressively roll out over the next four to eight weeks on country by country.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great. And then, Brett, just kind of with where foreign exchange rates are, where they’ve been over the last couple months here. What do you think we should expect from a gross margin perspective, say in the next quarter here? Will we be above the 59% or how should we think about it?
Brett Sandercock : Just on the exchange rates through the volatility at the moment, the quarter to quarter estimate is just not making sense at the moment. Give you a lot of color on that. I mean, you know what exchange rates are doing as well as I do. And you know that they’ll be short term, there’s probably some head wins with the Euro. The lag on the Aussie, but that’ll held at – by the next few quarters after that. But I think what I would say, the FOREX we can’t really control. But I’m really confident and comfortable with our ability to expand the GM through strong – when you put out the flow for example, limiting our cost structure which we’ve been doing, managing cogs and continuous improvement programs. We’re working hard to do all that. And we’re looking at (inaudible) as well. And part of innovation and the product flow we’ve designed to do that. So I think we’re doing everything we can and working pretty hard to withstand the margins. But in short terms we will be subject to some of the volatility around those currencies. And we’ll just have to deal with that and keep doing what we need to do.  The only other thing I’d say, we have been working pretty hard over the last few years to diversify our prospect away from the Aussie dollar. And we have been relatively successful. We’ve done through materials purchasing, Singapore manufacturing, for example. And just trying to contain those operational costs. So we’ll continue to do that as well. And it doesn’t mean to say we won’t be impacted because we will. Just not as bad as it was, for example, two years ago. But I don’t want to dismiss the currency impact that’s there. But it’s short term as well as (inaudible) and the underlying sustainable margin improvement we’re absolutely working on.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Then that was sort of good lead in for my next question. Just an update on Singapore? Where are we in terms manufacturing?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Singapore has been a very successful venture for us. The plant came up to speed quite rapidly. We’ve now celebrated what our 13-14 months of operations. We’re already producing about 20% of our volume our of Singapore. So we’ve been just very pleased with the quality of the work force with their ability to integrate our products into a quality system to be able to mirror the success that we’ve seen in Sydney. And at the same time be able to provide some of the costs and tax advantages that are associated with Singapore. So we’re very pleased with where we’re at.  We continue to build capabilities there. The initial phases were really about, what’s called assembly type work. Over the course of these year we’re going to continue to build out some of the capabilities and for instance manufacturing of motors. So that we can not only produce in the LA area but we can also have a secondary source within a company. And Singapore, we look at building some capabilities on the LSR, so the moving capabilities, etcetera, itself. We’ve got a very strong foundation. It ramped up quickly. And we’re feeling very comfortable with the ability to continue to ramp that. We’re not giving any specific estimates what we want to produce there. But I can tell you we feel very comfortable with our ability to ramp.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great. Congratulations on a great quarter.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Could I perhaps just ask you to just detail the features (inaudible) of S9 a little bit more. And I guess in particular just some of the smarts that you’ve added in this time around that are really going to differentiate you from your competitors?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yeah. Let me throw the ball over to McFarrell who runs (inaudible).
Peter C. Farrell Ph.D.: Andrew, there are many benefits that would take the length of this conference call to cover. But obviously you’re not really there to that level of detail on investor relations a bit like this. If I could summarize the three major benefits, I’d focus on the three Cs that it brings, comfort, compliance and connectivity. There’s more including cost effectiveness and others. But the comfort that you can get from this product from the new climate line system that provides a heated wire circuits. We’ve closed loop control of temperature and humidity. Incredible. The enhanced (inaudible), which brings even low (inaudible) and more comfort and low worker breathing for the patient. Which all leads to greater compliance. Which is what the patient wants. It’s what the provider wants. And it’s what the insurance company wants as well. But we’ve also added increased expansion of conductivity. So we’ve taken our S9 wireless capability that we have really worked on these last five years on the S7 and S8 range to the next level. And we’ve added other ways to get connectivity. So I don’t want to go into too many more details on it. Other than to say that the initial reception from our internal sales teams, the French national sales team earlier this quarter got it and they launched at the national pneumology conference this last weekend in France. Amazing reception from the physicians and from customers.  So early days but seeing great response in Europe and looking forward to the full data of the quarter, taking it to the rest of the world.
Kieran T. Gallahue: It is a fantastic product series. This is going to be – just as SA2 and the easy breeze motor technology established a new level within the market place, this certainly has the potential to do the same. And again, we haven’t released it yet in the US. So we’re waiting later in the quarter and the availability and the access to everyone is going to be quite easy.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: We were hearing one of the features was, I guess, feedback to the patient that they could measure how good a night of sleep they were getting. Could you perhaps expand on that if that’s one of the features?
Kieran T. Gallahue : Sure, Andrew, I’ll talk about that too. You seem to know quite a lot about this. I love to talk about it. And it ties into my second C there, which is compliance. Having that sort of bio feedback mechanism where a patient can – the day after their therapy, at the discretion of their provider and physician mind you, have access to the hours of use that they had that night. And the (inaudible) given to the patient by a smiley face or a frowny face depending on the (inaudible) is up and above the 0.4 maybe the second sort of gradient that’s accepted standard for acceptable mouth rates. I spoke potentially, again, at the discretion of the provider or the physician, an efficacy measure such as AHI.  And the patient can have access to those. What we’ve seen in our clinical trials of this device and in the early market acceptance in our controlled product launches is that patients who have access to data get more engaged in therapy. And that’s sticking it through the therapy in those first seven days leads to months and years and years of trailing revenues for the provider in masks and accessories and for the homecare provider or the HME involved, but also on going compliance reduction of chronic health care and disease problems, such as Type II diabetes and cardiovascular recurrences and others that can be improved by ongoing care. So it's a great combination again for the patient, the physician, the provider, and ResMed as well as we contribute to that.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS:  Yeah. That's a really nice feature. Maybe just in the interest of time can I just ask a final question just in terms of your growth outlook? Maybe just help me understand what you're seeing in terms of home sleep testing? I know you've talked to the insurers sort of requiring that as the first line, and then perhaps you also mentioned in the release, just transport safety. If I could just ask sort of on both those camps where things are progressing?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Sure. So the home sleep testing is progressing right along the schedule that we predicted a couple of years ago. First year it was out there, first calendar year, it was really about is it here to stay or not and clearly it is. Last year was about the initiation of pilots in different types of providers; some HMEs, some primary-care physicians, some independent diagnostic testing facilities, and certainly sleep physicians. And there were a number of pilots that we're aware of that have used, by the way, various types of diagnostic devices and have tried different processes to accomplish it. And as you might expect, some of the business models flushed out and others are doing quite well. So that's progressing well. And what's very interesting and encouraging actually is in the last — oh G-d, it's probably about 14 weeks or so, we've heard a very different voice even among the sleep physicians where the understanding the acceptance that home sleep testing is here to stay and it makes most sense to understand how to integrate that within your practice . The number of questions, the interest in getting involve in pilots and acquiring home sleep testing devices has increased substantially. So I think that's a good signal for the market to say look, the pilots are working and it's time to move forward with greater acceptance. Now, there was the three Ps we've always talked about; it was process, it was payment, and it was politics. The process and the payment we've really figured out. People are getting paid for it and the process is what I just mentioned. The politics is really driven by the payers moving from a you can do HST to a you must do HST, and that's what we referred to. There's some insurance companies in certain parts of the country that are piloting with that, but it's a little bit harder to predict exactly when they're going to flip to that you must phase, although we do know that some large insurers are considering it. They have put together teams to look at it and it certainly wouldn't be surprising if before the end of this calendar year, again hard to predict, but it wouldn't be surprising if one of the large ones moves and starts requiring that. And then that just opens up the gate towards further enhancement. So this is a good process for the industry to follow. You don't want it happening all at once because things fall apart then. This process of the gentle boil, of working out the pilots, of getting it integrated, and showing that it actually promotes good care and it's not going to promote some overuse or overutilization has been very positive. That does roll into occupational health and safety. The interest within the transportation sector in the trucking community, the airline pilots, boat riders and what not, there is a number of companies that have sprung up to try to serve those and there are some large customers that are already in the HME business as an example, or in the sleep diagnosis business, which are trying to integrate that into their practice. So I'd say that that foundation continues to be built. It always takes a little longer than you think it's going to take, but all the signals are positive.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: That's terrific. Thank you very much, great quarter. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse: Good morning, guys. Just had two questions, the first is just on the balance sheet. Your cash balance is starting to look quite large, just wondering if there were any comments you could give particularly on the buyback and whether you might look to accelerate that or any other type of capital management? The second question is maybe for Kieran, you moved with the Narval purchase outside of CPAP, just wondering if you could expand your thoughts on or give us some commentary on how you're looking at the mild to moderate sleep apnea market going forward? Thanks.
Kieran T. Gallahue: So on the capital management side yeah, we do have a very strong balance sheet. We mentioned the cash balance and of course we've got about $140-$150 million in debt that offsets that. We're very comfortable with the position we've taken to date. You know that we again acquired about $30 million of our own stock back during this last quarter and that's in addition to what we've done over the prior two years so we feel comfortable continuing to participate in those stock buybacks at an appropriate basis, and as Brett mentioned, we still have about 8.5 million shares left in that authorization for the buyback program. And we're always looking at other appropriate uses for cash, but we're very careful to let it burn a whole in our pocket and to look to do, for instance, M&A that is not appropriate or that we think is not going to add value to the business or that we think doesn't leverage the strength of the ResMed team. So we feel comfortable with what we've done to date.  As it relates to Narval, that acquisition is now complete. The team is in the midst of integration. It was a low risk way of putting a toe in the water of complimentary technologies for the treatment of mild sleep disorder breathing and particularly of obstructive sleep apnea. It is, just to remind those on the phone, a company that's based in Leon, France which is great because it's right next to where our commercial headquarters is in France and in fact we're going to be combining those facilities shortly. We've already begun integrating the teams. It is one of two players — only two players in the market within France that have reimbursement for these MRD devices, and they already had a running start. They have a reputation within the industry, and maybe most importantly for us, we saw a pathway to profitability by participating in this category. They use CAD/CAM technology for much of their manufacturing and we saw that as a technology that allows scalability and allows the device manufacturer to actually make a return on these, and we can leverage our experience, our history, our relationships within the sleep community and be able to appropriately promote these technologies, again for the appropriate uses.  So it's an experiment at this point that's going well and as appropriate we're going to investigate other countries to expand into and we'll look at everything you'd expect us to look at. We're going to look at the distribution that's required in those marketplaces, we're going outlook at the price points in those marketplaces, and we're going to look at our strengths in those marketplaces, and then market by market we'll make a business decision about expansion. So early days, but we're very pleased with that acquisition.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Merrill Lynch/Bank of America.
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick question on the S9 if I can. You talked a lot about management by exception in the last quarter focusing on compliance, and compliance certainly seems to become an increasing issue for the industry. Can you talk about ResTraxx at all and whether that feature is within the S9 or whether we're persisting with it or increasing its emphasis with the S9.
Peter C. Farrell Ph.D.: Yeah, Matthew. We will have the ability to do management by exception with the S9 system and there will be an S9 wireless module that will connection the back of the S9 devices that takes the data from the device to the cloud and allows the home care providers, HME, and physicians, to have access on a protected basis to that information and so they can go and manage their patients and choose how, where, and when to get back to their patients to encourage them to increase their therapy or participate more in their therapy or address mask leak or look at say a central apnea index going up and maybe the patient doesn't need just the basic CPAP and APAP, maybe they need an upgrade to a VPAP adapt or some other sort of adaptive server inhalation technology and need to get back into the sleep channel on that front. So we will have the capability on the S9 platform and it's actually a great advantage for us. No other industry on the S8 II platform had that and we look forward to continuing that on the S9. 
Kieran T. Gallahue: And just add a little color as well, you did mention the management by exception and one of the things that Mick had highlighted earlier were a number of the feature set that are designed for improved comfort and improved compliance. So our true objective here first of all is to produce the exceptions to make it easier for people to get compliance, and then certainly using our leadership positioning in our wireless monitoring to be able to make those few exceptions that do exist then or for those exceptions that do exist to certainly be able to treat them in the most cost effective way.
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America: Thanks. And just one quick followup question; obviously you have access to that data, does that assist you with product development given that the data would be quite powerful seeing what age, what profile, what combination of equipment, is leading to compliance?
Kieran T. Gallahue: We're very careful about the use of patient data. That's proprietary to the physicians and to the care providers and so we are very careful about that. We have other ways of gathering that data. We have very strong relationships in the sleep community and our innovation team is very successful. We don't need to look at those avenues for data. It's a good question, but that's not what we want to use the data for.
Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Kieran, just a question on market. I mean, I know the question was asked before, but I guess if you could talk about the fact that you've clearly taken some market share, what do you think the underlying market growth is? And I guess my question really is centered on the fact that from what we understand or the feedback that we're getting is that volume of patients going through sleep centers, it doesn't seem to be as strong as it has been in the past, and with home testing, by your own sort of commentary still sort of a story for next year, I mean do you see any concern that the underlying market is declining? I'm trying to understand where your market share has been going in that environment.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yeah. These are the same questions that have really been coming up for the last year, year and a half, and I'm pleased that we can say that it's been consistent that we remain very positive that you have double-digit growth. The Americas, we had said about a year ago we thought it would come off maybe a couple of points, but it was still up around the 12% or so range. I think we continue to feel comfortable that that's about right, perhaps a few points ahead of that on volume, but that would be on a revenue basis. And in Europe in the high single digits, and so for a blended growth rate in the double-digit ranges. So I think we still feel the underlying strength in that market. I think you have to be careful when you're looking at these proxies. Part of what you're missing sometimes when you look at just one indicator of potential growth, let's say number of beds is first of all there is still bed growth and sometimes you have better bed utilization. So for instance you have people that were doing two-night studies that will go to a split-night study. So instead of doing a study one night and the next night a titration, they'll get the patient all in one night or they're working at how to reduce their no-show lists, et cetera.  So there's a lot of different avenues that can contribute to growth on that side, and then in addition you continue to have HMEs were are working at maintaining compliance. The stick, if you will, that CMS put out there a year and a half ago could very well be the best thing that happened for patient care because what it said is you the HME need to spend more time making sure these patients are compliant or else you don't get paid in the short run. And we know that once you get those patients compliant in not only the short run, but they represent very significant opportunity in the longer run with continued accessory sales, continued market sales, and eventually continued CPAP sales. So that's been a positive contributor as well that as people maintain their focus on compliance it's a good situation for the industry and it helps the focus on trailing annuities.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Are you able to measure internally as to what level of repeat sales or how much of your revenue base is coming from the sales to existing patients versus new patients?
Kieran T. Gallahue: It's very difficult to get that level of granularity. You have HMEs which are very protective of their data and it's the same SKU, if you will, that goes to a new patient versus an existing patient. So we have some proxies where we have certain customers that do their compliant user replenishment through certain locations so we get a sense for their focus, but I think more importantly it's in our customer relationships where we get feedback from the sales force and know that patients are instituting these replenishment programs.  So I can't break it down to the figures and I certainly couldn't do it on a short-term basis, but I think we do feel comfortable that that focus on generating compliance and then mining the compliant users continues to expand.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and just one final question on that. So the growth rates or the market growth that you've talked about this year end and last, if we talk about home testing starting to become material over the next few years, is that on top of that growth rate do you think? I mean, is this a boost coming in the next couple of years?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yeah look, I think there's no reason that home sleep test can't improve the volume of patients going through this market. Again you never get into sort of the quarter-to-quarter stuff, but if you look at it over the medium term, if you look at it over the longer term, and you look at what home sleep testing brings, it stops or it eliminates some forms of leakage. So let's just talk about two of them as an example. 30% of the patients who get a referral to a sleep lab never show up, and why don't they show up? They don't show up maybe because it's a several hundred dollar co pay, they don't show up because they've got to be away from their family for a night. They don't show up because they don't want to be wired up like Gulliver's Travels with a camera on them all night. It's not very comfortable when you think about it.  Now, lots of people still do it which tells you how important this disorder is and how important treating this disorder is, but still, 30% don't show up. If HST does nothing other than take that 30% number to 15%, you're talking about a 20% increase in the flow of patients that get diagnosed at that point, right? Then there's a secondary form of leakage which is — now again, put yourself in the place of a primary-care physician and you are looking at a patient and trying to determine whether to send them to a sleep lab or have a sleep test. If they have an expensive test that's very inconvenience, your index of suspicion has to be pretty darn high before you send them to that test. Now you have a test that's simple to use, that can be used in their own home, but is still highly accurate — that borderline case that maybe you weren't going to send for a sleep test before, now you're going to be willing to send. So if you just strip away everything else and just focus on the facts and the common sense piece of it, the ability for this to contribute to growth I think I quite significant and I think as a company we're very comfortable with that.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Right. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bye with Jefferies & Co.
Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks, guys. Just a couple of ones on a lot of concern on pricing in the market over the years and we noticed Invacare just raised their oxygen concentrator prices to the homecare dealers about 4%-5%. I know it's a different market, but I guess does that say anything to you about the reception out there what's coming in competitive bidding or sort of any takeaway for the sleep market?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well, I don't know about a direct corollary with that action, but I will say in general the market remains healthy. We got into this with the questions before on gross margin and I think as Brett very well articulated, we feel just real comfortable with our product flow. We feel very comfortable with our ability to reduce our cost per future set that we're delivering, and we feel comfortable with the ability to continue to provide premium products with new feature sets that can allow us to have customers trade up within the marketplace, just as we've seen with the auto setting devices because of the data capabilities and because of the Easy-Breathe motor technology. And as we've seen in the bilevel category which historically we've been very underpenetrated and we've been able to, with what we believe is a superior product, 75%+ quieter than the competition, very responsive — we're able to move in there and trade them up. So we see the market. Certainly price pressures won't go away tomorrow. The ability to significantly raise prices I think would be difficult to forecast that, but I think through product mix on one side, through delivering feature sets that are meaningful that can drive compliance, can reduce cost of delivering the product for the customer — we have, I think, a very strong value proposition.
Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.: Okay. And just on the Bill in Washington, HR7390 to essentially get rid of competitive bidding, I think they're having a lobbying event in your neck of the woods in California pretty soon. Do you have any thoughts on one, do you get involved in lobbying for this? Do you care? I mean, you care, but do you feel that it's worth your time to lobby for potentially adding more sponsors to this bill? I think they're up around 140 in terms of sponsors, so just any thoughts on that?
Kieran T. Gallahue: We feel it's important to support industry efforts that are geared towards recognizing the value that HMEs provide, the service that they provide to the industry, and to recognize the advantages that home care brings to the health care system. I mean, when we think about what health care systems around the globe are struggling with, they're trying to keep people out of a lot of these expensive hospital settings, but at the same time they're trying to manage chronic disorders and they're trying to get more predictive in care . Categories like the treatment of sleep disorder breathing or the use of adaptive server ventilation in treating heart failure that is big — we have a large study that is ongoing right now in Europe and we're very, very optimistic about the results that we expect to see in a couple of years in that category. Those things we think are important for people to know about. Now, we don't do a lot of direct lobbying, but we certainly support several industry groups that are engaged and are involved in getting the word out.
Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.: Great. Just two more followups, do you have any thoughts on the upcoming audit on prepayment rates as it concerns the CPAP that's coming out of Jurisdiction B? I think they're focused a little bit on the documentation requirements on the post-four month range, and I know you've got the compliance software on that front, but it's also going back and documenting they saw a doctor. Have you heard any — is that a concern at all, I guess, in terms of the —
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well, certainly not material, but let me throw it over to Dave Pendarvis.
David Pendarvis: Yeah, Peter. We're aware of it. We rely on these areas mostly on our HME partners. Obviously they're the ones who have to supply the appropriate documentation. This is a Medicare issue. It's not the overall issue, but it's our expectation that our customers have been following the proper paperwork, they've been getting the right forms now. In any situation when you're kind of putting in a new requirement there are always some slips and downs, but it's our expectation that by and large this won't have an impact on the operations. There might be some minor distraction to a particular customer who gets under an audit, but it's our expectation that the HMEs are compliant with all the requirements and there shouldn't be any long-term issues.
Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.:  Thanks. Maybe just one last one, any comments on Qnexa's data on sleep apnea? It's coming up for obesity approval, obviously it could have some off-label usage. And just on what their dataset compares to the gold standard here on CPAP and is it maybe an opportunity to copromote if these guys are maybe just going after mild candidates to just identify more sleep apnea patients?
David Pendarvis: Yeah. We obviously track developments on it in the pharmaceutical industry just as we track developments on the surgical area and device areas looking at potentially if there's any substitutes for something that can impact our markets in a positive or a negative way. As you know, there tends to be a lot more sizzle and noise then there tends to be depth when these early data come out, and so as we look at this now the idea that there's going to be a single drug that's going to cure obesity, I guess you can make your own bed on that. I'm not sure that that's a bed that I'd be comfortable making in the short term, but that's the basic focus that these guys are driving towards. We don't see, at this point, a risk and at this point we don't see a material opportunity for partnership. That being said, things do evolve and if we feel that it is appropriate, just as we've demonstrated with our alliances with LifeScan and alliances with Guidance when we were first entering the heart failure space, alliances with appropriate — Philips even when we're talking about public relations or we're talking about education. We're very comfortable with reaching out and finding mutual WIFMs, what's in it for me, in these cases. And if we see it we'll do it. But at this point I think we're comfortable in sort of a watching brief.
Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.:  All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Natalie Kelly with COMMSEC.
Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC: Thanks a lot. I was just wondering if you could give some color on any (inaudible) improvements that you're getting from your two recently released masks and also that you expect to get from the new S9 series?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yeah, great question. So as you know, when we enter an area that we're already in, I think a good example would be the Swift FX or the S9 which are basically replacements for existing products, and it's true with other products as well, but I think it's always easier to sort of calculate that delta on the things that exist. Our belief and our direction to the R&D team, and it's a very, very capable team, is to design products that can improve the feature sets, so it can improve the efficacy or improve the aesthetics or have some meaningful benefit to patients and to customers, but to do it at a lower cost basis. And that's particular enabled when you go through generational leaps.  When you go through the normal learning curve you certainly have some substantial benefits that you can provide, but when you do generational leaps, and I think a good example will be the S9, it gives you the ability to take advantage of developments that have occurred within the electronics industry as an example, or within the computing industry, or in the communications industry. And we can apply some of those improvements to new platforms. So absolutely, we will look at examples within the mask category, we will loo at examples within the flow generators, and I mention just two right off the top of my head. Both of those would represent opportunities for not only enhancement of performance, but also offer cost of goods reduction.
Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC: Great. And just one more question, just wondering what feedback you're getting from the DMA's intensive compliance levels? Are we starting to see compliance levels in the US sort of increase to European levels as the markets shift across to the APAPs and the BiPAPs, those higher end products just really sort of concerning those trends?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well it's always hard to give you accurate or specific figures on compliance and the reason is any HME you talk to is between 85%-95% compliant. They're always the best at it and it's the guy down the street that has the problem. But I will say that we feel comfortable that because of the change in the technology that is being used and because of the informatic capabilities of those devices — Mick mentioned before that customers and patients who have access to data and they engage in the use of that data, that it demonstrates a focus that improves compliance. And the nature of what we are delivering today and the increase in the number of auto set devices as an example, the use of ResTraxx as an example, and maybe even forgetting all those and just say the focus of the HME; understanding and knowing the importance of compliance and reinforcing of that, all of that leads to greater touch points with patients which will inevitably lead to higher compliance. So I think we can feel comfortable saying directionally it is moving in the right direction. I think it will be a little bit harder to get more specific on the numbers in the short term.
Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC: Thanks for that.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark so I will turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for his final remarks.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well great, thank you, everybody, for your time and attention. As always, we would like to thank our employees all over the globe in the various functions for their stellar efforts that drive ResMed's performance. I think you can see that in not only the results of this quarter, but you can see it in the product flow that we have begun launching throughout this year and the pipeline that we have to follow. So it's a very exciting time for ResMed. We're very pleased with the efforts and the results of the team throughout the globe and we look forward to updating you as we move into the next quarter. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator:  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is Marsha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the ResMed Incorporated Fiscal First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions).  The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the Company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may accessed through the Company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.
Kieran Gallahue: Thank you Marsha and good afternoon and welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call. I am certainly glad that we’re having it today and not competing with the New York Yankees and Joe Burke and the World Series celebration tomorrow.  As with our previous calls, I will begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then take your questions. We had another very solid quarter and we’re pleased to report that global revenue in the first quarter of 2010 grew 13%, or up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew by a very encouraging 19% year-over-year. The rest of the world revenue increased by 8%, but in constant currency terms it grew 13%. Europe and Asia Pac sales were quite solid this quarter. As in previous quarters currency had some effect on ROW revenue.  GAAP EPS increased a remarkable 53% to $0.55 per share. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles EPS was a penny better at $0.56 per share. We projected that we’d be able to sustain gross margins in the 60% to 62% range in the face of the strengthening Australian dollar and we are pleased to report that gross margin was in fact 60.8% in Q1 benefiting from favorable product mix due to an increase in sales of our high margin masks and high-end flow generators as well as continued success in leveraging manufacturing and logistics cost efficiencies across our global organization.  Again, we had a very strong performance in operating cash flow which came in at $64.1 million demonstrating our commitment to strong operating performance and earnings and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely solid with cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of Q1 of around $478 million. We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generator sales up 12%, or up 15% in constant currency and mass segments growing at a robust 15% during the quarter, a 17% increase on a constant currency basis.  Sales of Americas flow generators were up 14% year-over-year in Q1 and sales in ROW improved to 15% in constant currency terms. Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, once again led by the strong sales of our AutoSet category where we have a big advantage on noise and comfort. The whisper quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class. Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and is helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise. Once again we posted double-digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continue to increase market share. We believe we’re taking market share in both the new patient population and the install base. Mass sales were extremely strong this quarter and grew 23% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 8% in ROW. Mass sales in the Americas were strong across multiple segments, including excellent progress with our Mirage Quattro Full Face mask, our Mirage Activa LT nasal mask, and Swift LT and Swift LT for Her nasal pillow interfaces. With their ease of use they are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace. As a reminder, these redesigned LT masks are smaller, lighter, and more streamlined versions of their predecessors and the Activa LT is a less obtrusive mask which gives patients superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. With these new masks in the global marketplace we remained focused on growing market share with high margin, industry-leading products. To add to our offerings of small lightweight masks we recently launched the Swift FX nasal pillow mask in Europe, our lightest mask to date. We also just launched our first ever gel mask with the Mirage SoftGel. We showed the mask at Medtrade and have had a fabulous response both at the show and in our early days of the market.  In October we announced that we acquired Laboratoires Narval. Based in France Narval manufactures and distributes the Narval ORM, an innovative mandibular repositioning device that offers a solution to patients for snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea. With this acquisition we add another therapy to complement our existing positive airway pressure based solutions. In the near term we plan to commercialize this device primarily in France where it is presently the only device with established reimbursement. Over time we will evaluate other markets and expand into other geographies as it makes sense. Last March we indicated that we would have a very active 18 or so months of product launches. As you can see from the past few months we are well on track to meeting that commitment. As noted earlier we began taking orders for the SoftGel mask in the US during October and we’ll commence product shipments, in fact we have commenced product shipments, in November. In addition, we launched the Swift FX in Europe during October. We expect that each of these products will be launched on a global basis over the course of the remainder of this fiscal year. Additionally, in July, as promised, we introduced the ApneaLinkTM plus our type III home diagnostic device that meets the existing reimbursement and physician requirements.  As we have been saying this year, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms. It was proven that home sleep testing was here to stay in calendar year 2008 and in calendar year 2009, as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models. We are working closely with our sleep physician partners to make home testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. We also expect growth results from continued and improved awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays in the very serious, most rapidly growing, and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders, and races, it’s becoming widely recognized that hear disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disorder breathing and that treatments for sleep disorder breathing could not only improve health, but may also dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations. We also know that SDB can have a substantial effect on presenteeism, as well as absenteeism and represents a big opportunity with occupational health and safety in the transportation business for diagnoses and treatment of sleep disorder breathing.  It seems almost sadly routine that we hear of airline or trucking mishaps that are linked to sleep issues. In addition, just recently the US National Safety Board stepped up its campaign to test all drivers for sleep apnea. The NTSB has written to the US Coast Guard and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration recommending screening for all pilots, bus, and truck drivers for sleep apnea. The NTSB recommendation follows a string of transport accidents in which sleep apnea was identified as a factor in driver and pilot performance. Finally, as part of our strategy to improve awareness of sleep disorder breathing in the physician community we are embarking on a series of branded and unbranded medical education programs. In fact, we just announced the collaboration with Phillips to support the sleep communities efforts to educate primary care physicians funded with educational grants. This is just a part of our continued commitment to raising the awareness of the dangers of sleep disorder breathing within the medical community. In summary, Q1, once again, demonstrated the strength of our global reach and balanced business while providing very positive signals for sustained industry growth and ResMed growth as we look forward. Now I will turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the financials and then we’ll take your questions. Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Kieran. I will just briefly run through our September quarter results. Just to recap our revenues for the September quarter were $247 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year quarter and as expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our first quarter revenues by approximately $5.3 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.  Our income from operations for the quarter is $52.7 million, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $42.1 million, an increase of 50% over the prior year quarter.  On a diluted earnings per share basis for the quarter it was $0.55, an increase of 53% over the prior year quarter. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 60.8%, down sequentially from Q4 ‘09. We did benefit from favorable product mix, but this was offset by unfavorable currency impact and some unfavorable geographic mix. Looking forward, the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar will have a negative impact upon our gross margin, however assuming current exchange rates we still expect our gross margin to be around 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2010. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $76.8 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A increased by $0.11 over the prior year quarter. The increase in SG&A reflects expenses to support sales growth as well as activities targeting the increasing awareness and diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 31% compared to the year ago figure of 33%. Looking forward, and again, subject to currency movements we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 31% for the balance of fiscal year 2010. R&D expenses for the quarter were $70.9 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 8% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for the balance of fiscal year 2010. We continue to devote significant resources to [inaudible] innovation and clinical study activities. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.8 million for the quarter and stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $6.5 million. During the quarter we also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3% and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate will be in the vicinity of 27%. Turning now to revenues in more detail: Overall Americas sales were $134.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks with strong contributions from our high-end APAP devices, new range of bi-levels and the full-face masks. So that side of the Americas totaled $112.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. As expected, sales outside of the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particular the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out the revenues between product segments, in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 14% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 23%. For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 15%, while masks and other increased by 8%. On a group basis in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 15%, while masks and other increased by 17%. Now cash flow from operations was $64.1 million for the quarter reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. In the next quarter our operating cash flow will be significantly impacted by an expected Australian tax payment traditionally made in the calendar fourth quarter; it should return to robust levels after that. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $14.1 million, including $4.3 million in completion costs associated with our new global headquarters in San Diego. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $14.1 million.  We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 789,000 shares for consideration of $35.7 million as part of our ongoing buy back program. As of today, we have repurchased 994,000 shares out of a total authorized buy back of 10 million shares.  Our balance sheet remains strong and conservatively at September 30 total assets stood at $1.6 billion and net equities $1.2 billion. Group external debt was $163 million, while cash and cash equivalents totaled $478 million. I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran Gallahue:  All right, thanks Brett and Marsha we will now open the call up for questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray:  I was hoping you could give us some color on your ROW performance. We saw a pretty nice acceleration here, what was driving that and should we expect that to continue?
Kieran Gallahue: It was really a balanced performance across the ROW regions. You’ve seen that the last couple of quarters, we have had some strong performance and I just think the team has a lot of good things going for it right now. It is executing extremely well. The leadership teams under Stein Jacobsen and under Rob Douglas are both performing extremely well. The product line up is very well suited to the marketplace and stacks up well from the perspective of competitive alternatives. So, all in all I think it is no silver bullet here, it is not just one single item, it is strong performance across multiple geographies and we’re feeling good about their performance.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay and then can you give us your take on, there was a launch by a competitor of yours and I’m just wondering If you are seeing any kind of impact in the field from that and maybe your take on how you’re line up stacks up against their refreshed line up.
Kieran Gallahue: You are speaking specifically about the launch of flow generator series by our primary competitor and so to date I am not hearing a whole lot. I mean obviously any new product is going to get trial and there is going to be a lot of sort of conversations around the products. I will say that we are mainly hearing back from customers is the feeling that it is an attempt to compete with the SA II, to try to basically play catch up with that product series.  There are a couple of nice features that we appreciate which is some investment in algorhythms and informatics, which we think is good for the industry. Overall, I would say the summary is there are some feature sets in there which will be good for raising the awareness of the industry; it is good to have more than one player that is focusing on some of these high end algorhythms, but when you look at our product line up versus the competitive, I guess my summary would be we remain very comfortable with our product line up and we remain even more comfortable with our product pipeline. 
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Brett, can you give us the foreign exchange impact on EPS?
Brett Sandercock:  It is round about the $0.05 to $0.06 mark positive there. It is worth noting though, even if you sort of strip that out we still had a really strong quarter. We would have growth on EPS of over 35% even without that sort of currency impact. But, overall that was sort of the region of the impact. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse: I want to ask you about competitive bidding in the US. We are seeing some updates coming out of CMS the processes that kicked off. I would like your thoughts on the outlook for the Medicare part of your business in terms of price.
Kieran Gallahue: Again, just a sort of benchmark here, just a reminder, from a global sales perspective we estimated somewhere around 10% of the global sales that are associated with US Medicare related patients, so that is point one.  Point two, no real surprises. I mean the updates that have been provided over the last year about how this thing is going to roll out; the fact that they have moved it from 10 MSAs down to 9 MSAs, just really there are no changes. There is obviously a lot of activity at the HME level; they have been working on it for a number of months, although not a lot of chatter at if from a customer perspective. If I compare this to two years ago and the amount of chatter when it was the first time through, I think there was almost sort of a feeling of panic. This time it is much more of a businessman like sort of approach to it. They kind of know the drill and they are going to go through it.  It is still unclear, even after the betting, what’s going to happen. If it continues to roll through it doesn’t get impacted for what another year, 14 months, as we get into calendar year 2011, and no clear understanding about whether it will roll out after that. My summary would be business as usual at this point.
Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse: Then I would like to hear your thoughts on US healthcare reform and particularly in regards to the medical device industry. Have there been any updates since we spoke last week and what is your expectation around the final build of the merge?
Kieran Gallahue: That would be one for Las Vegas, I think, at this point. As you know those bills are all over the place and our feeling is you just step back and you look at it and you say what are the fundamentals that they are trying to drive towards and to the extent that there is an attempt to try to become more efficient in healthcare, the extent that there is a desire to increase the access to bring more patients into the system, both of those trends actually could be very positive from our perspective. Certainly by increasing the number of covered lives, sleep disorder breathing is a disorder that affects people of all walks and all sorts of economic classes; in fact you could argue that those in some of the areas that they are not being covered today by insurance may have the highest prevalence rates.  You also have the opportunity to look a bit more holistically at the cost of care and it is very clear that hospital systems around the planet, not just in the US, are trying to keep people out of hospitals, trying to keep them out of acute care settings, and trying to manage them in a more cost effective way. They are also trying to deal with the rising costs of managing chronic disorders.  You look at sleep disorder breathing; we are sitting in the middle of some of the most costly co morbidities, or chronic disorders on the planet. We have a very cost effective way of helping to treat patients and increasing access for patients can only be a good thing. I think the best proof statement on that is if you look at the National Institute of Clinical Excellence that supports the National Health System in the UK. I mean, you can argue that the UK is one of the more frugal healthcare environments on the planet and they have some very good outcomes data as well. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence has really been sort of the granddaddy of health economic bodies around the globe and 18 months ago they analyzed the sleep apnea space and their recommendation was that it was cost and official in order to identify and treat more patients with sleep disorder breathing. So, when you look at those kinds of indicators and you say if we move anywhere in the direction towards that level of frugality and then there is some common sense put in place as NICE has demonstrated, there could be some very positive aspects that come out of this. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joshua Zable from Natixis Bleichroeder.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: I know you broke out the US generators in mass on a constant currency basis, but can you give us the numbers for everyone’s models?
Brett Sandercock: For the US the flow gens was $64.8 million, masks and other was $69.9; Tiger $34.7; for the rest of the world flow gens was $75.8; masks and other $36.5, for $112.3 total.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Perfect and then on the gross margin I know you gave a range, you sort of talked about 60%, just because I know there is a lot of stuff going on with gross margins as far as product mix and the new products higher and currency, I mean from this range should we sort of see it dip first and then come back up, should it be kind of constant over the year, can you just give us any color on how we should think about it? I know you guys don’t like to give quarterly guidance, but kind of moves it around a lot just to give us some sort of gauge?
Brett Sandercock: As you said there is a lot of things impacting on the geographic mix, the product mix, new product releases and so on and then obviously currency as well. If you look at it, we get benefit from the euro, which has been appreciating at the moment, so that is going to help us and I hope it is on a headline basis in terms of revenue as well. The Aussie dollar depreciating will hurt us also and that has been coming from a low, probably around six months ago, of about $0.66 and it has been steadily climbing through the quarters. We felt some of that impact clearly this quarter. We will feel some more of the impact through Q2 and it will still be manifesting in Q3 as well, but then I would expect that that would then start to improve as we went through Q4 and we’re pretty much through those sort of year-on-year currency impact. So you think of it like that, if that makes sense.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Yes, no that is actually very, very helpful.
Kieran Gallahue: Part of that is you get sort of the temporary effects on the currency side, but the lasting effects are the things that are associated with product mix, with new product flow, with operational improvements that we’ve been engaging in throughout the globe and structural changes such as increasing manufacturing in our Singapore facility. So there is sort of the temporary sort of things that are really hard to forecast and then there are the longer trend items that are quite positive for us.
Brett Sandercock: That is exactly right and we have been working hard on the cost initiative on the manufacturing and so on. You guys know that we did move to Singapore, we established a factory there to enhance the factory down here in Sydney, so there is a lot of activity that goes on beneath the surface here that we’ll continue to work on, really just a sustained reduction in that overall cost base and we will continue to do that and new products, obviously, will help as well.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay great and then Kieran I know you commented about the competitive launch and I know you don’t want to knock the products and you made your comments already, but I am just wondering have you really seen them out there yet/ I know typically when Respironics launch it is some sort of limited release and I am just wondering obviously they are still sampling in that limited release, but have you really seen it out there yet to the point that your guys could come back and evaluate, or it is not really out there yet and it is just sort of trickling into the market?
Kieran Gallahue: I think, as you noted at Medtrade, I think they did an excellent job, as they always do, in trying to establish awareness about the new product flow and I’m sure that transcends into the sales force and into their call patterns. You are absolutely right that any product launch from any competitor or from ResMed for that matter, you go through a process where you get an initial trial and then the real question mark is after that initial trial what are your reorder rates like and then how does it stack up competitively. At the same time you have sort of a push through of some of the older inventory that you try to make sure that you don’t get caught with any obsolescence on that.  So, I would expect since the launch and for a few months that there will be sort of that blend of their new product coming in, cleaning out the old inventory, and what not. But, the awareness is there, there is no doubt. I have a lot of respect for them and their communication capabilities and there is no doubt that there should be very few customers that don’t know about that new product yet.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Pricing is being maintained while they’ve launched their new product?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, I will say that from the beginning of the integration of the Respironics and the Phillips team we’ve felt they’ve been very good competitors. I think we all recognize that there is tremendous amount of value that is brought to bear and I won’t limit that to Respironics, I will say that throughout the industry that there is a tremendous amount of value that we bring to customers and I think we all know that price competition is a short-term gain and that we all need to be focusing on higher value opportunities and how to reduce the costs to our customers. You reduce the costs by simplifying their supply chain. You reduce the costs by helping to drive more volume into the marketplace. You reduce the cost by this focus on informatics or algorhythms or what not. That is why we, at this point, feel pretty comfortable with the state of where the industry is at.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder:   My ResMed count down clock to your new generator launch is hitting 9 months now I think. Is that correct, are we on time with that or do I need to change it?
Kieran Gallahue: We said the beginning of last March that we were going to have a very active 18 months or so of product launches and the team has done a very good job of living up to that. We started in the first quarter with the ApneaLinkTM plus, we now have the Swift FX which was launched in Europe and before the end of this fiscal year we’ll be global. We’ve got the gel product which has only been launched in the US and we expect that before the end of the fiscal year it will be launched on a global basis and certainly we have noted that we have a flow generator platform coming, but for competitive reasons and for customer reasons it is simply not appropriate for us to get specific on the timing.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Peter Bye from Jefferies & Co.
Joshua Jennings - Jefferies & Co.: It is actually Josh Jennings in for Peter who is traveling today. Could you give a little bit more color in terms of the home sleep testing pilots that are ongoing in terms of maybe numbers and how they are faring? Then when do you expect home sleep diagnostics to become more of a meaningful impact to your sales base?
Kieran Gallahue:  First of all I think there are certain home sleep testing pilots that we’re involved with and there are many that are ongoing that are really led by the customers themselves and experimenting. So, as we expected throughout this year there is going to be activity really across a wide range of customer types. Seeing primary care physicians try their hand at it, the independent diagnostic testing facilities, or the IDTFs that are getting involved, sleep physicians, other types of specialists, so there are a number of different types of customers or healthcare providers that are getting involved in understanding what their role in home sleep testing could be, or should be, and you are almost seeing the first echo, if you will, in that process where there has been a learning and an iteration in it.  What I mean by that is there are certain groups that seem particularly interested in it and I would say the IDTFs working with the HMEs seem particularly interested and capable of providing support and very encouragingly we see more and more sleep physicians, who we certainly enjoy working with in this category, who are beginning to understand the benefit of integrating home sleep testing along with their traditional diagnostic techniques. And, you see many of the sleep physicians who maybe a few months ago, and I mean that literally, just a few months ago may have been quite reticent to think about the adoption are beginning to learn a bit more, experiment a bit more, and to gain substantially more comfort with the idea of home sleep testing in their professional hands being able to be administered quite well and in a quite balanced way. In addition, you are seeing more and more payers get engaged in this. We, on a regular basis, get feedback from payers, local payers, national payers, of their interest in either supporting customers that have been working in home sleep testing or somehow encouraging the use of home sleep testing and much of this we get from feedback from the physicians themselves who have been working with those payers.  So, it is progressing. I would say that the effect on results to date is not yet material. We hadn’t expected it to be material and in fact is not material and that is sort of the way that you would expect these things to roll out, which is to have people gain comfort, understand the three Ps, process, payment and politics. The process and payment have been progressing quite well. Then as I note that the politics, which were probably a bit more intense six, nine months ago, are beginning to ease a bit, but certainly by no means have disappeared and I wouldn’t expect that to happen over night. So, good progress and I would say nothing has happened yet that is different than we had anticipated and articulated certainly earlier in the year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Your Americas number is on supplier. I know you are introducing some new products there, but is there anything else that helped shift that quarter?
Kieran Gallahue: The US organization under J.C. [Corellas] and supported by our SBU leaders, Farrell and Don Darkin have been just doing an excellent job of continually improving the experience that we have with our customers, trying to make it easier to do business with ResMed. They have an excellent product line up and an excellent team.  Again, I will say just as I said with the ROW piece, it is not one silver bullet. It is execution across multiple areas and they are just doing a great job.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, you have a nice amount of cash building on the balance sheet, other than stock repurchases what should we think about uses for that cash?
Kieran Gallahue: We do have a very strong balance sheet. It is one that we are proud of and certainly one that has held us in very good position throughout this last year and allowed us to focus on our business and growing the business and growing awareness and continuing to fund our product pipeline where perhaps other businesses needed to spend time worrying about their financial condition. We have traditionally been a conservatively geared company and we feel very good about continuing that process. We will selectively look at opportunities to invest those dollars. I think a good example of that was the Narval acquisition that we completed in this last quarter, which is our first sort of toe in the water and to a complimentary therapy to pap and one that we feel very good about and the execution of that French team, which by the way has already begun its integration; an excellent team and one that we welcome with open arms into the ResMed team. We also had the opportunity to buy back our own stock and that continued too, as Brett noted, another $35 million was invested in this last quarter and that is on top of a substantial amount of share buybacks over the last 18 months, because we feel that ResMed was a very worthy investment.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: With this shift in foreign exchange environment, does it make sense to change your head in policies?
Brett Sandercock: What has happened over the last two or three years is in fact volatility on exchange movements increased significantly really. I think that you still need to continue to hedge and I think you look at what you do there within derivatives. I mean we take it pretty simple. The majority is options, for example, where you are not impacted; you are not going to lose your premiums sort of thing. We hedged the cash flows coming back to the factory and then we looked to naturally hedge a lot of our exposures around the group as well, just basically leveraging our global reach, I suppose, so we do a lot of that natural hedging as well.  And we do spend time looking at where our international revenues are and where our international expenses are and how balanced they are and they are reasonably well balanced; so you end up looking to hedge relative out performance or under performance of some of the major currencies such as the euro and the Aussie, but I still think there is a place for hedging, but you just have to do it in a very measured way and really look for natural hedging and offsets where ever you can and just use that global base to your advantage. I think so far we have done pretty well. We managed a high currency environment, low currency environment, and still generated great results over many years.  
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Matson from Wells Fargo Securities.
Michael Matson -Wells Fargo Securities:  I know you have talked quite a bit about the positive impact you’ve seen from Medicare’s compliance requirements, given that you are probably selling more of the ResTraxx units and things like that. But, when I was at Medtrade I did hear some chatter from some of the HMEs about having problems getting the Medicare patients to A. show that they are compliant and B. go back for that follow up visit that they’re required to do. Is there any risk that that could actually turn into a negative to the degree that those folks don’t end up being compliant and the HME pulls that equipment back and then gives it to a new patient thereby trimming the demand for new equipment?
Kieran Gallahue: I think that the key here is that the opportunity for improving compliance has always existed. What the Medicare ruling did was to focus the HMEs very strongly on the opportunity to improve compliance, and that is something that we have long wanted for many, many different reasons. One, because that is the only way you help the patient, that is the primary reason. We are here to help support healthcare providers in helping patients. But, it is also good business because a compliant user obviously over time represents a renewal stream for many years of very high value products.  The idea of the ResTraxx types of units in the world is to help solve the problem. It is to be able to help those HMEs be more efficient in the way that they address the opportunities of improving compliance. It is a management by exception tool. So, we don’t expect the challenges associated with the compliance to ever fully go away. That is why HMEs play such an important role in the channel. They are service providers and payers need to recognize the value that those HMEs are bringing to patients.  Our job is to provide technology enablement that allows them, whenever possible, to either lessen the labor that is involved in getting patients compliant, or deskill the labor that is being applied to it. Many, many of the things that we do, regardless of whether it is Medicare or non-Medicare, because everyone has the same opportunity for improvement. So, whether it is ResTraxx and this fantastic management by exception tool; whether it is the Easy Breeze wave form and designing wave forms that are more comfortable for patients; whether it is EPR and having the ability to make the introduction to therapy more comfortable; whether it is the wide range of masks that we provide, everything from nasal pillows to full face masks; from liquid silicone rubber all the way over to gel masks now; it is all about making the experience better for the patient and we believe in the long run the healthcare providers, the payers, including Medicare, win in that process and the HMEs will win in that process. I think we think that the focusing that Medicare has done could always create a few bumps in the road, but net, net it should be a positive for this industry.
Michael Matson -Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, so you see a positive factor of compliant patients replacing masks more frequently and also more sales of the ResTraxx units sort of offsetting a kind of negative factor of some patients kind of giving up their equipment and having that come back into the pool?
Kieran Gallahue: Look, first of all ResTraxx is an enabler, so it is not a huge revenue driver, or a profit driver. We provide that mostly as a service to our HMEs to help them become more efficient, but when push comes to shove in this industry it is about creating awareness and it is about engaging healthcare providers, including across all the various medical silos and right down to the primary care physicians and most importantly it is about providing the support to those patients, because when they get treated we all know, and the data has shown, that their healthcare costs get reduced holistically. The improvements in cardiovascular disease, and the improvements in diabetes, we talked about occupational health and safety and the danger of these truckers when they are not treated appropriately. We read about these pilots that over shoot airports like in the Go Airlines case. There are a lot of opportunities for well treated patients, when they have sleep disorder breathing, to be able to reduce healthcare costs overall, including if you want to look at it on a micro basis, or if you want to look at it on a macro basis.
Michael Matson -Wells Fargo Securities: Okay and then can you just quantify what the impact of currency was to your bottom line, to your EPS number this quarter? It sounded like it was pretty minimal, but…
Brett Sandercock: On the EPS it is around $0.05 or $0.06, including there is some hedging gain as well. 
Kieran Gallahue: As Brett noted, even if you back that out the EPS was still up over 35%.
Michael Matson -Wells Fargo Securities: It looked like your international mass growth even on a constant currency basis was a little bit on the weak side. I am just wondering if you have really started to see the impact from the Swift FX or did that kind of come later in the quarter, or even after the quarter, so it didn’t really have an effect?
Kieran Gallahue: Swift FX really was not material in those results and just as the question that came up before about the impact of new products, whether it is us or others you don’t tend to see the full impact in that first quarter over time, it tends to grow over time, but just in general it is not unusual for two things to be on the ROW mass line and I know you have tracked us for awhile, which is A. in general it tends to grow slower than the US line items and there tends to be a little bit more lumpiness on the ROW line items than you will see in the Americas.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Natalie Kelly from CommSec.
Natalie Kelly - CommSec:  Looking in the past you seem to have made several vertical acquisitions picking up quite a few independent distribution companies, whereas the Narval acquisition seemed to be a little bit of a shift for you. I am just wondering whether you see many opportunities sort of in this space of complimentary therapy?
Kieran Gallahue: You are right we have actually done both. We have done acquisitions within the channel. The latest one was our Indian distributor as an example and we have also done acquisitions of technology where we believe it’s strategic. Two examples would be the motor business that now under pins so much of the innovation that we’re capable of. Other examples would be the ventilation business in France and now, of course, this Narval, as you noted. To answer your question, we are broadly about complimentary technologies. We are very open-minded when we look at opportunities in the marketplace. We strongly believe that we’re here to serve patients and patient care and that it is not unlikely over time that more than one solution can be appropriate. With that said, I will say we have never seen anything that is as efficacious and as safe as positive airway pressure CPAP and APAP, but that is a whole PAP therapy and that remains, we believe, the gold standard and we believe to be the core of the opportunity in treating sleep disorder breathing patients. But, we absolutely keep our eyes open for other opportunities, but we are data driven. We look at these solutions and we want to see opportunities where it is demonstrated that it helps patients. We want to see opportunities to see that it is good medicine, that it is something that’s acceptable by the medical community and acceptable by our standards for patient care. We also need to see a pathway to profitability with those. We need to see where ResMed can benefit from investing our time and attention and that. So, those are some pretty high hurdles, but every now and again there is a company, or a technology, that that makes sense and quite fortunately we have the resources to be able to take advantage of those when we see them. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Stanton from RBS.
David Stanton - RBS: Can you give us an update on home diagnosis and whether you think the volume of diagnosis, particularly in the US, is increasing due to this?
Kieran Gallahue:  At this point the net net answer is we do not believe there is a material impact yet from home sleep testing. That is totally consistent where we thought this would be at this point. This is really the year of piloting. It is the year where the three Ps are being worked out, the payment, the process, and the political situation that surrounds home sleep testing. There has been substantial movement forward as various healthcare providers that range from IDTFs to sleep physicians, to HMEs, to primary care physicians, each of those areas have had certain players that have experimented or are experimenting with home sleep testing and over time we would expect the smoke to clear and there to be certainly more than one solution that will be in the marketplace that is associated with home sleep testing. So, it is progressing quite well. I think as we look out over the future we still believe that home sleep testing has the potential to have a very major effect on this marketplace over time and as we have been saying and we continue to believe we don’t believe that is a one night or an over night kind of process, it is the kind of thing that gets introduced and grows over time and signals very positively for the long-term health of this industry.
David Stanton - RBS: Have you gotten any feedback from home sleep doctors, in particular, that they can make good money out of home sleep testing at the moment compared to further investment in the sleep labs and perhaps they are?
Kieran Gallahue: Over the last couple of months there has been a reasonably significant shift in many of the conversations where sleep physicians are approaching us and whereas they may have been a bit concerned, or more concerned maybe nine months ago, typically with either the economics or the politics associated with it, they seem to be getting to a point where many more of them are getting more comfortable with the idea of integrating home sleep testing. Some of them are a bit more advanced than others. We certainly have some of our customers which have said they’ve been able to grow their business by using home sleep testing and the way that they are viewing it is, and again it varies by the individual, but is looking at many of the patients who, for whatever reason, may not show up at the lab, so they get a referral into the sleep lab. A good 30% of those patients historically have never showed up.  Clearly some of those people either are not showing up either because of the expense or because of the inconvenience associated with the over night sleep test. 70% do show up, but 3% is a big number and so you have some of those sleep physicians who are looking at that and saying hey, this is not a matter of replacing somebody who would have been in a bed anyway, this is a matter of getting somebody who we would not have been able to reach. So, it is truly a new patient or an incremental patient that they wouldn’t have been able to reach. In addition, what they are finding is that some of those patients, once they test them with the home sleep testing device, still require either because they are borderline, or because there is something very unusual about them, they still require a full PSG. So, those are the ones that are getting more comfortable more quickly and obviously you’ll have some of those faster movers in the marketplace and you will have some that will lag behind that and may take a bit longer to feel comfortable and may need to see the sleep physician across town and see how they have adopted it before they feel comfortable in the adoption phase. It is a very interesting process that they are going through, but the more data they get it seems the more comfortable they get.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jason Mills from Canaccord Adams.
Jamar Ismail - Canaccord Adams:  This is Jamar for Jason. First on the EPS effect for foreign exchange, what are you guys thinking about in the upcoming quarters? I mean $0.05 to $0.06 is fairly high this quarter and going forward talking about different hedging strategies do you see the same effect next quarter or a little bit lower?
Brett Sandercock: If you look at this quarter we are in the Q1 we had a positive impact there. As the country swings around particularly the Aussie and it works its way through inventory into our cost of sales, I would expect the next quarter, for example, you are probably looking around $0.04 or $0.05 negative impact on EPS all things being equal.
Jamar Ismail - Canaccord Adams: Okay changing gears to the US market, you talked a little bit about the US market being a little bit lower than you had seen in the past. What are you thinking now?
Kieran Gallahue: We haven’t really seen a significant change in these last nine months. So, you need to go back to the beginning of the year and as we said at the time we thought that maybe there was a couple of points that were shaved off, but it was still double-digit growth on the revenue side and the volume side was still close to that range of around the 15% or so. We continue to feel that the market is growing at quite a healthy clip. Then when we look at the fundamentals of awareness building, of diagnostics simplification, about just in general look at the various very positive signals in this marketplace, it still looks very, very good. So, we remain very, very comfortable about the marketplace. We continue to invest both in the short term and the long term because you don’t take market growth for granted, so these efforts on the industry side to raise awareness and educate primary care physicians are very important. The advent of home sleep testing is very important. This just flood of data that continues on the link between sleep disorder breathing and heart failure, and cardiovascular disease and diabetes is just very, very encouraging as we look out over the medium and the long term in market expansion. 
Operator:  Your last question comes from Dan Hearn from UBS.
Dan Hearn - UBS: The trend that you are seeing with the mix shift toward the higher end of [inaudible] and the flow generators, is that a trend that is slowing, or stable, or accelerating?
Kieran Gallahue: We see a continued trend it is certainly not slowing. There was a period there were it was accelerating and it continues to grow above market rates, so let’s just call it a stable, continuing positive shift mix that we’ve seen in this industry. Again, I think that bodes well for the future, because many of these higher end feature sets are oriented towards patient comfort, which can improve compliance, and they are oriented towards the reduction of labor that ‘s required by the HME or the sleep physician in helping patients get acclimated to their therapies.  So, good, solid, positive trends and they continue.
Kieran Gallahue:  Thank you everybody for your participation in this call. As always I want to thank our employees all over the globe in their various functions, because once again, these results are the result of their passion and their hard work and their efforts. So, fantastic job by the ResMed team across the globe.  I can tell you this that we on the back of a fantastic Q1 we remain excited about our future. We have high margin exciting new products that are rolling out over the year. The market for sleep disorder breathing is still highly under penetrated. We have new policies that are simplifying the diagnostic process. We have a stellar balance sheet, significant operating cash flow, and as I noted we have an absolutely stellar team. Thank you very much for your attention and we look forward to continuing to update you as we move through the fiscal year. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. (Operator Instructions).

===== 2009 Q4  (2009-08-06 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Kieran Gallahue – President and CEO Brett Sandercock – CFO

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2009 ResMed earnings conference call. I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator instructions) The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projection of future revenue of earnings, new product developments or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which maybe accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.
Kieran Gallahue: Thank you. Well, good afternoon and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. As with our previous calls, I'm begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then both take your questions. Well, as any of you that have seen the press release, you know the we had another very solid quarter and a phenomenal year that once again demonstrated the power of being a well balanced, geographically diversified company with a well accepted, high quality diverse mix of products. We are pleased to report the global revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 grew 7%, or up 15% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in the Americas grew by 20% year-over-year. ROW revenue declined by 4% but in constant currency terms grew 10%. As expected, currency had a significant effect on ROW revenue. For the year, we are approaching that billion dollar mark with 921 million in global revenue. GAAP EPS increased a remarkable 55% to $0.59. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was $0.02 better at $0.61. We projected that we would be able to grow gross margin and are pleased to report that gross margin improved over 62% in Q4, benefiting from the depreciation of the Australian dollar from last year's highs, and increase in sales of our higher margin masks, sales of high-end flow generators as well as continued success in leveraging cost efficiencies across our global organization. Again we had very strong performance in operating cash flow, which came in at $70.2 million demonstrating our commitment to strong operating performance and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q4 of about $416 million. We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generators up 8% or 17% in constant currency, and mask segments growing at 6% during the quarter, an 11% increase on a constant currency basis. We saw significant growth in the profitable segments of our flow generators. Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, especially the S8 AutoSet II and VPAP Auto 25 where we had a big advantage in both noise and in comfort. Our Easy-Breathe technology is now available across the entire sleep device platforms from CPAP to APAP and through to our VPAP SV devices. The whisper-quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class. Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and it's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise. Sales of America’s flow generators were up 22% year-over-year in Q4 and sales in ROW improved to 30% in constant currency terms. As a result of changing product mix in the sleep device category towards higher-end technology, our gross margins are improving. There continued to be tremendous interest in our wireless compliance technology, ResTracks GSM. We still remain the only company that provides wireless transfer of sleep apnea data to an Internet system. Once again we posted double digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continue to increase market share. We believe we are taking market share in both the new patient population and the installed base. Mask sales grew 18% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 4% in ROW. Mask sales in the Americas were strong across all product lines, with our full face masks, such as the Mirage Quattro contributing significantly, but also Mirage Activa LT, the Swift LT and Swift LT for Her doing particularly well. With their ease of use they are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace. As a reminder, these redesigned LT masks are smaller, lighter and more streamlined versions of their predecessors. The Swift LT for Her product fills a gender need and space not addressed by other companies. We listened to the voice of the customer and we responded. And the Activa LT is a less obtrusive mask, which gives patients superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. With these new masks in the global marketplace, we remain focused on growing market share with high margin industry leading products. Looking forward over the next 12 months, we plan to launch a series of new masks and flow generators. In July as promised, we introduced the ApneaLink Plus, our type three home diagnostic device that will meet the existing reimbursement and physician requirements. As we have been saying this year, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms. It was proven that HST was here to stay in 2008 and in 2009 as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models. We are working closely with our sleep physician partners to make home testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. We also expect growth to result from continued and improved awareness in validation of the critical role that sleep disordered breathing plays in a very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although sleep disordered breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races it is becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disordered breathing, and treatments for sleep disordered breathing can not only improve health, but dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations. I think that point deserves more thought and consideration. It is well known that government and payers across the globe are looking to reduce healthcare costs, while improving outcomes. Let us remember that NICE, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which is the UK health economic experts, just over a year ago, released the results of their evaluation of sleep disordered breathing. The net outcome, NICE concluded that it is economically advantageous to identify and treat patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. Given that countries around the globe are looking to develop similar healthcare economic analysis arms, many based on the model that NICE established, this bodes well for ResMed and for the sleep industry moving forward. We also know that sleep disordered breathing can have a dramatic effect on presenteeism as well as absenteeism and represents a significant opportunity with occupational health and safety in the transportation business for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing. As a matter of fact, there was the story just recently that pilots on a Go Airlines flight from Honolulu overflow the international airport by 50 km last year because the pilots fell asleep. The US National Safety Board confirmed an initial finding a few weeks ago that the captain and first officer inadvertently fell asleep, while the plane was on autopilot. The board said that the contributing factor was the captain's previously undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea. This focus on occupational health and safety and the comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are still in their early days of impact. The data is compelling and we have not yet began to feel the full impact on this industry. This market remains highly under penetrated, a fact that bodes well for the future growth prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the financials and then we will take your questions. Brett.
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Kieran. Let's briefly run through our June quarter results. As Kieran mentioned, revenue for the June quarter was 252 million, which is an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. As expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our fourth quarter revenues by approximately 17.3 million. So in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15% over the prior year quarter. Income from operations for the quarter was 57.9 million, an increase of 57% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was 45.4 million, an increase of 53% over the prior year quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.2%, up sequentially from Q3, reflecting favorable currency impact, and traction from our manufacturing and supply chain improvement initiatives. Our fourth-quarter gross margin now reflects the full benefits associated with this initiation of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. As you look forward, should the more recent appreciation of the Australian dollar be sustained, we will have a negative impact on our gross margins over the course of fiscal year 2010. However, subject to further currency volatility, we still expect our gross margin to be broadly in the range of 60% to 62% over the course of fiscal year 2010. SG&A expenses for the quarter were 77.6 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. The flat price in headline SG&A expenses reflects the impact of the depreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 31%, compared to the year ago figure of 33%. Looking forward, and again subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 31% to 33% for fiscal year 2010. R&D expenses for the quarter were 17 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. The lower R&D expense reflects the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar as the majority of our R&D expenditure is denominated in Australian dollars. In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 7%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for fiscal year 2010. We continue to devote significant resources to product innovation and clinical study activities. Amortization of acquired intangibles was 1.8 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 6.6 million. During the quarter, we also had donated 2.5 million for the ResMed Foundation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in this vicinity of 27% as well. Turning now to revenues in more detail, overall America’s sales were 134.2 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks with strong contributions from our high-end CPAP and IPAP devices, our new range of bilevels and Swift and Quattro mask ranges. Sales outside of the Americas totaled 117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. As expected sales outside the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particular depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. If you break those revenues up by product segments Americas flow generator sales increased by 22% while masks and others increased by 18%. For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 13% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 4%. On a global basis in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 17%, while masks and other increased by 11%. Cash flow from operations was 70.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.8 million, including 9.8 million in building construction and fit out costs for our new global headquarters in San Diego. I am pleased to note that the building was completed on schedule and within budget, and we have relocated to our new headquarters on May 11, 2009. There is approximately 4 million in payments remaining on the building and they should be paid during our first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled 14.9 million. We continue to buyback shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 349,000 shares, a consideration of 13 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. For fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at a cost of 65.7 million. During the June quarter, our board of directors authorized a share buyback program for up to 10 million shares and this buyback program replaces our previous program. As of today, we have repurchased 79,000 shares out of the new total approved buyback of 10 million shares. ResMed ended fiscal year 2009 in excellent financial shape. Revenues for the year were a record 920.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year or a 15% increase in constant currency terms. Net income was a record 146.4 million an increase of 33% over the prior year, and earnings per share was $1.90, an increase of 36% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains strong and is conservatively geared. At June 30, total assets stood at 1.5 billion and net equity was 1.1 billion. Group external debt was 162 million, while our cash and cash equivalents totaled 416 million as of June 30. I'd now like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran Gallahue: Thanks, Brett. All right, operator, why don’t we start the questions? Thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please proceed.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter here, and great year. Thanks for taking my questions, and thank you for officially making me afraid to get on an airplane ever again. Just a couple of quick ones, just the first a breakdown of revenues, I know you gave it on constant currency, but can you give us just the numbers there for flow generators and masks?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure, Brett, you want to answer that.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, I will break it down. For flow generators in the US, it was 69.7 million; the rest of world was 79.6. And for masks other in the US 64.5, and the rest of world 38.2.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Great, okay. And then just one follow-up, just on the market in general, obviously clearly you guys are taking share. I know your competitors haven't had quite the success you have had, and I know Kieran you kind of brought up some things that we have heard you talk about before; obviously it seems like it is getting more awareness. The market growth has been pretty solid and stable. Is there a sort of sense that there is the kind of reenergy here in the market that the market kind of maybe is reaccelerating in any way, shape or form or is this really a lot of market share gains, and we're just kind of steady or still growing [ph]?
Kieran Gallahue: Well, I think you know, the market has remained healthy all during this time period when so many other industries have suffered incredible challenges. That includes many part of the healthcare business. You know, we haven't seen a dramatic change in the business. Early in the January timeframe, we said that maybe there is a couple of points that were carved off the market or so. We are seeing that basically flat. We are seeing a lot more interest and talk about increasing capacity. We are seeing a lot of excitement about the comorbidities. And in areas for instance, with home sleep testing we are seeing the pilots begin to play out just as we expected. And I think that is creating a general excitement about this area, and a recognition that this is the kind of market that even in difficult times still has the ability to be growing in double digits. And I think that that has opened the eyes of many of the players in the marketplace, has given them comfort and given them renewed energy. So I think there are just a lot of good things that keep happening in this marketplace.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Great. Well, congrats, I will get back in queue here.
Kieran Gallahue: Thanks. And by the way, you should also feel uncomfortable on the roads because truckers have it at even at a higher rate than pilots.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Just a question about – along the similar lines. I guess with the economy being tough and hospitals particularly investing less, we see signs that investments in sleep lab beds have slowed down. I was just wondering if you see similar signs, and whether you're seeing that impacting on market growth?
Kieran Gallahue: You know, we didn't see or feel anything different this quarter than we had in the last quarter. And from that perspective, I would say that there is not a lot of change out there. What you are saying is that there is an increased emphasis on, for instance, HME’s part, where they recognized the ability to monitoring the installed base. As things get difficult across-the-board what they look for is where the growth opportunities are. And this is the same thing that happened three years ago when oxygen in neb-med reimbursement got cut, and suddenly everybody recognized that the sleep market has been underserved. So what you're hearing from HME is a renewed emphasis on looking at compliant users, making sure those compliant users are appropriately followed up with, that to the extent that they deserve have accessories and masks, to the extent that their payers will support the patients in those, that these patients should be better served. So there is multiple ways of growing a marketplace. Some as the fundamental diagnostic capacity, some of it is how you use that capacity in other words, the mix between split nights versus a dual night studies. And finally there is the means of mining that compliant user base, and I think that we are seeing customers in all those cases focus on getting more from what they have.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks very much. This is another question, national contracts and movements there, is there something else we are trying to break out, and I know you don't want to comment on particular contracts, but could you give us a sense as to whether there were any changes there that had any influence on this quarter?
Kieran Gallahue: No, I think you are right. I don't think it is useful to break out by customer type. We are doing very well across the board. We have been working very hard not only from a product perspective in bringing innovative technologies to market, but also whenever possible making it easier to do business with ResMed, because we believe that helps support the goals of the HMEs and improves their profitability and perhaps most importantly helps them improve patient care. You may have different techniques from time to time, but the same underlying fundamentals work with both the independents and with the nationals. And so as a result, we are seeing wins in all categories.
David Low – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Thanks guys. Just – maybe a question for Brett on the gross margin outlook for 2010, you said 60% to 62%. So if it hits a headwind, are there offsets that you are thinking about to arrive at that number as well from the cost side?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, Alex. This is Brett. Definitely, basically as we have been saying for a little while now, we're working a lot on the cost side, and on the cost of the business, and there is many – not just a silver bullet, but across – basically right across the board on many initiatives. And the expectation really is that those ones will start to kick in and mitigate any of the currency headwinds that we will have as we move through the fiscal year. So if you think about Singapore manufacturing for example, some work on logistics, on their freights and warehousing, materials purchasing. New products, obviously as we roll through the fiscal year, will have an impact, and then overlying that we have a continuous improvement program, which had excellent engagement down here in Sydney. So it is a combination of all those factors that makes us confident we can – that they will actually expand the margin, even though that currency will obviously be a negative for us.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Okay, terrific. And maybe for Kieran, can you give us any idea of whether that will be new product launches during the next quarter?
Kieran Gallahue: So we're not going to get into that fine into details for obvious competitive and customary reasons, but let me just say then that the next 12 months is going to be an incredibly busy 12 months, and we will be busy even before the end of this calendar year. So this is going to be a very exciting year for us across both masks and flow generators.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Okay, terrific. Thanks for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Great, Kieran, maybe just following up on that last question, can you characterize how significant a change kind of the next-generation platforms from you, and if you can to some extent your competitors will be versus where we are. Are we talking about a modest improvement in technology or there is something more dramatic we can point towards?
Kieran Gallahue: And you are talking flow generators or are you talking masks?
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Primarily generators, but if you want to comment on masks that will be great.
Kieran Gallahue: well I think that there are opportunities across the board. I obviously cannot speak in detail for my competitors. That will be questions that are better targeted towards them. I will say as an industry overall, there is still a lot of innovation to be brought to bear in this marketplace as the technology continues to progress and some of that has to do with the use of informatics, and how these devices, these therapeutic devices fit in not only as a therapeutic device in and out of itself, but also as a node within a system of care. There is – and you can kind of get a feel for that with, for instance, the ResTracks data systems and the continued evolution that you would expect to see with those informatics systems. I think there is continued opportunity to improve on noise levels, on algorithms that are applied to patients in order to improve comfort or either reduce or deskill the labor that is applied. And I think those are important points by the way, because if you look at health care across the globe and what we seeing certainly over the last decade is that health care systems are trying to contain costs and in part by either reducing the amount of labor applied or deskilling the labor that is supplied in the care process. And they are also trying to move people out of expenses settings into the home settings. Both of those play to half strength, and there is innovation that could be brought to bear that simplifies the administration of the therapy and making sure people are compliant, while increasing the efficacy. So there is a significant amount of opportunity for us to continue to innovate in multiple ways. On the mask side of the business, it is still about how do you make it easy for the care providers to set the product upon the patient, how do you improve the comfort, the immediate comfort and the long-term comfort of the patient. How do you improve the efficacy through managing leak, and how do you wrap that whole thing into a system cell. And then finally when you look across both of those platforms there is opportunity for bit of Moore's Law, where we can improve the functionality while addressing the cost of goods. So we're going to be hitting on all those cylinders as we go through this year.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Maybe just one other question on generators, you talked about mix being very positive for you, can you characterize where we are as a percent of mix as we look at the different, maybe three or four different broad areas, and you have even often talked about present auto setting in the past, where maybe is that now?
Kieran Gallahue: So when you look at from a percentage perspective, I guess we can look at it from a number of different ways. We continue to be under penetrated in the bilevel category, and we have an incredible platform that is underpinned by the Easy Breathe motor technology that makes our devices far quieter, in some cases up to 90% quieter, while being more comfortable for the patients. So the first thing is major mix shifts within that. We have a significant opportunity for continued growth because our products are simply market standard and it has been an area that we have been under penetrated in the past. We do see continued growth on the Autoset side of the business, and even the Escape II, where we have put in additional functionality with the EPR. So we're seeing it across the boundaries, and we are comfortable with the growth in each of these categories, not only from what we have achieved to date, but with further penetration in the future. As far as specific percentages on the mix of Autosets, Brett do you have the current figures on that.
Brett Sandercock: Yes, it is probably in the order of 25%, somewhere around that mark. Certainly, Autoset continues to be the strongest growing category.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay. And is Europe still kind of a 60ish, or has it moved higher as well?
Kieran Gallahue: That has been more of an autosetting market. It is probably around that, about 60% to 70% mark.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: And then last question, I will hop off. If you think about the 10 MSA that are going to be bidding in October, have you guys looked at what percentage of the market that might represent and then what the next group of MSAs that bid in the eleven might represent the market, and how we might anticipate lead through?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, I think first of all I think it is 9 MSAs now. They eliminated Puerto Rico. So I think – it is clearly a minority of the marketplace as far as what percent is covered directly by that. I couldn't give you the percent, but it is a small percent of the total market. I think more than anything else when you talk to HMEs, many of them feel that the last round of competitive bidding was just so poorly implemented that the likelihood of this being implemented well is a challenge and many of them feel that, even to the extent that this delayed process, because it is obviously been delayed again, right? Or it was delayed several months ago, and that redelayed, but delayed several months ago. That there is a feeling that if it is not administered properly, and if there is a significant push back from the community that it may make full rollout of competitive bidding very challenging as well. So I think there is a lot of water to go under the bridge before we forecast what the impact of that will be or won't be.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Thank you.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bye with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Co.: Hi. Thanks guys. A couple just on the home sleep testing, I mean you mentioned airlines and truckers, what is the – for some of these occupational groups to develop models for sleep testing instead of sending their members to sleep labs, are you hearing anything there. We notice the Aetna CareCore National deal here in New York sort of a trial there. And I think (inaudible) is playing around with it too. Is there anymore color you can see about programs going on out there?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. I would look at those two things independently, although one can be supportive of the other. There is the opportunity in occupational health, which is certainly not dependent on HSD coming in, but rather the entire marketplace has the dynamics that is associated with HSD, which anything that lowers the cost of diagnosis and simplifies it, will not only help it in the occupational health area, but it will also help in all aspects, whether it is looking at the comorbidities, whether it is looking at you garden variety, sleep disordered breathing patient. So if we segment those two different things there are a number of companies, HMEs or start-ups that have tried to focus on the occupational health category, and there is no doubt that the introduction of HST has us even more excited looking at different models, because particularly those categories of transport workers where there are moving to a different location every night. The idea of a mobile screener if you will, a mobile diagnostic tool certainly makes diagnosis even more simple, and so there is a number of start-ups that we have heard about out there or other HMEs that are looking to get engaged in that process. And that is good. The more noise there is, the more opportunity to address the big players and transport more likely that we will get to a tipping point sooner. With HST overall, just sort of general update on that, we are the one who said that the last calendar year was the year that really was established whether or not home sleep testing was here to stay or not. And clearly from the fact that CMS and the largest payers have jumped on board with it, it is very clear that home sleep testing is here to stay, and it is just a matter of how it rolls out and the speed. This year as we have said is the year of the pilot. And it is really working out the three Ps. It is looking at the pricing. So what are people going to get paid from their different payers. What are the processes? So how do different healthcare providers integrate home sleep testing into the way that they do business, and what are the various flows associated with that. And the last one is politics, which is, what is the interaction among the channels, among the different physicians. And that is always the hardest one to predict the timing of when that is going to play out. We have heard of, we have seen a number of pilots that in fact have started as we have anticipated and they range from HMEs to sleep physicians to primary care physicians to independent diagnostic testing facilities. So you have a number of different players that are testing the three Per share, if you will, of home sleep testing. And they are using a variety of devices. Certainly many are finding the simplicity and cost effectiveness of ApneaLink and ApneaLink Plus is very convenient for them. And there are other solutions out there, which is fine because what this is all about is opening access to the markets. So our intention as we go through this is to continue to support our sleep physician partners and the sleep community and our long-standing relationships, and be able to do the best we can to help them provide quality patient care and open up access to more patients. So it is moving and it is moving right along the pace that we had anticipated.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Co.: Okay, and then a couple of more. Just on Washington, what are you hearing from your DME customers in the sense of compliance mandates for follow-up with the physician, risk of not getting that and not getting paid by Medicare. How much panic is there among some of the guys or the smaller guys on accreditation? Is that going to affect on October 1 if at all, and any thoughts about any interim cuts in 2010, until we get competitive bidding starting in 2011?
Kieran Gallahue: So, the major buzz is in a couple of categories. One is with compliance monitoring, and you know that ruling, which came out almost a year ago now. That is when the starting gun went off, and that is when we started to see a huge up-tick in interest for the ResTracks GSM and in some of the higher-end systems that work particularly well with ResTracks GSM and also help support patient compliance. So, I think the community has reacted or we saw the first wave of reaction to that and what they realize is that with all those data that they now need to manage and with the importance of gaining compliance, I think there is a renewed emphasis on compliance, and that this good for the patients. That is good for the industry. That is certainly good for ResMed because of the nature of our products. And because this is a chronic disorder where people are treated for decades, every patient that can be captured that can be – that we can keep compliant in those early days represents a long-term annuity stream and good health care. So this renewed emphasis, I think the HMEs have sort of taken it on board. They are taking the actions. It is leading to very good conversations at the field level – to act as consultants in the selling process, and we have the technologies that can help make them more successful. The other buzz from the Washington side there is just a lot of interest on HMEs really around oxygen. That is where the primary emphasis is. There is a desire to keep oxygen out of the competitive bidding to remove the 36 month cap. So, there is a lot of action. Their focus tends to be more on the O2 side, and I think there is a greater level of comfort and security on the sleep side, because they know that it is a highly under penetrated market and in any case represents significant growth opportunities.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Co.: Okay, and just one last follow-up, the VS-3 [ph] ventilator had sort of the first full quarter I think on the full supply that you have, and you know, any leverage on the H1N1 stuff going on, especially overseas?
Kieran Gallahue: So, VS-3 is a great product and it is doing quite well. As far as bump up from the flu, no, we're not seeing at this point. We are hearing a lot of discussion around it, obviously as you know with the – it is mainly the southern hemisphere at the current time and there is the expectation that it could quite a spread in the Northern hemisphere. At this point, we are not seeing any thing like bumps we got out of bird flu and that sort of thing. Not yet.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Co.: Okay, thanks, guys.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Thanks for taking my call guys. I was just going to ask just in terms of Singapore, what sort of percentage of volume do you think that is going to start contributing in the 2010 year?
Brett Sandercock: Andrew it is Brett. If you look say FY09, it is probably in the order of 10% to 15% up there. I think as we move through fiscal 2010, it is probably more like the order of 20% to 25% of the total. So it certainly will progressively ramp up through the fiscal year, and there is a meaningful amount there now. And that will build, and obviously that will help us on the manufacturing or cost front. The other thing it does is it also diversifies a little bit out of the Aussie dollar. To the extent the [inaudible] there has been seeing dollars. We need a little more position now, the Aussie a bit stronger in terms of our cost base. So for example the Singapore dollar over the last three months was up about 3%. If you compare that to the Aussie, which was close to 50, you can see there is quite a bit of difference there. So that decision to diversify risk mitigation et cetera is also going to support us on the cost base as well.
Kieran Gallahue: I say we have been very pleased with the ramp up of the Singapore facility, and also want to note that we remain very committed to our facilities down in Australia. We have got fantastic employees down there. We are in a very fortunate position with the growth in this market and the growth in volume, and that we can remain committed to a given geographic region, and at the same time have the ability to expand elsewhere.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Can I just – just looking at rest of world masks, there were sort of 4%, can I just ask you characterize how we should be thinking about those?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, I mean, you know, the ROW masks tend to grow at a slower rate than you will see in the US. And it tends to be a little bit lumpier. In this case we had some pretty challenging base year comps. So I just think it is sort of a timing issue.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Okay. There is nothing particular regulatory changes in your paying countries or anything?
Kieran Gallahue: There are zero fundamental changes.
Brett Sandercock: Just to put the tough comp in perspective, I think we grew 30% the year before in that category. Kieran said that it tends to be a little bit lumpy.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much. I will get back in the queue.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
Kieran Gallahue: Thanks.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: Kieran, I will start with going back just to your commentary about the US market, sorry if I missed it, I am bumping between calls. Just wondering what you saw in the first half of this calendar year, the last half of your fiscal year, as it relates to US market growth, and it is hard to tell what Respironics is doing, specifically I suppose, but obviously you guys gained share, and I'm just wondering sort of what you are looking for going forward in terms of market growth here in the United States?
Kieran Gallahue: By all indications, the US market continued to grow in double digits. We saw probably in the January timeframe as we discussed earlier, there might have been a bit of a tick down, maybe a couple of points, but we haven't seen that regress any further than that. This last quarter felt very similar to the quarter before that. So that was a very comforting feeling that we are in good shape in the marketplace. I think you are right. I think we're gaining share. I will say we still have very worthy competitors. I think Phillips is a very strong competitor and one we respect and think that they are good for the industry. We have been doing well both at large customers and smaller customers, and I think we are benefiting from a couple of things, I think both very significant differentiation in our technologies both on the mask and the flow generators side and that is something I think we will see continuing through the new product launches that we have in the next 12 months. And I think just fundamental execution at the field level.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: Thanks, got it. So as you look forward over the next two or three quarters, you're looking for market growth in the US in that double-digit range. You guys also are going to be comparing against some really nice quarters in the second half of last calendar year. At the same time you're planning to launch some new products which I'm sure you hope will sustain your growth. So, could you maybe discuss the juxtaposition of the difficult comps with the new products launching relative to where you are sort of expecting the market to grow, and I guess the bottom line is do you continue to expect to gain share or hold your share during the time you're competing in some earlier quarters last year?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, I mean you know that we never talk in you know, single quarters because one of the things that we are very adamant about it not managing a business quarter-to-quarter, and I think that gets very dysfunctional over time. So, you know, let's talk about the way that we always talk about things, which is we look over the next 12 months, we look over the next 18 months, et cetera. Do I think that we have the ability to continue to gain market share? You bet. Do I think that we are in a market that's going to continue to grow in the double digits? You bet. I think that we're in very good positions. No doubt, you're right. We've got certainly tougher comps coming up than we had in the past and I think that you know, that's recognized and that's a good thing. You know, keeps the sales force focused, and we continue to enjoy the benefits of those wins that we have had in the past.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Couple of just follow up questions. I'm wondering what your thoughts are and update as it relates to comorbidities and typically what you're doing or thinking about in terms of partnerships to explore further comorbidities with sleep disordered breathing?
Kieran Gallahue: Well, you know, the blessing and curse of being involved in – and being a leader in the sleep disordered breathing marketplace is that it seems we overlap with every with every costly comorbidity on the planet. You know, whether you're talking about heart failure, whether you're talking about diabetes, whether you're talking about drug-resistant hypertension, whether you're talking about obesity and our ventilation business, we are square in the middle of COPD. You know, so the opportunity is enormous. But life is about execution and execution is about focus, and so we are – we try to be relatively disciplined about how we approach each of these comorbidities and they are at various stages of development. You know, some of them where the knowledge, let's say in hypertension as example, it's well known and understood ever since the JNC seven guidelines that sleep disordered breathing is a major cause of hypertension and treating the sleep disordered breathing can bring down blood pressure. Now, we still have education to do, and I think you'll see a much greater focus on primary care physicians in the coming year as we help them understand sleep disordered breathing and we work as an industry to help them understand sleep disordered breathing, and the role that CPAP can play in treating that. You have other comorbidities where we are at a little bit earlier stage. The data is fantastic, but we probably have even more opportunities for education. So, you know, we try to balance the investment. We try not to try to, you know, bore the ocean all at once, but we try to focus, use partnerships where it is appropriate, use internal business development resources when it's appropriate and then we get to critical mass stage, we spread it out to the sales force to try to strengthen relationships with their contacts. So, you know, it's a matter of having the opportunities but focusing specifically where we think the best pay back is.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: It's helpful as well. Last question from me, Kieran. Trends in the market as it relates to you mentioned your customers are focusing on mining their customers, and I'm wondering if you've seen any change in trend as it relates to patients using masks. I think the last time we asked it was still hovering around one mask per patient per year, notwithstanding the reimbursement for more than that. Wondering what you guys are doing to drive that higher and whether or not we've seen some benefits from anything you're doing to do that.
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, so I can answer that mostly from an anecdotal basis and then I can from a specific number which is, you know, it is always very difficult to get out anyway just because of the ability to segment replacement from new user masks, but the – but in our dialogue with our customers and their request for things like drop ship directly to patients and their request to support their resupply to learn about how to set up resupply initiatives. What we feel very comfortable in saying is that the HMEs continue to increase their focus on that very valuable segment of compliant users, and you're also seeing new players get in to the mix, who may have let's say previously focused on other disease states that see the opportunity in sleep, and may have particular skill sets and direct consumer marketing as an example that are trying to stimulate greater use. You know, I think we talked down in the last conference call, in the last six months you started to see direct consumer advertising on TV for compliant users. I mean, that is just an indication of what's going on in this industry, and when you have one player that's doing that I can assure you that the other leaders in the industry look at that and try to understand how they either defend against that or leverage that – those kinds of activities to stimulate their own growth. So it's a good sort of dominoes affecting dominoes process, where the HMEs recognize the attractiveness of serving the compliant users.
Jason Mills – Canaccord Adams: Great. Great quarter, guys.
Kieran Gallahue: All right, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Hi, may I also say great quarter. Couple of little things, capital expenditures in 2010 now that you've completed the new facility in San Diego, what might that be?
Brett Sandercock: Joanne, it is Brett. With the Aussie dollar appreciation in Euro, it will probably be around when I look forward about 12 million to 15 million a quarter on CAPEX and it will be predominantly operational CapEx because we have as you know, finished out a booming cycle.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, is there any way to quantify of the 62% gross margins a quarter, how many basis points came from foreign exchange? You can start trying to peel away the onion a little bit to understand it.
Brett Sandercock: I mean, if you look at that there's a lot of factors that impact the margin, geographic mix, product mix, FX, manufacturing efficiencies, et cetera. If I look at sequentially, manufacturing efficiencies or improvements in logistics and so on, and FX had a similar impact and those were the key drivers.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so just sort of take the improvement sequentially and divide it in half?
Brett Sandercock: Well, they are the key drivers. We have slightly better product mix, slightly worse geographic mix and, you know, ISP were always there, but the two big drivers were FX and then the manufacturing efficiencies or improvements.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, helpful. Thank you. Res products have recently had a recall. Is there anything you can comment on that and what it may mean for your position in the market? Did you see anything from that in the quarter?
Kieran Gallahue: You know, we've heard buzz, but you know, one of the things where we ask our sales force to be disciplined and focused on positive selling, and focus on the benefits that our products can bring to market. So, you know, it's not something that we talk about a lot and it's not something that we promote within our commercial organization.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, will we be seeing some of your new products at Medtrade this fall?
Kieran Gallahue: Maybe. It was a great try Joanne. Great try.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thank you very much.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Michael Matson – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi, just sort of related to Joanne's question. I think last quarter you all said that you saw a net $0.05 positive impact on your EPS from currency. I was wondering if you could quantify what the overall impact from currency was this quarter.
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, Michael. It was pretty strong this quarter. I estimate in the order of $0.10.
Michael Matson – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then with regards to the increased compliance documentation requirements from Medicare, are you seeing that from other private payers as well, and then sort of a follow-up to that what happens with the CPAP units, when patients are not compliant or they don't go back to check in with their doctor after they've been using it and the HME isn't able to collect all the reimbursement. Are they able to pull those products back and put them back into service?
Kieran Gallahue: So, with regards to the first question, we are seeing some interest but I'm not hearing about it any broad scale adoption of changes in the compliance monitoring world. With regards to what are they doing with the units, they've always had a certain amount of units that have come back and they usually – different players use them differently. Some of them put them in loaner [ph] pool so that they can have – use them with the initial patients, and then once they are compliant they'll put out new units on them. So some of them sort of have these loaner pools they use during the introductory phase, some of them donate to charity. I mean, there is a lot of different uses. I think the key emphasis on this though, what the HMEs are really driving towards is improving compliance, and so I think that this regulation, although certainly none of the HMEs would necessarily ask for it. I think what their finding is that there is a significant unintended benefit or maybe it is intended benefit. Let's give it the benefit of doubt that there is more emphasis on compliance, and that it appears that there may be an improvement in compliance, which means you'll have less units coming back anyway, and you'll have better long-term prospects with these compliant users.
Michael Matson – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, and then you know, your cash is now more than 10% of your market cap, and I guess just doing some rough math of 10 million shares that you have been authorized to repurchase would eat up pretty much all the cash you have right now. Can I infer from that that you're not going to really be looking at acquisitions, or are you active kind of in the business development area, and are there things out there that you could actually buy that would fit with your business model?
Kieran Gallahue: So, I wouldn't directly associate either our gross or our net cash position with – entirely be in the buyback. I mean that's certainly one use of cash and obviously we've – if you look over the last 18 months we've used that $140 million in cash buying back shares. So it's certainly one of the uses of cash. You know, are we looking at potential acquisition targets or investment in various forms. Absolutely, we always do that and, you know, one of the things that we changed organizationally a year ago is we went to a strategic business unit structure that allows us to look at the way that we develop and acquire technologies in a different way, and that certainly opens up the avenue for us to be a bit more proactive in our sort of appearance or the way that we look at different opportunities. I would say this though. We remain disciplined and one of the strengths I think of ResMed over time has been the fact that cash does not burn a hole in our pocket that we do not go out and try to chase the next deal. We are in a very, very attractive under penetrated market. We are market leader within that segment and so our thresholds for looking at acquisitions is quite high. You know, we want to make sure that it either helps us in our core business or represents a significant upside growth opportunity, and we are rather disciplined when we look at those things. So it's not going to burn a hole in our pocket. The feel that we are in a very strong financial condition. It holds us in great stead during the times when other companies may feel challenged and we feel good about that.
Michael Matson – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then, just one quick question on the guidance ranges that were given on your operating expenses, did those include your stock-based compensation expense, the SG&A in particular the 31% to 33% I think as well as the guidance?
Brett Sandercock: Yes, they do.
Michael Matson – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, thanks.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Simpson with RBS. Please proceed.
David Simpson – RBS: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. Look, I just want your impressions of the potential for US healthcare reform and then the impact of that on ResMed going forward?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure, I mean I think it's anybody's guess at this point what kind of healthcare reform takes place. I mean it'll be hard to believe that there will be no legislation in the area and the question is just how far-reaching it is, and what the both the intended and unintended consequences of that are. I will say that I think we feel ourselves well positioned, whether or not healthcare reform comes through, and the reason is when you look at the fundamentals of what we do, we are sitting in the middle of a metabolic syndrome and sleep disordered breathing touches on the most costly chronic disorders in the planet. And so whether you're talking about diabetes, whether you're talking about heart failure, whether you're talking about COPD with our ventilation business, we have the ability of providing very cost-effective care, and, you know, what are they trying to do is we discussed earlier today, you know, healthcare systems across the globe have been trying to either eliminate or deskill labor in order to take cost down and they're trying to take people out of costly care settings such as the hospitals and put them in lower-cost settings, and guess where that is. That's the home, that's the most cost-effective way of providing care. So, we are I think very, very strategically positioned, regardless of which side things come down on, and you know, I mentioned before the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, and nobody would disagree I believe that the NHS is probably one of the most frugal healthcare systems in the planet, and they were certainly ahead of the curve in the establishment of National Institute of Clinical Excellence to look at a health economic situation and to make sure that there is an economic balance in the care process, and I think it's very important to note. I mean they came out with a study after looking at the data and said it is cost advantageous to identify and treat more people with sleep disordered breathing. So the extent that you know, prepared effectiveness comes out let's say to the extent that that is based on the NICE standards, which you would imagine at least in part it would be. To me that bodes well. So you know, we are not so concerned about the whole changes that are forecasted here. You know, could it put more people into the system? You bet. Is that a benefit to us? Yes. Could it be more focused on cost controls? You bet. Do we position ourselves very well as a category that helps control costs in the healthcare systems? You bet. I think we are at a very unique and a very well positioned part of the industry.
David Simpson – RBS: Thanks for that and just as a follow-up, just like a bit of color I guess in terms of the rest of the world, you know, the relative performance of Asia versus EU in the quarter?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes. So, for us, Asia-Pac represents 1% to 10% of our business and it tends to be a very lumpy business. So quarter-to-quarter trends are really hard to pick out. If you look at over the last year, you know, not talking about any given quarter it was very, very good, strong growth and you know, we tend to still be dominated first by Japan and second by Australia and New Zealand, and the other markets though they certainly represent significant long-term upside, opportunity remains on the smaller side.
David Simpson – RBS: Okay, thanks guys very much.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for closing remarks. You may proceed.
Kieran Gallahue: Thank you. And thank you all for joining us as always and as always I also want to thank all of our employees across the globe in their various functions because ResMed is a collection of its individuals acting as a team, and we have fantastic team members in all the functions and across the globe and these results, these stellar results are really a result of their efforts and their dedication to patient care. I can say that we are excited about our future. We've got high margin, exciting new products rolling out over the course of the next year. The market for our sleep disordered breathing is still highly under penetrated. New policies approving the use of home testing are going to reduce the barriers for accessing patient care. We've got a stellar balance sheet, significant operating cash flow, and as I mentioned an absolutely first-rate team to assure and focus on execution. So thank you very much, and I look forward – and we look forward to updating you as the fiscal year 2010 progresses. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-05-07 16:30:00) =====

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tania, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projection of forward... of future revenue of earnings, new product developments or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which maybe accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Thanks Tania. Well, good afternoon, welcome to ResMed's third quarter earnings call. As with our previous calls, I'm going to begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer. He will go through the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions. So for those of you, who have seen the press release, you know the we had another very solid quarter. Once again, we demonstrated the power of being a well balanced geographically diversified company with well accepted high quality diverse mix of profits. We are pleased to report the global revenue in the third quarter 2009 grew 8%, or up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in the Americas accelerated to 23% year-over-year, which is the same growth we experience in Q2 of 2009. ROW revenue declined by 6% in constant currency terms... excuse me, but in constant currency terms, it grew 10%, which is also a sequential improvement. As expected, currency had a significant effect on ROW revenue. GAAP EPS increased 34% to $0.51, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was one penny better at $0.52. We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generator sales, up 7% or at 16% in constant currency. And mask segments growing at 9% during the quarter, which also translates to a 16% increase in constant currency. We saw significant growth in all product segments of flow generators. Globally, the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, especially the S8 AutoSet II and VPAP Auto. We also had solid growth in our mid-range S8 Escape II now with EPR patient comfort functionality. Both revenue and unit volumes increased across the flow generator product line in Americas and Europe. Sales of Americas' flow generators were up 24% year-over-year in Q3 and similar growth to Q2 of '09 and sales in ROW improved to 11% in constant currency terms. As a result of changing product mix in the sleep device category towards higher end technology, our gross margins are also improving. The fastest growing segment in the U.S. flow generator business in percentage terms continues to be the auto adjusting, positive airwave pressure and bilevel segments. This plays well into our clinical leadership with the S8 AutoSet II, VPAP Auto, as well as our new VPAP S along with other products in these segments. Europe showed particularly strong growth in the VPAP IV series sales. In France and Germany, we continue to gain market share in this important high margin, flow generator market segment. Ventilation business unit sales as a whole, also rebounded in Europe. Our Easy-Breathe technology is now available across the entire sleep device platforms from CPAP to APAP and through to our VPAP SV devises. The whisper-quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class. Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and it's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise. With CMS mandating patient compliance for ongoing payment, sales of our wireless compliance technology, ResTracks GSM (ph) are growing significantly with more and more momentum. We remain the only company that provides wireless transcripts sleep apnea data to an Internet system. Customers are finding that the wireless approach can be convenient and highly affective to not only capture compliance data, but also to monitor efficacy of treatment. We believe that physicians indeed CMEs, who want to further drive compliance beyond Medicare patients. This will occur a sleep disorder breathing treatment compliance monitoring as shown to lower medical costs and improve efficiencies. At that point, other payers are very likely to follow suite. Once again we posted double digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continued to increase market share. Mask sales grew 22% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 8% in ROW. Mask sales in the Americas were strong across all product lines, with the Mirage Activa LT, the Swift LT and Swift LT for Her doing particularly well. There are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace. As a remainder, these re-designed LT masks are smaller, lighter and more streamline versions of the predecessors. The Swift LT for Her product is gaining traction as a comfortable and quiet solution for our female patients as this is the first and only general specific product mask product in the market. It's also an ideal solution for side sleepers. And the Activa LT is less oppressive mask because patient's superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. With these new masks in the global marketplace, we remain focused on growing market share with high margin industry leading profits. Looking forward over the next 12 to 15 months, we plan to launch a series of new products and flow generators. In addition within the next several months, we plan to introduce the ApneaLink Plus, our type three home diagnostic devices that will meet even more of the existing reimbursement and position requirements. As we said last quarter, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms this calendar year. We are working closely with our sleep position partners to make home testing reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. We also expect growth result from continued and improved awareness in validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays and a very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races is becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disorder breathing and treatments for sleep disorder breathing can not only improve health, but may dramatically lower healthcare costs within these populations. Ten months ago we projected that we would be able to grow gross margins and we are pleased to report that gross margin improved 60 to 61% in Q3. Benefiting from currency impact, favorable geographic product mix driven by high and flow end generators and masks as well as our margin improvement plan gaining traction. We're confident that we can continue to maintain gross margins around this level in fiscal 2009 as we further penetrate markets with our new products and continue to leverage cost efficiencies across our global organization with improvements in supply chain and manufacturing while also ramping production in Singapore. Again we had as strong performance in operating flow. We came in at $44.2 million demonstrating our commitment to strong performance and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q3 over $327 million. Now over to Brett to provide some additional details on the P&L and then we'll take your questions. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Kieran. Let's briefly run through our March quarter results. And as Kieran added, revenue for the March quarter was 227.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. As expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our third quarter revenues by approximately 17.6 million. So in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Our income from operations for the quarter was 52.5 million, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was 39.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52. Our gross margin for the quarter was 61%, which is up sequentially from Q2, FY '09, reflecting foreign currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements. The product mix impact was largely attributable to the continuation of strong sales in a new available range in all our safety devices, particularly in our domestic market. Our third quarter margin now reflects the full benefits associated with the deprecation in the Australian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar. Looking forward, we expect this currency impact together with our ongoing margin improvement initiatives in supply chain, manufacturing and product development, should say our gross margin keep continue in the range of 60 to 62% for the balance of fiscal year '09. SG&A expenses for the quarter was 70.9 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue improved to 31% compared to the year ago figure of 33%. The modest growth in headline SG&A expenses reflects the impact of the depreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar. R&D expenses for the quarter was 13.9 million, a decrease of 7% of the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 22% over the prior year quarter. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 6%, compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. And looking forward, subject of course the currency movements, we expect R&D expenses at percentages of revenue to be in the 6% range for the balance of fiscal year '09. The lower R&D spend as percentage of revenue reflected depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar as a majority of our R&D spending dominated in Australian dollars. We do continue to invest in product innovation and clinical study activities. Amortization of the core intangibles is 1.7 million for the quarter and stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 6.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9% and looking forward, we expect our fiscal year 2010 tax rate to bring the vicinity of 26%. Turning now to our revenue since recapping some of those numbers, the overall Americas sales were 122.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generated and masks with strong contributions from our autosetting sleeping devices, a new range of bilevel devices and our Swift LT masks. As a reminder, I know that Q3, the last quarter, prior to the anniversary of the introduction into the U.S. market, was very successful with S8 II flow generator range and Swift LT masks. So, outside the Americas totaled 105.4 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter. As expected, sales outside of the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particularly depreciation of the euro against U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside Americas increased by 10% over the prior year quarter, with balanced growth across our flow generator and mask categories. Breaking out revenues between product segments in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 24% over the prior year quarter while masks increased by 22%. For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 11% over the prior year quarter while masks and other increased by 8%. On a group basis and constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 16% while masks also increased by 16%. Our cash flow from operations was a solid 44.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and modest growth in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 22 million, including 10.6 million in building construction costs, associated with the construction of our new headquarters in San Diego. I am pleased to note that building is now completed, and we have scheduled to relocate to the new premises on May 11, 2009. We'll make final payments associated with the building, approximately 21 million that's spread over the next few quarters. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled 12.5 million. We continue to buyback shares, as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 769,000 shares, a consideration of 26.6 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. For the fiscal year to-date, we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of 52.7 million. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares out of the total approved buyback of 8 million shares. ResMed ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 in excellent financial shape. Our balance sheet remains very strong and is conservatively geared. At March 31, total assets stood at 1.3 billion and net equity was 1 billion. Group external debt was 160 million while our cash and cash equivalents totaled 327 million. I'd now like to make some comments in relation to currency movements and their expected impact on our fourth quarter results assuming current exchange rates. Firstly, we will continue to experience year-on-year currency headwinds in relation to group revenue. I highlight that this would be a significant impact on our Q4 revenue as reported in U.S. dollars. Specifically for the last quarter of fiscal year '09, we estimate currency headwinds of between 20 and 25 million. Conversely, our operating expenses will continue to benefit from the depreciation of international currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This benefit is reflected in our Q3 results and therefore it provides an indicative base for our operating expense run rate over the next few quarters. Subject of course that currency movements over these period, and you'll note the currency movements have been very volatile; I'll walk you though soon (ph). Finally, our gross margin now reflects the full benefit with the Australian dollar appreciation; and therefore on a sequential basis, we're not expecting further margin expansion through the impact of favorable currency movements. In summary, we expect currency movements to continue to have a positive impact on our net income in the fourth quarter of '09. And we expect net income to grow faster than our constant currency revenue growth. Now, I'd like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Great. Thanks, Brett. And thank you for reviewing those numbers again, certainly another strong quarter. Tanya, why don't we open it up for questions now?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Yeah. Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter.
Kieran Gallahue: Thank you.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: I guess first question for, Brett. I was hoping you could maybe split out currency and mix from the gross margin improvement, and give us the currency impact on EPS for the quarter?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, I mean if you look to the sequential increases, you see majority would be currency driven, but there's certainly a decent amount of that of the margin improvement is product mix or favorable product mix. Some kind of small improvements with... through manufacturing improvements, but I think most of those improvements will start to manifest themselves in FY '10. But certainly, we had a measurable contribution form both product mix and foreign currency movements or more specifically the falling Australian dollar. If you look... if you want everything clear, it's pretty complex, but you're probably talking in the order of... for instance on the bottom line on currency impact, if you wash it all through.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And then I guess for Kieran, you talked about over the next 12 to 15 months we should see some more product on the full generator masks side. Can you give us a little bit more color? Are these just product extensions, brand new products? How should we be thinking about that?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah. I mean I know it's a bit of a teaser and there's always the desire to get a lot more detail in there. Obviously for competitive reasons, we need to be a bit quiet on that. I can tell you that it's a very exiting product line as... is across flow generators and masks; some of them will be line extensions and some of them will be very different fundamental platforms.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then sorry, one last one for Brett: I didn't catch the U.S. and OUS flow generating or mask growth rates?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah. For the U.S. flow generators, the increase was 24%.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay.
Brett Sandercock: And mask and other was 22%.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, thank you.
Kieran Gallahue: All right, thanks, David.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please go ahead.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Hey guys congrats on a great quarter here. Thanks for taking my question.
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, thanks Jessie (ph).
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Just... can you just make couple of comments about the market in general? I know there were concerns about sort of the U.S. obviously the economy and clearly your numbers don't show that. But maybe just talk about what's going on dynamics in the market right now?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. The fundamentals here are that we remain in a market that is 80% to 90% untapped, right? So, depending on where you are in the world, we are still in an education phase. We are still in the phase of engaging and endocrinologists, cardiologists, primary care physicians. So, fundamentally underlying this business, nothing has really changed from that perspective, we continue to drive awareness and continue to try to grow the pie overall. The big question has come to us certainly over the last nine month is what's going on the economy; is anything happening on the marketplace. And is there some evidence of some sleep labs having bit of a slow down, yeah, I mean, I think we've seen that probably over the last six months that some sleep labs are doing extremely well, some are being hit a bit, and they are slowing down of patient volumes. But it doesn't appear to be dramatically impacting the market anyway. Our view is that it still appears that the market is certainly growing in double-digits and historically, we've said it's been about that 15% plus or minus a few. It's probably still around that, maybe 14% plus or minus a 2. But it's still quite strong and the fundamentals remain very much intact.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. And then just internationally, I know a lot of other people are having trouble in France and Germany. You guys mentioned that those kind of seem to be all right, you grew constant currency 10%. So, again things are okay. But can you just comment through the environment there, is there anything changing over that affects you guys?
Kieran Gallahue: No. I mean look, markets are always dynamic and you are always trying to stay ahead of them. And each of those countries has their own special dynamics that's going on in a given quarter. The fundamentals really haven't changed in any of those areas, we had said, we thought we'd see some improvement this quarter, in fact we did see the improvement, we expect it this quarter. Underlying that no dramatic shifts in the way that governments are looking at sleep. And again, I'll say it's very much similar to the U.S. in the sense that it's about education, it's about getting into the co-morbidities about engaging more healthcare practitioners. So, I think fundamentally, there is just... there's more similarity than differences.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. And then just quick one for Brett, and I'll get back in queue here, basically. Can you just breakout the actual revenue numbers for U.S. flow generator masks, OUS, I know you gave growth rates, can you just break that out?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, Kevin, normally we've just given the growth rates, but we've got in Americas the flow generators around, actually pretty balanced around the 61.4 million mask, and accessory 61.1.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Congrats guys.
Kieran Gallahue: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Germany. Obviously, the performance overall looks like it improved a bit here in international markets. Can you just... can you narrow in on Germany and maybe tell us what growth rates are doing there and how your outlook looks over the next several quarters?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. As you know, we don't get into growth rates individually by countries, but I can say that from sort of a flavor, both France and Germany have been doing quite well. The fundamentals in those market places really remain strong. As you know, we are both a homecare dealer and also we have a wholesale distribution business there. So, they have their own dynamics around when you see improvements in leading indicators versus when you see the improvements in revenue. And quite frankly, we have seen improvements in both. So, I think the team in Germany is executing quite well. There has been some changes in some of the ways that inventory is handled in Germany over the last several months. It's not a massive change the way we do business. It's just sort of the ongoing changes that you see in Germany. And it seems every year there is some tweak to the system. No, I mean the business looks good there. Team is really doing a great job in both Germany and France, and we remain optimistic.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.: And with that change in inventory, would you expect any impact this quarter or should we anticipate just directionally not percentage wise, directionally that that business continues to improve?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, I think that we are going to continue to see in that business as we'll continue to see improvement in execution. I don't think there is going to be any fundamental change because of what's going on the inventory perspective. It's really not that big of deal over the marketplace.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.: Okay. And then thinking bigger picture as you work on the referral channel, we always struggle to figure out what percentage of patience were coming in through the cardiologist and things like that. But what other steps can the company take, relatively cost effectively to try to push that and obviously you can't put a sales force in place. But the things you're going to do above and beyond liberty and some of the other historical initiatives to try to accelerate that and are you going down that path?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, look we spend a lot our time and energy in trying to determine how we can and executing our plan to grow the marketplace. And a large part of that has to do with creating the push and the pull within the cycle. When you look fundamentally what's going on in the marketplace, you've got a few things that are coming together. One is you have excellent clinical data that continues to be available and continues to be published in the voice of the more co-morbidities, right? So, these are articles, these are papers that are in journals that are meaningful to a chronologist or cardiologist. I know that there is paper out today in this month in chest that's talking about cardiac surgery, and if you use CPAP following cardiac surgery that you can expect improved outcomes. I mean that's just news that we crossed the wire today. So, those are very important leading elements in educating that population. Now internally, we have groups that are specifically focused on how we can get the word out to those various healthcare providers, and how we can do it in a way that helps them cost effectively treat their patients. A good example of that is a group that we have in home sleep testing. We are working very closely with our sleep positioned partners and trying to help them understand how they can leverage home sleep test in United States. At the same time, we are begin approached by just as our competitors are being approached by many other types of players in the health care channel, be they primary care physicians, be they independent diagnostic testing facilities et cetera that are piloting at this point home sleep testing, right? And their part of the way, they're providing enablers for these healthcare providers to get engaged in the process of identifying and diagnosing these patients. We have efforts in continuing education, medical education units, where we are either working with partners to help provide them content, so that they can pay for these as well as funding someone on our own. Many those things are not oriented towards ResMed alone there, you're growing the pie, but when you have as much of the market as we do, it's very cost effective and the right thing to do. We continue to drive our public relations efforts, in order to keep sleep disorder breathing and the news. So, it is a... there is no silver bullets here. It's about executing everyday, it's about having a strategy that you focus on, not just in the short-term but the long-term and you hammer at it, you hammer at it, you hammer at it, and we continue to do that.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.: Okay. Thanks Kieran.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: All right, thanks very much guys, great results. Actually, just I guess, following on from the question about the U.S. market. Could you perhaps just characterize what you are seeing happening with market share, perhaps what's the success you are having with some of the large distributors, and maybe if I could just throw in anything you are seeing on home diagnosis as well?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. So, the U.S. market continues as I mentioned before to have a number of very positive things that are affecting it. Obviously, we do have some levels impacting the economy, but because we are so under penetrated, it's just very clear that we continue to have some very positive momentum in that marketplace. I am sure whoever in this business are not trying to sell big iron to hospital, I can tell you that. From a market share perspective, we released the Easy-Breathe technology just about a year ago, right? It was basically this quarter last year, and it's been a very successful product introduction, technology introduction that has allowed us to gain share over the past year. We also... the team has been executing very well. We've had a series of new masks. I mean, it was basically a year ago, this month that we released the Swift LT as an example. So we've had some stiller products that have come on the market that have helped us along with execution in gaining market share. With that being said, we have very worthy competitors. And the competitors I think have also done a good job. I think we've been very fortunate to be able to chip away of that market share, and we certainly appreciate the business that we've been awarded, because of those good products and our hard work at the customer level.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: I was just going to ask... maybe just with... for instance is that still growing perhaps above what your underlying market growth would be?
Kieran Gallahue: So, I'd say certainly the U.S. number, we grew about 23% this quarter. That's certainly would be above market growth this quarter. I don't...
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Right.
Kieran Gallahue: We certainly gain share.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Yeah. And is there a large part of that coming through from... just I guess maybe otherwise decided the contracts still maturing for you?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, look, as we say every quarter, we don't talk specifically about any given customer, but certainly large customers such as the Abrio (ph) we continue to have very strong relationships with. And we're doing quite well with them, and I think they appreciate what we provide and we certainly appreciate their loyalty. So we continue to make strides and good strides with those large customers.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: And just home diagnosis, just any update or any sort stepping stones you're seeing there?
Kieran Gallahue: On the home sleep testing?
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Yeah.
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, home sleep testing... one of the things that we were... we we've been saying is that last year was sort of a year of clarity, right? We'd said that home sleep testing is here to stay and there is lots of back and forth on the NCDs and then clarification of the LCDs and going out to other insurance providers. And this year is the year of piloting; and it's quite frankly, it's been rolling out exactly as we'd expected it to. There are pilots that some of our sleep position partners have engaged in. We're seeing independent diagnostic testing facilities in particular, which the guys that have made a living on for instance doing O2 saturation testing and doing logistics for that. They get paid about 15 to $24. They've built a business on it. Now there's an opportunity, where maybe you can make 150 to $250 on a sleep test. So you might imagine they're extremely excited about it, and they're testing out their models of implementation. We've seen HMEs that have begun to get engaged in this. We've seen other types of docs. So this year's playing out as we expected it, which is this is the year of piloting home sleep testing. And we'd expect that to continue throughout this calendar year.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: And then 2010 start to see more roll out?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, I think you'll see a ramp over time. The inflection point, nobody's got a crystal ball. So you don't know exactly when the inflection point's going to hit. But every quarter that we continue to see these... this expansion of piloting says that this is moving beyond early adopters, and it's getting statement that's required for the general marks and that's good, and that's very good.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Thanks very much. Great results. I'll get back in queue.
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, great. Thanks, Andrew.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good afternoon. This Jim Orith (ph) for Jason.
Kieran Gallahue: Hi, Jim.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. It's Jim. I know... coming up against the tough comp in the U.S. from the S8 launch last year, I know you don't want to give specific product launch guidance, but over the next 15 months of deposit you see are there going to be any significant new U.S. products?
Kieran Gallahue: So, yeah, you're right. We are annualizing some of those product launches and yes, we will be seeing over the next 12 to 15 months products that are global. So U.S. and across the globe that will be as I said across both the masks and the flow generator lines, there will be... some will be line extensions and some will be total platform changes. So it's the whole game. And I do appreciate you realize that those are teasers and you'd always like more information. But really for competitive reasons, we just... we feel uncomfortable going beyond that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. My next question is thinking about the mix shift that's going on in the U.S. and thinking about more high end devices being sold, what do you think is driving that in the United States?
Kieran Gallahue: I think there's a couple of things that are involved here. One is there... some of the larger customers in particular I think have recognized the strength of using appropriate technology in the treatment of these patients and the fact that when you use autosetting technology that it is in many cases will help support compliance to the patients, and they don't get paid unless they have compliant patients and it helps to maintain compliance overtime, because it adapts as the patient adapts. The customers are more and more recognizing that the value of the patient is not just in that initial setup, but rather it is getting the patient compliance and having an annuity stream over, literally in some cases could be decades, because these people that are being diagnosed are frequently in their 30s and 40s, And we don't cure sleep disorder breathing, we treat it and they recognize the revenue streams from that. So adaptive therapy changes with the patient and they see that. But really this whole... it's fascinating this whole move by CMS to key on compliance, to say that there is a stick that comes along with not maintaining compliance on this patient as well as the obvious karat of having an annuity stream, and that's getting a lot of players to look more closely at what it requires to get those patient compliant. A large part of it is masks, it's one of the reasons why our masks, which are market leading, very simple used and very, very comfortable continued to be very well. But it also says, that on the flow generators if they can reduce labor, simplify the process of getting people compliant and then actually adapt with them, so that overtime you can maintain compliance; this is the way to build the business and it's very encouraging to see the evolution of thought.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, thanks a lot.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Securities. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities: Thank you very much for taking my question. Could you give us an update on competitive bidding?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. So, what has been released so far is that, in fact competitive bidding will go through, so no real surprise there. That it's been reduced by one MSA. And that we would expect, I guess towards the end of the year, October timeframe that we should start finding out how it rolls out. So, not a lot of surprises there. What's interesting from a field perspective, in fact I was just with number of our senior sales team just yesterday and was just getting an update on what's going on, what's the buzz in the field around competitive bidding. It's just very dissimilar from what we saw a year ago. Year ago, there was just a lot of angst around what we are gong to do, how we are going to do on the part of the customers. This year, there is a calmness about it at this point in the marketplace, because people have been through it. I think they recognize that there was already 9.5% taken out of the pricing in the beginning of year, so there is going to be a bit more rationality I think in the marketplace. So, it's every different feel than it was last year.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities: Okay. And, could you comment on your uses of cash. I mean, so far you've been using it for share repurchases. Anything else you might have in mind?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. Yeah, I mean, let's say over the last 18 months, we've used about a $135 million to buyback our shares. We continue to think that that's a good investment. And so, as we still have some approval of shares that are remaining. We'll be finishing up the building and in this kind of environment, we keep our eyes open for a potential M&A or investment and technology kind of opportunities. So, we are very actively keeping our eyes open. But I will say, we are going to also be very careful not to let cash burn a hole on our pocket. We will do, we have always done, which is we will be very cautious, but very open minded when we look at opportunities in marketplace.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities: Okay. And then finally, can you comment on price, it's interesting to me that, it wasn't that long that we were talking about the market moving more and more towards lower priced products and with the introduction of better products from you guys, the market is shifting back towards higher price products.
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, you're absolutely right. But if it is to show that all crystal balls have a little bit of fuzziness to them. But this is a case, where I think that it's some of the fundamentals, have really been recognized by the market as I was mentioning before. This whole focus on compliance that CMS is driving is, really wonderful, because when push comes to shelve (ph) that's we're all here for, right? We are here for patients, we are here to help them manage their disorder, and nobody gets helped unless they're compliant. And the more parts of the channel that get rewarded by being the highest compliance oriented firms and that includes HMEs in the industry, then we all went, because most importantly, the patient wins impairs recognize that. So, overall pricing in the marketplace, I think it's sort of in that normalized range now. We always say there's sort of that 3 to 5% decline in an annual basis. You always see some high-end features that has a bit of more a law in it. I'd expect we're sort of in a steady state zone right now, it's a good place to be.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities: Sounds great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Hi, Kieran. If you can just... has there been any coverage on the insurance front with respect to lead testing extending coverage in circle?
Kieran Gallahue: Yes. So, we continue to see movement particularly on regional basis and piloting. So just as you see several different types of business models, I mentioned IDTFs, I mentioned certain HMEs. And of course, most importantly to out certain sleep docs, which have been piloting opportunities in home sleep testing. You also see some of the insurance providers on one side having come out with coverage decisions, most all of which favors some form of the use of home sleep testing, some type IV devices, some type III et cetera. Most of them are less restricted for instance, even at CMS. But you also see them regionally trying to figure out how to drive more activity to home sleep testing. It is not yet broad scale, it is truly piloting, for an example you see on a regional basis some, one firm I am thinking of is sending letters to many of its physicians that are very engaged in having recommendations for sleep test, saying: I'd like you to consider home sleep testing as part of the mix. So, there are cases where they are actually getting actively engaged. I think what they going to have to do is, this is why that you are the pilot, even the insurance companies are going to want to figure out the best way of implementing it, and they're going to test their way through, which is great. Because, as they do that, they can roll it out, they can roll out the most efficient programs across the nation. And therefore, it has the opportunity for success, and therefore for long-term impact on the business.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: I think this also on about half of the U.S. was probably coming for home sleep testing. So, they have the mood to the insurance doing their products and so forth.
Kieran Gallahue: Yes.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: All coverage; that number go up, I think to a month.
Kieran Gallahue: Yes. See, there is well over half the lives in the United States now can be covered or they could use home sleep testing. Again, depending which insurance you have there are different requirements, some want a type III, some want a type IV device, some want you to go to sleep docs, some want you... you can go to any treating physicians. So, it really varies, but that's, I think it's very natural sort of in the beginning of this type of transition. And I suspect over time that we'll see those things converge. So, yeah, I mean mine net is, I think it's where we expect to be and it's very positive.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Okay. Another question for Brett, you gave us some rest of the world (ph) split up for flow generation masks in constant currencies. Can you give it to us in actual, what the actual growth rates were?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, the headline international.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Yes.
Brett Sandercock: Flow gens was minus 5 and some marking accessories is minus 8.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: And SG&A was basically flat in the last quarter. Is that entirely related to the foreign currency, type of foreign currency movements or is this some addition sort of savings going on in the cost base?
Brett Sandercock: No, I mean that the flat result on the headline basis is pretty much the currency; and if you strip that out and you look at the constant currency terms, the SG&A increased by 13%.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just last on 9.5 % cost cut that went for Medicare, how much of that has ended up and borne by yourselves and how much for the delays?
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, first of all, the DMEs clearly get all of the impact, right? And it's just a matter of your negotiations with them. How much they do pass on or don't pass on. Remember when you go back a year ago, we were sort of at the tail end of some activity in the industry where there was quite a bit of price taken out of the industry from the supplier perspective, from our perspective. So there was really a lot of price movement ahead of that. And I think that's part of the reason why at this point, we were still sort of in that, more normalized environment of the 3 to 5% on an annualized basis.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks Kieran.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Securities. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys this is actually Benson on (ph) for Michael. First question for you guys in terms of your R&D spend, I think this is the third consecutive quarter, where you guys had the constant currency?
Kieran Gallahue: Hello. You're still on? Tania, it seems like we might have lost him.
Operator: Okay. Your next question will come from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Brett, it's a question for you, the gross margin guidance that you've given. We've clearly seen the LT development about quite significantly in the last little while. I just want to understand what assumptions you've made in giving that guidance range.
Brett Sandercock: I mean we've looked... on the forecast, we've looked at obviously bring the currency being a little bit higher than if you look to the average for the key around that sort of 66, $0.67 mark. And as you know the, you already know trying closer to mid 70s. But in terms... so we haven't really taken that into account, but while assigned that really... you're looking at a lag impact. Anyway, I remember we spoke about that two or three quarters ago. The benefit is lagged by inventory has to roll through manufacture and warehouse and then ultimately sell it. So, there would be some lag impact there anyway. So whatever the currency was, four, five, six months ago, what it is flowing through into Q4 for example. A sustained level of like that, we'd be pretty comfortable in the 70s to be frank. But that would have an impact that we'll been seen several quarter down the track.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Okay. So given the guidance range of 60 to 62 in 2009, you would be comfortable with where the dollar is now that you're still going to be in the range. Is that what I am to understand?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah I mean, we don't want to give guidance long way down the track. There's a lot of volatility and there is a lot of things that'll change. But if you look at it and look at the initiatives that we are undertaking in supply chain, in manufacturing, for example Singapore, in terms of product development pipeline, a lot of these will impact meaningfully in FY10. So we won't necessarily have a currency impact and I am confident we are definitely working on initiatives that can improve the margin with that currency.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: That's really helpful, thanks. And Kieran just a question SAIMI (ph) can we get an update on, I know you had the product with number one last around but also if could touch on that and then also touch on the big picture opportunity where you expect to or when you expect to bring those products into other markets?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. So the question is on the ventilation of course, on the volumes and all. So we can't express of course -- we continue to make progress with the let's call the SAIMI business of ResMed Paris business. We - a couple of quarters ago I think you're referring to we had a launch of the VS-III which we had sort of announced a few months early and it took our lucks a little bit in Q2. We have been shipping that product now. The product's doing quite well in the marketplace, it's received well. So we're feeling that we continue to make progress in that product range. And we look forward to continue to make progress on it. As far as when do we expand and I think in particular people are interested in when do we expand it into the United States marketplace; that really hasn't changed too in the proceeding months. We will not be - we do not plan on taking the current product series into the United States. We do plan on when we come out with a totally new platform, that's a couple of years hence. So we're not giving any specific dates on that but when that comes, that would be what we would expect to be the product introduced into the marketplace in the U.S. So in the foreseeable future, looking over the next 12 months, I wouldn't be building in any entry into the U.S.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Dan Herron (ph) with UBS. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning gentlemen. I just want to ask about the uptake of order machines in the U.S. and sort of magnitude change of its own I mean on our coming back couple of years all ways popular there now. So, as a rough percentage of sales what do orders represent in that market?
Kieran Gallahue: So, in the U.S. mix what would you say next, would you run that business or what would say in the U.S. rough percentages for generics?
Brett Sandercock: The order of 20 % customers the growing significantly this quarter year-on-year and I think the whole segment is growing and somewhat our share taking there as well, given some of the changes Ken talked about.
Kieran Gallahue: Yeah, so that's up from where we were few years ago, 12% obviously we don't have the ventilators and what not in that mix so it keeps up pretty strong, so that's a good movement overtime.
Unidentified Analyst: And to put you on the spot, can that continue to grow at that rate, the next sort of 12 months, or will it back off?
Brett Sandercock: We certainly don't try to predict on that sort of line item level. I think its obviously hard to but I think we can do is go back and talk about the fundamentals of the drivers. The fundamentals driving it are desire for the adaptive therapy. Also the fact that these kinds of products are the ones that we interface with the Regis tracks data center both the Elite products as well as this product we do have in fact even the Escape II. So we do have a number of products which can interface but this in particularly as a very convenient product and its one that supports driving of patient compliance at a time when the HMEs are very sensitive to the fact that compliance means getting paid alright. And so I think fundamentally while that continues and there is no suggestion of that backing off quite the opposite we may see other insurance companies which put in similar requirements overtime. I think that the fundamentals that drive these higher data oriented machines as well as the ones that support patient comfort and therefore health compliance are going to naturally play a more important role, all right. So we're not at the level where I think we want to predict exactly what percentage of flow generator sales. But the fundamentals remains strong and I don't see that changing.
Unidentified Analyst: okay. So in other words with, you're not talking percentages to drive this of the order switch up far from over?
Kieran Gallahue: Exactly.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Kieran Gallahue: You Bet.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kennedy, with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brian Kennedy - Jefferies & Co.: Hi this is Brian here for Peter. I want to ask about the clinical data, specifically can you talk a bit about the European AFE study, what the timing of the data release is and what are some of your goals and when you have the data, something it's positive?
Kieran Gallahue: Sure. So your question regards to the hard failure studies that we're engaged and its multinational, multi-site, heart failure study, we call survey chip. And it's the use of adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patients, Class 2, 3, and 4, heart failure patients and the end-point -- primary end-points are mortality and hospitalizations, and there's a whole series of secondary end-points. Adaptive servo-ventilation is a very unique product that, and it is very dependent on how you applied specific algorithms. And our algorithm which has been designed and tested over multiple years over thousands of patients is extremely robust. The study itself began last year. We continue to recruit like most clinical studies, you always have hope this things to go off like a shotgun and be then used on the recruitment side, and like normally you go through all your bumps in the beginning. But we've been actually have seen a nice improvement in recruitment rates over the last X number of months. And we're hearing of some very positive results both in those studies but also in some patients and, lets call it sister studies that also use adaptive servo-ventilation, where we've seen, as an example, of Class 4 heart failure patients which have been released from hospital and have been... have seen their health significantly improved, in fact they've been down graded from Class 4 down to Class 3, heart failure, I mean its just really, really dramatic improvements in some of these cases. So, these are multi-year studies, you shouldn't expect to see data from it, certainly not in this calendar year and then may be a bit of time after that. In fact before you even see some interim reports, that's the nature of these studies. But we're pleased with the progress to-date and particularly we're just pleased at the use and the understanding, and the acceptance of use of the ATS II product which is what we call it there in heart failure. And in fact, if you look at Japan as an example, where we have two distributors there selling the product under different brand names. And you look over the last year, one of the most impressive growth categories for us very significant has been the use of these adaptive servo-ventilation products by cardiologists, and in fact its been the cardiologist who are directly engaged with the patients in these cases. So, a very different model over there but indicative of the potential of this area so we remain extremely excited about the benefits that we can bring to that very costly commodity and the role that adaptive servo-ventilation can play in that.
Brian Kennedy - Jefferies & Co.: Thanks. I appreciate the response.
Kieran Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran Gallahue, for his final remarks.
Kieran Gallahue: Great. Well thanks, Tanya. Well thank you all for joining us today and as always, I want to thank our employees our ResMed employees all over the globe in various functions, has clearly been their stellar efforts to drive ResMed's performance. We are to some of our people and I am very proud of that team throughout the globe. We remain excited about our future, we've got high margin, exciting new products rolling our of the next 12 to 15 months, we've got a stellar balance sheet which in today's environment is something to be both proud of and very comfortable with. We've got significant operating cash-flow and as I mentioned an absolutely first rated team with strong execution. So, we've got lot of the things going on in the industry, a lot of good things going off the company and I look forward to update you again next quarter. Thanks everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation in today's conference. And this concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-02-05 16:30:00) =====

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2009 ResMed Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Eric; I’ll be your audio coordinator for today. Now at this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. We will facilitate the question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today, the company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of the conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as the projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor’s provision for Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which maybe accessed through the company's web site, at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Thank you, Eric. Good morning and welcome to ResMed’s second quarter earnings call. As with our previous calls, I’m going to begin the call with some more remarks. Then I’ll turn it over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through the numbers in more detail and then we’ll take your questions. Well, we had another very solid quarter, one that once again demonstrated the power of having a well-balanced geographically diversified company. We are pleased to report that global revenue for the second quarter of 2009 grew 10% or up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in the Americas accelerated by 23%, up sequentially from 16% in Q1. Rest of world revenue declined by 3% but in constant currency terms grew 8%. As expected, currency had a significant effect on ROW revenue. GAAP EPS increased 29% to $0.44. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was $0.01 better at $0.45. We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generator sales up 9% or 15% in constant currency, and mask segment growing at 12% during the quarter, which was 16% increase on a constant currency basis. We saw significant growth in all product segments of flow generators, but especially with our high-end flow generators, the S8 II Autoset and Elite II that we have launched in Q4, as well as our midrange S8 Escape II. Both revenue and unit volume increased across the flow generator product line. Sales of Americas flow generators were up 25% in Q2, a healthy increase from 14% growth in Q1. Our new Easy-Breathe technology is setting a new standard in the industry and is helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved noise levels, comfort and performance. It’s notable to mention that the fastest growing segment of the US flow generator business in percentage terms has been our Autoset product line and that trend continues. Our newly introduced bi-level devices in the smaller S8 box continued to gain momentum in Q2. This brings the Easy-Breathe Technology into our bi-level product line and we’re excited about the potential upside with its second quarter sales now recorded. The VPAP product line continues to exceed our expectations with significant growth in the quarter with the launch of the VPAP S, and we continue to gain market share in this important high-margin flow generator market segment. As I speak today, our entire new line of VPAP devices are now available in all major global markets. And over the next few quarters, we will continue to execute on our strategy to differentiate our innovative technology with these new market-leading products. In addition, as a result of changing product mix in this category, our gross margins are improving. Once again, we posted double-digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter. New product introductions included the Activa LT and Swift LT for Her. These redesigned LT masks are smaller, wider and more streamlined versions of their predecessors. We expect the Swift LT for Her product will provide a comfortable and quiet solution for our female patients, as this is the first and only gender-specific product on the market. This is an important market for us. According to some of our Sleep Lab partners, women now represent 30% to 50% of their newly diagnosed patients. And the Activa LT is less intrusive [ph] masks which gives patients superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. The simplicity of this provides an opportunity for our HME providers to accommodate a wider number of patients with a single mask. So with these new masks in the global marketplace in Q3, we remain focus on growing market share with high-margin industry leading products. Looking forward over the next 18 months, our pipeline of products is the most robust it has been in the company’s history and we plan to launch a series of new masks and flow generators over that time period. In addition, towards the end of fiscal 2009, we plan to introduce the ApneaLink Plus, our type III home diagnostic device that will meet existing reimbursement and physician requirements. Throughout calendar 2009, we’ll be watching home testing carefully and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms. We are working closely with our sleep position partners to make home testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. Encouragingly, gross margin improved in Q2, benefiting from a favorable product mix driven by high-end flow generators and masks as well as our margin improvement plan gaining traction. We’re confident that we will continue to improve gross margin in fiscal year 2009 as we further penetrate markets with out new products and we continue to leverage cost efficiencies across our global organization. Once again, we had strong performance in operating cash flow, which came in at $56.5 million demonstrating our commitment to strong operating performance and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q2 of over $320 million. Finally, I’ll touch on the current economic environment as I know it is a question in everybody’s mind today. As you can see from our Q2 results, we have not felt the level of impact experienced by some other sectors of the healthcare community or for that matter, the general business community. We think this is because of the continued patient and medical community awareness and the central role that quality of sleep and sleep disorder breathing plays in the overall health in the continuing peer reviewed literature published supporting CPAP as the gold standard treatment for sleep disorder breathing. That being said, we recognize the need to continually monitor the market and the economy, and we plan to do so. Finally on the market development front, we have just completed a calendar year that bodes well for the future of this market. There continues to be validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays in the very serious co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. As a reminder, the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines refers to the importance of identifying and treating sleep disorder breathing in heart failure patients. Also, the International Diabetes Federation consensus statement on sleep apnea published last June concluded that type II diabetic should be evaluated to determine if SDB is present and they went on to note that CPAP treatment is the gold standard therapy. These influential global bodies confirmed what we have been communicating on the critical need to identify and treat sleep disorder breathing in patients suffering from two of the most chronic, fast-growing and most costly diseases in the world. ResMed remains well positioned to serve this market as it expands. All right, now over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the P&L and then we’ll come back and take your questions. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Thanks, Kieran. I’ll briefly run through our December quarter results in a little more detail. So as Kieran mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $223 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year. And as expected, unfavorable currency movements reduced our Q2 revenues by approximately $11.1 million. In constant currency terms, the revenue increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Income from operations for the quarter was $43.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, and net income for the quarter was $33.9 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, our earnings per share for the quarter was $0.45. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.8%, up sequentially from Q1 of FY09 reflecting favorable product mix, manufacturing improvements, and foreign currency movements. The product mix impact was largely attributable to the acceleration of sales growth, both in the bi-level range, and also our Autoset devices particularly in the domestic market. Manufacturing initiatives, including our continuous improvement program, are also positively impacting margins. Additionally, towards the end of the quarter, we saw the initial benefits from the depreciation of the Australian dollar. This currency impact together with our ongoing margin improvement initiatives in areas such as supply chain, manufacturing and product development, should see further improvement in our gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses for the quarter came in at $70.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, improved to 31% compared to the year ago figure of 33%. The modest growth in headline [ph] SG&A expenses reflects the full impact of the depreciation of international currencies against the US dollar. R&D expenses for the quarter were $14.9 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 27% over the prior quarter. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue is 7% and again that was consistent with the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the 6% to 7% range for the second half of 2009. We will continue to invest in product innovation throughout the economic cycle. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.7 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $6.8 million. During the quarter, we also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation. Turning now to revenues in more detail, overall America sales were $123.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks with an extra [ph] contribution from our new bi-level range which is in the S8 box, and also continued strong sales of Autoset devices. So the outside of the Americas totaled $99.9 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year and as expected outside of the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particular the depreciation of the Euro against the US dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas were also impacted this quarter by lower sales of our VS ventilation range. Breaking out revenues between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales increased by 25% over the prior year, while masks and other increased by 21%. The revenues outside the Americas, flow generator sales decreased by 3% over the prior year while masks and other decreased by 1%. However, in constant currency terms, flow generators outside the Americas increased by 8%, and while masks and other increased by 10%. And looking at it on a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 9% over the prior year quarter, and masks and other increased by 12%. In constant currency terms, we saw a quite balanced growth with flow generator sales increasing by 15% and masks and other increasing by 16%. Cash flow from operations was a robust $66.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings, improved working capital and lower corporate tax payments. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27.4 million including $19.5 million in building construction costs, such as with the construction of our new headquarters in San Diego. We expect to incur further construction and fit-out [ph] cost of approximately $31 million over the balance of fiscal year 2009 with the building completion expected towards the end of the fiscal year. Depreciation and amortizations for the quarter totaled $11.7 million. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 56,000 shares at a consideration of $2 million, as part of our ongoing buyback program. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares out of a total approved buyback of 8 million. ResMed ended second quarter fiscal year 2009 in excellent financial shape. Our balance sheet remains very strong and is conservatively geared. At December 31, total assets stood at $1.3 billion and net equity was $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of external debt totaled $168 million. I would now like to make some comments in relation to currency movements and their expected impact on FY09 second half results, assuming current exchange rates. Firstly, we will continue to experience year-on-year currency headwinds in relation to group revenue. In Q3, we estimate a currency headwind of between $15 million and $20 million, while in Q4 it is estimated to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. Conversely, our operating expenses will continue to benefit from the depreciation of international currencies relative to the US dollar. This benefit is already reflected in our Q2 result and therefore it provides an indicative base for our operating expense run rate over the next few quarters. Finally, from Q3 onwards, the full benefit of the Australian dollar depreciation should be reflected in our gross margin. There are clearly many factors that impact gross margin. However, on balance, we expect gross margin to improve relative to our second quarter gross margin. In summary, we expect currency movements to have a positive impact on our net income in the second half of FY09 and we expect net income to grow faster than our constant currency revenue growth. I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Great. Well, thank you, Brett, and certainly, we’re quite pleased with the performance of the company and the team during this last quarter. And with that, why don’t we turn it over for questions?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Hey, guys. Congratulations.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Thanks, Dave.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Just a quick question on gross margin in the quarter. What was mix versus currency, the impact there? Can you split that out for us?
Kieran T. Gallahue: I’ll turn it over to Brett in a second, but in that sense, we had a couple of different moving pieces that helped us improve margin. The basics are really what we laid out three quarters ago when we laid out what our margin improvement program was. We’ve seen some significant positive impact through the cost reduction exercise that we’ve gone through throughout the company; the high-valued products that we’ve been launching, both on the bi-levels and the masks, have been quite favorable; and obviously, the ForEx is beginning to have a positive impact there as well. The offsets to that were we haven’t quite annualized the ASP drops that came through in the fourth quarter of last year, so that was – even though the market has regulated itself in the pricing and we’ve been very pleased with the pricing stability in the market, we still need to go through that annualization process. That was sort of the offset. Brett, you have anything to add to that?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. I mean, that’s exactly right. If you look at the product mix and the FX, they have rationally equal positive impacts on the margin with smaller negative zone in terms of ASP declines, which are pretty normal, and small negative on geographic mix, obviously with the really strong growth in the Americas, (inaudible) to the Americas a little bit. But you take all those into account and you sort of end up with that 50 basis point improvement, but certainly product mix and FX were equally prominent in their contribution.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Okay, thanks. And then, I guess another question for you, Brett. You said in Q3, we should expect gross margin improvement versus the second quarter. I think everyone’s expecting that, but are you willing to give us some direction there? Are you looking for another 50 basis points sequential or how should we be thinking about that?
Brett Sandercock: I’m always cautious on margin because of the multiple impacts on the margin, but if I’m looking forward, I do think an expansion and what we’re looking at – of that order is certainly possible without virtually giving you an exact number. Certainly, I think it’s going to improve. If 50 basis points or more feasible? Yes, it certainly is.
Kieran T. Gallahue: We’ve been asked a couple of quarters ago about our ability by the end of the year to get back to 60% gross margins, and we said we believe that we could do that and we continue to believe that we can do that by year-end.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And just if I could sneak one last one in here, it looks like OUS constant currency growth was a little bit lower. I think it was a little bit lower last quarter too. I’m just wondering if there’s a certain geography or something, just some macro trend you could point out or give us a little bit of color there?
Kieran T. Gallahue: No. ROW is an aggregation of lots and lots of different countries and all have their different idiosyncrasies. The real impact this quarter was more on the ventilation line. We had introduced a product, a new ventilation product that Brett referred to, the VS III and we had introduced it during Q2, but we only began shipping it really this quarter. And so, you had some customers that were holding off on shipment of it, and so it’s little things like that that can add a couple of percentage points to the growth that got carved off; but we’re still pleased. Certainly, we had the currency headwind, but constant currency growth at 8% and a great balance of the Americas 23%.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: All right, yes. Great quarter, guys. Thank you.
David Clair – Piper Jaffray: Thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bye with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Company: Hey, guys. Thanks. On the US, the AutoSet and the VPAP, maybe you could give us a little more color on mix and the contribution versus units or anything you can give us there?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. We don’t go into the great details but we can give you some color on it though. Look, they’re both doing extremely well, is the short answer to it. The S8 II on the PAP side, so when you look at both the AutoSet and the Elite as an example that we were introducing towards the end of last fiscal year, have continued to perform quite well. And obviously the impact of the bi-levels, we released most of them over the summer but continue to release product throughout Q2, so you saw that thing ramping up as we’re able to get to our various customers. They’re all doing extremely well. I can’t point to one and say it’s all that product or another product. The Easy-Breathe motor technology, particularly how quiet it is and how it improves performance, is being recognized by the industry. In the bi-level side, this is the first time that we’ve taken the bi-level in the big box and brought it down to the small box. It is a meaningful change to the customers and they’re recognizing that. There’s also some other aspects of this. There’s been the data-capable products that we have, particularly those that are the data capability in the AutoSet, the Elite, and the bi-levels. With some of the changes going on at CNS, they’ve raised the awareness and the need to have data managed the way that we manage it. It’s more cost effective the way we do it. It protects the revenue the way that we do it and customers are recognizing that and rewarding us with their business.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Company: I guess what we’re trying to get at is maybe how much runway there is left on that? Could you give us – maybe compared to internationally? I mean, do you have – is it the mix between the products? Is it halfway with where you are internationally? Is it 25%? Can you just give us maybe a sense that way or no?
Kieran T. Gallahue: No. I think the historical mix between – if you’re asking between the bi-levels and other flow generators, has remained relatively consistent. I would expect over the coming quarters that you’ll see a higher mix towards bi-levels simply because we made the greatest leap in bi-levels moving it from the S7 box down to the S8 small box and that easy. So, they’re both extremely well, but if I was going to say, I don’t know how many points that’s going to be a difference, but I could see bi-levels playing a bigger role as we move forward.
Peter Bye – Jefferies & Company: Okay, great. I guess that’s my question and follow-up, so I’ll get back in queue.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Okay. All right, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: All right. Thanks very much guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am just interested in what is sort of happening with the underlying market and I guess, in particular, if we'd sort of reflect on the numbers we can get out of what we saw with Respironics. It seems to me that you guys are probably taking some market share. If there’s any comment you can add on Apria?
Kieran T. Gallahue: I think the last couple of quarters, we’ve been talking about the Americas market has been growing around that 15%, maybe a point or so less on the revenue side, a little above on the volume side. The markets remained strong throughout the quarter and that would suggest that we are absolutely gaining share and I think we’re gaining share for multiple reasons. The team is executing extremely well. We have great new product flow that we were just describing a moment ago and we have seen some competitive wins both at mid-size accounts as well as some of the major accounts that you just referred to that helped us gain traction and share. So, there is not one reason that we’re seeing the performance improve; we are seeing it across the business.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: And in terms of how much further that got to go, there’s still opportunity with those accounts?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Sure. Yes, we’ve got opportunities at both large accounts and the mid-size accounts, and we’ll continue to push that barrel.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.
Kieran T. Gallahue: You bet. Eric?
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please proceed.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions and also special thank you to Matt Borer. I know you’re probably there listening. We really all appreciate your help and welcome to Conney [ph]. Just a couple of quick ones here. First, on the new products, I know, Kieran, you mentioned your pipeline is robust. I don’t want to jump ahead of ourselves and I know for competitive reasons, you’re not going to give too much, but it seems like your pipeline for newer products is coming quicker than historical, from what I remember. It seems like you already mentioned new generators. Is it just iterations or are you talking about new lines that you guys are already working on and we’re starting to see new products sort of come out quicker?
Kieran T. Gallahue: You’re right; we’re not going to give specifics on the timing. What we are referring to is over the next 18 months and we did refer to both masks and flow generators, and it will be a mix. There will be some platform changes and there will be platform extensions, so it is going to be all of the above. As far as the time to market, I would agree with you. I think we’ve seen some very good improvement for a number of different reasons. One, you’ve seen that we continue to invest very heavily in innovation. We are strong believers that there is an enormous amount of innovation to be brought to bear on this marketplace and that there’s patient meaningful and customer meaningful innovation that could be brought to bear in this marketplace. And so, we feel strongly that we’re going to need to keep the foot on the accelerator and spend behind that. We’re also spending smarter. We started these strategic business units about a year-and-a-half ago led by Don Darkin, Mick Farrell, and Stein Jacobsen. And they have done, I just think, a fantastic job of organizing the pipeline and energizing the team and focusing the team on execution and I think it is going to pay dividends as we move forward.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Great. And then a follow-up totally separate. On SEM, I always ask this just related to the US or any new products, obviously you just launched the new one in Europe. I don’t know if that means we are coming to the US or anything like that. Can you give us an update?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. So, we continue to make quite a bit of progress at the SEM organization or, as we call it now, the ResMed Paris organization. The leadership there has been outstanding. The team is motivated. We have done – and the team has done an excellent job of integrating not only the Paris site but other parts of the organization in order to drive forward product improvement and product development. The products that we’re introducing now remain focused predominantly on Europe but also some of the Asian marketplaces. We continue to believe that the entry into the Americas market is out about two years or so.
Joshua Zable – Natixis: Great. Thanks very much guys. Congratulations.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Thanks guys. Just a question, Kieran, on the autosetting category. Obviously, it is the fastest growing category in the US. Do you think that is simply a case that the product is taking share out of the other autosetting devices on the market or that that category itself is growing as a total proportion of the market?
Kieran T. Gallahue: It is all of the above. I believe we are taking share and I believe that the market is continuing to recognize the power and the efficacy and the cost effectiveness of applying autosetting technologies to patient care.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: And I guess a follow-up to that. Has the price premium that you realized on autosetting devices changed or is that still holding?
Kieran T. Gallahue: It remains the premium priced product in our CPAP/APAP line and the premiums are – that’s sort of a moving average over the last couple of years. There has been some ASP reduction in all products over the last several years. Certainly, the Autoset has also experienced that. I’d say on percentage basis, probably not that big a change. A dollar basis, obviously, it would be less as the ASPs change. But really I think it is about the power of the autosetting technology. We have done quite a bit in the last year to improve the way that we communicate the difference. In the past, we talked about it quite a bit. We tried to educate using clinical papers as an example and those are powerful tools and they are very accurate and substantial tools, but we’ve also found ways that we could use tools that can demonstrate for individuals exactly how those algorithms are working and how they compare to competitive technologies, and we’ve enabled our sales reps to be able to do that demonstration. So, we found that the more the customer understands the difference between our autosetting technologies and others, and the difference between autosetting technologies and CPAP, the more prone they are to consider Autoset as a solution for their patients.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: So, this is completely independent of home sleep testing, possibly driving a shift towards APAP?
Kieran T. Gallahue: I think at this point, it is independent, but I think you make a good point that as home sleep testing rolls out, we believe strongly that the autosetting technology can play a very important role in cost effectively delivering the home sleep testing solution over time, so I think that is yet to come, the benefit of that.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Jim – Canaccord Adams: Hi, this is Jim [ph] for Jason. Two quick questions. One is on international, can you give us your estimate for international market growth?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. Historically, what we’ve said is we believe the market internationally is growing somewhere in that 10% to 15% range and we’ve said in the last several quarters, we think it is probably closer to the 10% range. I think that we feel comfortable saying it has stayed around that level and if it wasn’t for just a slight timing bump in the ventilation side of the business, I think you would have seen it there.
Jim – Canaccord Adams: Okay. And the second is just on the macro economic environment. I know you said you didn't see any in this calendar Q4, but qualitatively are you hearing anything from Sleep Lab in terms of them decreasing any of their estimates or beds or anything like that?
Kieran T. Gallahue: It is a question and, obviously, we got a lot of these questions over our Q3 or last quarter, as so many different businesses and so many different healthcare businesses were impacted by the economy. We said then we continue to believe, which is we simply were not seeing the impact that others in the healthcare community and general business environment were seeing. So, I guess my summary is we remain cautiously optimistic. Keep an eye on it, but feeling good at this point.
Jim – Canaccord Adams: All right, thanks a lot. Good quarter guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes, sure can.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Great. Kieran, maybe two questions if I may. First, maybe one for Brett. Can you isolate the trend in gross margin by the end of the fiscal year and just forgetting about currency, I know there’s a lot of moving pieces, but absent that, you are still comfortable with getting north of the 60% range or is it going to take you a little longer to get some of the benefits from mix and manufacturing?
Brett Sandercock: The manufacturing improvements obviously take longer term to flow through because they've roll through inventory and then inventory has to be sold and so on. But we’re actively working on all of those and certainly not all of that would be through in this fiscal year, certainly as you look through FY 2010 you’ll certainly see benefits and you have things – even Singapore manufacturing for example, as that ramps up, that will still improve our cost base, particularly if you look through FY 2010. There are a number of actions we’re undertaking independent of the currency that is purely designed to improve our margins and to make us more competitive. And then, overlying that obviously is margin improvement from the currency which has really been a headwind for us for the last few years as the currency ramped up the Aussie dollar. It’s really coming back to what you consider more historical levels or historical range. I mean, the (inaudible) $0.90 happened last year and didn’t happen since the mid-80s over that level. So it was really aberration I believe in the Aussie dollar. But having said that, I’m not trying to predict currency; they are extremely volatile. We’re in a range that’s probably more of a historical context.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay. That sounds focused. Obviously, it’s a multi-year process to push that gross margin but the aspect of the question I’m really asking is, two years out, Kieran, structurally, if you didn’t get any more tailwinds from currency, for example, where would the gross margin be in your view? Would it be static or would it be lower or higher?
Kieran T. Gallahue: We still believe that we have opportunities for margin expansion. If I go back to what we talked about two or three quarters ago, about the various areas that we were focusing on to drive margin expansion and part of it was cost savings. Part of it is design of products and the way that we design new generations of products. Part of it is cost savings throughout via the system overall and of course, it’s also investing in innovation because one of the key ways of maintaining margins over time is bringing innovative products to markets that means something to the patient and means something to the customer. It’s one of the reasons why we continue to invest so heavily within R&D and why we’re so pleased with the progress that we are seeing with the SPU’s leadership of those teams. So we’re not counting on currency at all.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: I understand. It's a combination of product mix in those manufacturing synergies, but what everybody is really trying to figure out is, is there going to be yet another structural shift in price over the next two to three years beyond your ability to out-innovate that would structurally hurt the gross margins? I understand what you’re trying to do with the business and you’re controlling the things you can control. That’s sort of what I’m trying to understand a little bit better.
Kieran T. Gallahue: My viewpoint – I understand, of course, none of us have crystal balls, right? But, if you look at historically this industry and you look where it has moved, there’s a couple of very positive signals in my opinion for this industry. One is the price movements we saw last year were quite unusual. The kind of things you only see maybe every five years at best. The second part is I think it has helped that we’ve had Phillips introduce itself into this industry. It’s a business that historically has been known to compete on innovation and market expansion, not on price, right? Now, you’ve got two players that represent a good 80% of the market who both believe in market expansion, in driving innovation, and in creating value within that industry. I think that’s a good thing for the long-term health of this marketplace. And on top of that, you have this continued recognition and understanding of the role that sleep-disordered breathing plays in very, very costly co-morbidities such as diabetes and congestive heart failure, right? So, I think we’re pushing in the right places. The industry structure has evolved in a very positive way. We’ve got the innovation and the product line that, in my opinion, serves this market very well and suggests that we should see a very solid, very comfortable market here in the coming years.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Okay. That’s helpful and the last thing I’ll ask is the international growth, about 8%, that sort of falls at the lower end of the range of expectations for that business over time, what were the issues, if any, in the quarter? Was this sort of a difficult comparison or is Germany coming back? Just maybe talk about international events.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Sure. So we’ve got some markets that are doing incredibly well in the international market. Japan and France did very well in the last quarter. UK did very well. So we’ve got some real big winners throughout that. The big issue we had last quarter as I reflected before was ventilation. Remember ventilation is really mostly a European business, a little bit in Asia; it really doesn’t influence the Americas much at all. We had that VSIII introduction where we didn’t start shipping in this quarter, so you just had a sort of a short-term anomaly there and I think that the ventilation business overall is one that we’re certainly going to keep a close eye on simply because it’s a loaner pool market and there’s always the opportunity to look at depreciation cycles of these products, etc., but it was really an isolated situation that we think we can bounce back from.
Ben Andrew – William Blair: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Matson – Wachovia Capital Markets: Hi, question on your R&D spending. It was up quite a bit on a constant currency basis. Just wondering if we can expect it to stay that high for the remainder of the fiscal year? And if the Australian dollar was to strengthen, is that something that you could reign back in if you needed to?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question. So, remember in the R&D line, in addition to core product development, we also have the SERVE-HF clinical study and that’s just to remind everybody that is the clinical study that we have been engaged in multinational, multisite, that is focused on the use of adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patients. So it’s sort of rolling through and it wasn’t in any material way on the base year, so that represents part of that growth that we’re seeing and certainly like all clinical studies, those are the things that you can review from time to time and make decisions on what you want to do with them. As far as the rest of the R&D line, we certainly have the ability to adjust that should we decide but I'll reflect back on the comment that Brett made. Our intention is to continue to invest in R&D throughout the economic cycle. We strongly believe that innovation is critical in this marketplace to continue expanding it, to maintain very solid and appropriate margins throughout this, and for us to enjoy the market share that we enjoy. So, we certainly do not have any intentions of taking the foot off the accelerator, although we always have that option should we decide to exercise it.
Michael Matson – Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay and then with regards to the economy, I know that you’re not seeing an impact so far, but do you think you would see a greater risk with the US or the international markets? And with your product segments mask versus flow generators, which of the two do you think of the two are more economically sensitive, if you will?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Real hard question to answer, right? What we’ve seen throughout the globe is we’re not seeing that the economy and the challenge because it’s already affecting people throughout the globe, we’re not seeing differential impact in one market versus another. I suppose you could look at Australia which is a very, very small market for us but that’s a private pay market. Conjecture, I’d say maybe that would be one that might be a bit more under pressure. But in the other markets, we are seeing reimbursements (inaudible) government. We are seeing reimbursements through a mixture of government and private pay, so I think there are some pretty common dynamics there and again, I think that’s worked in our favor.
Michael Matson – Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Herron [ph] from UBS. Please proceed.
Dan Herron – UBS: Good morning. I just want to ask a question in regards to the mix shift. We’ve been hearing a little bit about the changes of compliance rules in the US and it’s driving home healthcare dealers towards the higher-end products with a bit of data logging capability. Just wondering if you can comment on that and where it is headed (inaudible) or is there more to come?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. That’s a great question. There is a lot of good things that are happening from the perspective of product mix in that category. So basically, we refer [ph] to particularly in the Americas, the US, CMS was stepping up its requirements on how it was requiring HMEs to collect and report compliance and how compliance was defined. Quite frankly, that plays in our favor and it plays in the favor of HMEs that focus on good care too. So, the idea of that is you need to be able to collect this information in order to prove compliance over time. The way that our systems are designed, when you download the information for instance with a card, all right, the information continues to reside on the flow generator itself. So, let’s say you measured compliancy, you have your card and something happens to it. It breaks, it bends, it falls in the garbage, whatever. You lose $8. Our competitors, when you download the information onto their card, it stays with the card. So that card gets lost. If it fails, if something happens to it, it’s gone. The information is gone. So the cost is not $8, it’s the ability to capture the revenue that’s associated with the billing of that. So that might be an $800 or a $1,000 card that you just lost, in essence, right. So the way that we’ve designed our systems with that redundancy, that natural redundancy has been recognized by HMEs because they realize it reduces their risk in today’s environment. So very, very positive changes as far as we’re concerned.
Don Herron – UBS: And just potentially as follow-up, is there potential with this rule changes and with the move toward the data logging higher-end devices, is there a potential for the lower-end manufacturers in the market who don’t have that capability to be pushed out margin-wise at a time?
Kieran T. Gallahue: I think it’s a difficult place to be if you’re in that part of the market. This is – you got a bit of Moore’s Law going on here and you’ve got systems that are highly capable. A good example of that is the bi-levels, the auto bi-levels which is an absolutely phenomenal product. We’re hearing rave reviews from sleep physicians who in some cases have dramatically increased, as in 4x, the percentage of their patients that they’re putting on bi-level because the auto bi-level is so comfortable, all right, very, very powerful. The VPAP Auto 25 is what I’m talking about. Now, the low-end machines where you are just not collecting data, you’re not able to provide the information that is required by CMS and likely to be followed by other insurance companies, you can't do it, then you can’t even be considered. So these changes play to our favor and we’re already seeing that happening.
Don Herron – UBS: Okay, thanks.
Kieran T. Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Stanton with ABN AMRO. Please proceed.
David Stanton – ABN AMRO: Thanks guys. Could you tell us if there’s any updates or do you have any more color on the (inaudible) position in the US in terms of, I guess, private insurers and/or infrastructure? Any color on that would be appreciated, thanks.
Kieran T. Gallahue: I’m sorry. Was that home sleep testing you’re asking about?
David Stanton – ABN AMRO: Yes, that’s right.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes, great. So this has been a fascinating and a critical last 12 months for home sleep testing in the United States. I mean, it’s always important for us to sit back for a second and reflect over the last year. And basically, what occurred in the last year is CMS has said home sleep testing is here. It’s here to stay, and now it’s a matter of how we roll it out, and when it gets rolled out. And so, it’s was very critical year last year. And of course, on the private payer side, four of the five largest private payers also jumped onboard. So, CIGNA, Aetna, Anthem, United, and of course, Medicare, all have recognized and have accepted home sleep testing. So what we’re looking at this year is, there is a lot of pilots, I guess is the best way to say it, that are going to be rolling out throughout this year. It’s going to be the year of 'how' sleep testing. So last year was the year of 'if' sleep testing and clearly the answer was yes. This is the year of 'how'. And you see our partners, for instance in the sleep community, trying to enact what our Chairman has been talking about for years which is the hub-and-spoke model. They have been trying to live that hub-and-spoke model and understand how they can, for instance, recapture leakage in the system and let me tell you what I mean by that. About 30% of patients who get a referral into a Sleep Lab, never show up. That is an historical number; nothing new about that. And the reason they don’t show up frequently is because either they don’t want to go through the overnight sleep study or there is something to do with the economics, etc. Something tells them that they’re not going to show up. That's a perfect use of home sleep testing, so we have certain sleep positions that have been saying, “You know what, we’re going to go to those referral sources and we’re going to try to use home sleep testing as part of that mix." And they’re doing so recognizing that they’re going end up with more PSGs as well, because a number of those patients who get home sleep tested, either because of co-morbidities or because of complexities, are still going to need a PSG. So they’re looking at implementing it that way. You now also have other healthcare providers that are trying to understand what their role may be; independent diagnostic testing facilities, these IDTFs. You probably are going to see PCPs, the primary care positions and to a certain extent other medical specialties taking a look at it. So, I think this is going to be the year where we’re going to be watching a lot of these models rolling out. And you’re going to see technologies that are introduced that will help support that process.
David Stanton – ABN AMRO: Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Helen Cameron with Citi. Please proceed.
Helen Cameron – Citigroup: Good morning guys. I’ve got two questions that’s around the pricing environment, revenue. I guess the 9.5% cuts come through went off now [ph]. How should we be factoring this into our projections going forward? Do we assume you get 2% less from the bank there? And also on the relationship with HMEs and yourselves, is there sort of a horse trading going on there as to who gets more in terms of the dollars booked in the bank going forward because clearly there, I guess, are some issues going on there, as the HME gets more involved in patient management and get more leverage of our [ph] end user?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Good question. If we go back to what you were referring to, which is the Medicare cut of 9.5% which went across a number of different products, not just sleep products, including oxygen and med neb and diabetes supplies, etc. That was all announced back in July and actually there was a sigh of relief from the HMEs when that came through because it took a lot of the questions about what is going to occur in it and it make it very specific. So, it is not new news starting January 1; that has already been sort of worked into the behavior of the customer dynamic over the last six months. One of the thing that is interesting about these kinds of cuts is the last time there was a significant cut on oxygen and med nebs, which was about three years ago, it actually preceded one of the biggest growth spikes that we had seen on sleep side and the reason is, these HME are businesses. They've got a lot of fixed infrastructure; these big logistics teams, be it in personnel or be it in buildings, etc., and they need to grow their way out of these kinds of challenges. So when they look around their business, what are they going to do? Look to oxygen to grow? That is more a zero sum game or it's market stealing that is going on there. They look at sleep and they see the opportunity for expansion. So we have had a lot of conversations just as we did three years ago when you started to involve more of these HME about, "How do I win in this environment? Tell me how I sell sleep even more? Can you help me with materials so that I go to my referring physicians and I can teach them about the links with diabetes? I can teach them about the links of cardiovascular disease. Help me understand on how I can ship more masks. How do I get from shipping 1 every 16 months to a customer to try and replace on a more appropriate cycle that insurance supports because it is good medicine? How do I do that and what are some of the tools?" So these changes where you look at them and on the surface, they could say – you can step back and say, "Oh-oh, what is coming down here?" The reality of what we have already lived several years ago and what we are hearing from our customers is, we actually think this is an opportunity for stimulating growth because HMEs are businesses and they need to grow themselves out of this.
Helen Cameron – Citigroup: Are you seeing any shift – just as a follow-up on med, on the relative sharing of the pie between yourselves and the distributors? Are they getting tougher in terms of sharing the dollar revenue at the end of the day?
Kieran T. Gallahue: No. There hasn't been any changes in their behavior and certainly not with change in the Medicare pricing.
Helen Cameron – Citigroup: Right. So what you are seeing about the revenue line and the 9.5% cut? It is really I shouldn't add another 2% – sorry, reduce that by 2% going forward into 2009 because it is basically already been absorb in renegotiations post July?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Yes. Historically, we have always said that in this marketplace, you look somewhere 3% to 4% price decline over the course of the year and then some years, it is bigger and some years, it is less. Clearly what we experienced last year was a bigger year and I think that puts us in good position as we come into this year. So I'd say there is nothing unusual about what's going on right now.
Helen Cameron – Citigroup: Okay, thanks for your help.
Kieran T. Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Matthew Prior – Merrill Lynch: Good day guys. Just a first question in terms of some visibility emerging of US Health Policy with the new administration. Can you just comment on increased coverage, especially in terms of diagnosis and how that would affect the market in the US and also in terms comparative effectiveness with funding for studies (inaudible) $700 million?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Change in the administration, the short answer is, certainly at this point we are not seeing anything that changes for our industry. Like everything else, we'll have to keep a watching brief on it but certainly nothing new news with the change in the administration at this point. Most of the changes that we’ve seen from a legislative point in the last year have been actually quite positive. I think the biggest change we’ve seen out of the legislative, certainly coming down from CMS has been the introduction and the validation of the use of home sleep testing, and it’s being pushed because what they’re trying to do is to make sure that they are spending appropriately, that you’re using the most cost-effective way of reaching the most patients possible. The good news for sleep is that we are involved in some of the most expensive co-morbidities on the planet. You look at diabetes, you look at heart failure, we are right in the center of that. And the data that came out within this last year, or the validation because the data has been coming out for years, quite frankly, but the validation of the data by world bodies, International Diabetes Federation, European Society of Cardiology have said, “You know what, CPAP is the gold standard treatment for sleep disorder breathing. It is a cost-effective way of getting in there and treating these patients. You should be looking for these breathing disorders in those patients.” So, I think the way that things are playing out here bode well for us because we are good healthcare and by treating sleep disorder breathing, it is a cost-effective way of treating patients. We are, in my opinion, and in our opinion, we are where you want to be in healthcare right now.
Matthew Prior – Merrill Lynch: Thanks. And just tying that into my follow-up question, you had a very strong US quarter and obviously, that was devices and masks. I know that there was obviously both upgrade sales in there from existing patients and new patients also. If it’s upgrade sales, then it echoes to compliance and that’s great for, obviously, home testing and if it is the key patients, it increases the installed base. Can you just give us some indication as to of that growth, which was greater? Upgrade sales from existing patients or new patients coming onboard?
Kieran T. Gallahue: We really don’t have visibility to break that out for you. We sell to the HMEs and the sleep physicians. They jealously guard their patient – as they should, their patient lists, and so we don’t get into discussions in order to get disclosure about what percentage is to existing customers versus to new customers. I will say that over time, existing customers are becoming more and more important and that’s a good thing because as the pie of diagnosed population continues to grow, they represent the opportunity for annuity streams; and of course, those annuity streams, primarily mask and accessories, are the highest profitability parts of our product line.
Matthew Prior – Merrill Lynch: Thanks. A follow-up on that one. Do you track, obviously, the metric of masks per device as a metric of compliance?
Kieran T. Gallahue: It’s a faulty measure of compliance because you can use masks and flow generators independently of one another; you don’t sell on a one-to-one basis. So using that as a proxy can be a very confusing way and, in fact, a misleading way of making some assumptions on that ratio.
Matthew Prior – Merrill Lynch: Sure. Thanks, guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue: You bet.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Todd Harrison [ph] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Todd Harrison – Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question. You mentioned the ApneaLink product that now meets regulatory requirement. I’m just wondering, is that an area that you’re now looking to compete more heavily in the home diagnostic side with home diagnosis coming through?
Kieran T. Gallahue: Well, we’ve had the ApneaLink product now for a number of years. In fact, it was developed by our German subsidiary and we’ve continued to expand off that base, so our intention is to continue investing in that platform. It is a very sensitive, very accurate device, incredibly easy to use, and the advantage that it has is many of the home sleep testing devices that exist today were very complex devices that the manufacturers are trying to strip down in order to meet the, let’s say, the type III as an example, the type III testing requirements, which means they have the infrastructure of a much more expensive unit. We, on the other hand, have built from the simplistic and have been adding feature sets over time. In fact, the type III device, we intend to introduce before the end of the year. So, it puts us in a very good position because it’s both easy to use, which is what you want in a home care environment. It is very accurate, very sensitive, which is what you want out of a device, and it is very cost effective. So it positions as well. But when push comes to shove, diagnostics from our perspective is still the enabler; therapy is what the long-term business model is really built on.
Todd Harrison – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue: All right. Thanks.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for his final remarks.
Kieran T. Gallahue: Thanks, Eric, and thank you all for joining us, as always. And also, as always, I want to thank our employees all over the globe and in our various functions for what was clearly their stellar efforts that drove ResMed’s performances last quarter and, in fact, over the course of our history. So, I want to say thank you to all those employees and I can tell you that we’re all very excited about our future here. We’ve got high-margin, exciting new products growing out over the course of the next year. We’ve got new policies that have been approved for the use of home sleep testing, new national accounts contracts to implement. We’ve got a very, very strong balance sheet with excellent cash flow and once again, we have an absolutely stellar team to continue on the execution. So, a lot of good things going on in the company and the industry. I want to thank you all for joining us and we look forward to updating you on future calls. Thanks everybody.
Operator: And thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2009 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jerry and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website, at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, you may go ahead, sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Cherrie, and welcome everybody to ResMed's Q1 conference call. As in the past, we're going to begin with an overview of the business and the quarter, and then I'm going to hand the ball over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide details of the financial results, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. So for those of you that have seen the press release, you can see that Q1 was once again a record quarter for ResMed. We are very pleased with our progress across the globe as the ResMed team continues to execute quite well. As always, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our team members from around the globe from the various functions for their efforts, their contributions, and most importantly, for the results. So let's get into the quarter. Well, global revenues grew at a robust 17% in the first quarter of 2009, and this growth was again very balanced across geographies. Americas revenue growth accelerated to 16%, up sequentially from 14% in Q4, and RoW did one better with an 18% growth rate in Q1 '09. We also saw balanced growth across product categories, with both the global flow generator and mask segments growing at 17% each during the quarter. Flow generator growth was bolstered by a full quarter of our S8II CPAP line that we launched in Q4 and which is evidenced by the US flow generator line, which is up 14% in Q1, up from 8% growth in Q4. So we continue to make progress in that area. Our new Easy-Breathe technology continues to set a new standard in the industry. It's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors and it really is a quantum leap in improved noise level and in comfort for patients. It's notable to mention that the fastest growing segment in the US flow generator business in percentage terms is our AutoSet product category. ResMed continues to be the leader in APAP technology and we've invested heavily in R&D over the years, and we continue to do so. During Q1, we also began launching our new VPAP line, which is now in the smaller S8 box. This brings the Easy-Breathe technology into our bilevel product line, so we're excited about the potential upside moving into Q2 and beyond, because this is our first new series of bilevels in five years. So a huge upgrade for the product line, one that I can tell you the sales force is incredibly excited about. The mask segment posted another double-digit quarter globally due to new product introductions led by the smaller low-noise nasal pillows mask, the Swift LT. We also recently launched the first mask product specifically designed by women and for women, called the Swift LT for Her. We expect this new addition to the Swift product line will provide a comfortable and quiet solution for our female patients, as this is the first and only gender-specific mask product on the market. Now, the question is why did we do it? We did it because women now represent 30% to 50% of newly diagnosed patients going into certain labs. So it is an important segment that is becoming increasingly important and gives us the opportunity to design new products and marketing categories around that vastly growing market. Additionally, gross margins stabilized in Q1, even in the face of growing Americas sales and a significant uptick in flow generator sales. We remain confident that we'll be able to improve margins as we progress in fiscal year '09. I'd also like to point out that we generated a record amount of cash this quarter, with $67.9 million in operating cash flow. That means in the past two quarters we've generated approximately $125 million in operating cash flow. This demonstrates our commitment to strong operating performance and a commitment to working capital control. During these recent times of global economic uncertainty, our deliberate focus on building a strong balance sheet with exceptional liquidity has proved to be a successful and an appropriate strategy. We continue to repurchase stock during Q1 with $24.1 million in share buybacks during the quarter. And as of September 30, 2008, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares in an authorized $8 million share buyback program. On the market development front, there's been an astounding three months or so of validation of the critical role that SDB plays in very serious comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. We are pleased to see the newly revised cardiovascular disease guidelines in Europe now include a formal recommendation for the use of CPAP therapy in symptomatic heart failure patients. What I'm referring to, of course, is the recent released European Society of Cardiologists' guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic and acute heart failure. This is the first time ever these influential guidelines have referred to the importance of identifying and treating sleep disorder breathing in heart failure patients. This follows the International Diabetes Federation consensus statement on sleep apnea published in June, where global experts, after carefully reviewing the clinical literature, concluded that Type II diabetes should be evaluated to determine if SDB is present, and then it went on to confirm that CPAP treatment is a gold standard therapy. So to summarize, influential global bodies have confirmed what we've long believed and have long been communicating, that it's critical to identify and treat sleep disorder breathing in patients suffering from two of the most costly and chronic disease states on the planet, diabetes and heart failure. So in summary, this was another great quarter, another record quarter for ResMed and the industry. We're confident about our ability to grow the market in 2009 and beyond. We have a strong business model, a very strong balance sheet, with substantial cash and little debt, and we look forward to growing shareholder value in fiscal year '09. All right. Now over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the P&L and the quarterly results. Brett?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Great. Thanks, Kieran. I'll briefly run through our September quarter results. As Kieran noted, revenue for the September quarter was $217.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $5.8 million to our Q1 revenues. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. Our income from operations was $36.6 million for the quarter, and net income for the quarter was $28 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.3%, consistent with Q4 FY'08, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix changes and foreign currency movements, offset by manufacturing improvements. The geographic mix impact was attributable to the acceleration of sales growth in US this quarter, while the strength in previous quarters of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar negatively impacted our gross margin. However, going forward, the recent and significant decline in the Australian dollar will be positive for our gross margin. I would expect this impact to be evident in the second half of fiscal '09, particularly in Q4, as inventory we are currently manufacturing is ultimately sold. We also continue to progress our margin expansion initiatives in areas such as supply chain, manufacturing and product development. SG&A for the quarter was $71.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by a more modest 10% over the prior year quarter. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved slightly to 33% compared to the year ago figure of 34%. R&D expense for the quarter was $17.3 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, R&D increased by 29%. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 8% this quarter compared to the prior year September quarter of 7%. And looking forward, and subject of course to currency movements, we would expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for the balance of fiscal year 2009. The lower R&D spend as a percentage of revenue really reflects the depreciation in the Australian dollar against the US dollar, which happened recently, as the majority of our R&D spend is denominated in Australian dollars. I think it is important to note that we will continue to invest in product innovation throughout the economic cycle. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.9 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.6 million. Now, before I move on to the revenue breakdowns, I would like to discuss FX currency impacts on our financial results, particularly given the unprecedented movements and volatility we are currently experiencing in these FX markets. Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball in the area. However, assuming today's exchange rates are maintained, the net is we expect positive impact on our bottom-line in FY'09. However, on our revenue line, and again, based on today's exchange rates, we expect year-on-year currency headwinds in the range of $10 million to $15 million per quarter over the next two quarters. Conversely, while we will be negatively impacted on our top-line, we'll actually benefit at the net income line due to the contribution of lower costs associated with the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the euro relative to the US dollar. So over the next few quarters, we expect the net currency benefit, again assuming today's exchange rates, will equate to approximately $0.02 per quarter positive impact on our EPS. Furthermore, in Q4, we expect the positive impact to be north of $0.02, as inventory currently being manufactured in Australia is ultimately sold to customers and released to our P&L. Turning now to revenues in a little more detail, overall Americas sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside of the Americas totaled $104.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenues between the product segments, in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 14% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 19%. The growth rates reflect the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions, particularly the S8 flow generator range and the Swift LT nasal pillows mask. For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 20% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 15%, again driven by strong sales across all our key international geographic markets. On a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 17%, while masks and other also increased by 17%. Cash flow from operations was a record $67.9 million for the quarter, and it does reflect strong underlying earnings and an improvement in working capital management, and something we've been working fairly hard on for the last 12 months or so. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34.5 million, and this included $21.9 million in building construction costs, predominantly associated with construction of our new headquarters in San Diego. We expect to incur a further construction cost of approximately $43 million over the balance of FY'09 in relation to this building. The expectation is we'll be completed towards the end of this fiscal year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $14.3 million. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 653,000 shares for consideration of $24.1 million. Again, as of today, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares out of a total approved buyback of 8 million. ResMed ended the first quarter of FY'09 in excellent financial shape. Our balance sheet remains very strong and is conservatively geared. At September 30, total assets stood at $1.3 billion and net equity was almost $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents, net of our external debt, totaled $157 million. I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right, great. Thanks, Brett. Well, why don't we… Cherrie, if we can open up the call to questions please. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Hi, guys. Congratulations.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Yeah. Just a question about the current economic environment, how sensitive do you think the sleep industry is to a weakening economy?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We haven't seen any impact, certainly no material impact out of changes within the economy. When we talk to our customers… obviously, they don't have a crystal ball, we don't have a crystal ball, but when we talk to them, they say that there is no material impact on them. So I think we're probably lucky here that we're in a category that there is a significant benefit that's brought to the patient for the symptomatic relief and where it's an important part of their life.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And then, just a quick update on Apria, if you can let us know how things are progressing on that front.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. As always, I can't go into too much detail on any given customer. But I'll you, the relationship remains strong, it gets closer every day. Like many of our customers, we do everything we can to help them serve the patients and help them grow the marketplace and that holds us in good stead over time. So that relationship is developing very nicely.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: All right, great. Thanks a lot.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Great. Maybe a quick question first for Brett. Did I hear you say that the $10 million to $15 million FX benefit would occur over the next two quarters or few quarters?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Ben, on the revenue we'll have a headwind, so it will reduce our revenues between $10 million and $15 million over the next few quarters. So you're talking over Q2 and Q3.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: But, I mean the movements in the currency really occurred in the euro kind of September for the most part. And when we look at it, you don't get back to normalization for a full year. Is there something --
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Correct. Yeah, there will be further headwinds in quarters going out as well until you anniversary, so to speak. But given the currencies are moving around hugely at the moment, I didn't think it was worth going further than that. But obviously, as you move out, if they stay the same, then you'd get… that $10 million to $15 million would grow. It would be higher in later quarters.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. It actually becomes bigger in the third and fourth quarter, primarily the fourth quarter out?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Correct. Provided exchange rates stay exactly where they are.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Yeah, I mean, that's --
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, correct.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: -- figure out where they are going to be in six months.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: That's right.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: But, again, Ben, you got the bottom-line impact, and I think that's what we're all looking at here. The bottom-line impact is these currency exchange rates that we've seen are a net positive for us. Obviously, we can't control it, but we're pretty damn pleased by what we've seen happen here recently.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: I mean just to get an example, Brett, I think to put a fine point on it, in Aussie dollar terms, if you spent whatever it was on R&D this quarter, $16 million, if we were out and that same number was going to happen in the March quarter, wouldn't that be more like $12 million or $13 million?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I mean you guys you've seen the currency. If you look at the Aussie down from its highs, you should remember that the highs actually occurred in July of Q1. So we were actually in that quarter. It's probably down around 30% off its highs at the moment. So you can see that that will be a substantial benefit on the cost side for us. And if you roll that through and you roll through the headwind we have on the revenue and margins and so on, you will get a positive benefit on the bottom-line, and around that sort of $0.02 range. And as we move through Q4, we'll certainly be north of that. The top-line reduces, but the bottom line actually increases, because our cost base is substantially lower in US dollars.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. So my follow-up, I guess, I'll limit it like we should, but on the gross margin side, the cost of sales, how big a chunk of that, if you can tell us with any granularity, is coming from Aussie-denominated costs versus more global, maybe hedged cost?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. The manufacturing, the majority of that is done down here in Sydney. So when you think about it, all the labor and overhead is obviously in Australian dollars, and some of the material. Obviously on the material front, we like to naturally hedge where we can. So we'll look to purchase in US dollars where we can. But a significant portion of the cost is Australian dollar-denominated. And that's why we're saying, as you move forward, and if that Aussie dollar is maintained where it is, we will get a significant improvement on our gross margin, because those costs will be so much lower. We don't feel that immediately because the inventory you make today you won't sell through the cycle for four or five months. So, therefore, you don't pick that benefit up until you finally release it in your P&L.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. Thank you. I will jump back in the queue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Jason? He is quiet today. All right. Why don't we move to the next one, Cherrie? Hello? Cherrie, are you still there?
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a little bit, perhaps, on the operating expense side. Kieran, as you look into your… head into year, how do you feel with respect to the size of the sales force right now? You guys obviously have had a bunch of new products out here. You have the Swift LT for women coming out. Do you feel like you are comfortable with the size of the sales force, or do you want to go ahead and add a few more heads in the coming year?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, good question. Our focus is always on two areas, right? One is on market expansion, and that's one of our primary goals, the continuing growth of this market, and the second one is the capturing of market share. And the sales force actually gets involved… in fact, the whole commercial organization gets involved in both of those categories. And we continually look at the balance of our reps and the balance of other commercial assets to determine how we can make the biggest impact, both on market growth or market expansion, as well as market share. I can tell you the way that we're designed now, we're in pretty good shape. As our sales grow, you do tend to expand the organization on a variable basis, which is natural. You split territories and you look to expand it. We've got some great opportunities on the new market development side that give us the opportunity to look at growth into diabetes and making more people aware of the role that diabetes plays or SDB plays in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. So we're not looking at some massive expansion at this point, but doing what we always do, which is incrementally adding as we see opportunity to go grow either the market or grow our share.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks for that. Then in terms of your feedback from your customers right now, are they generally indicating in terms of their order patterns as they look ahead, given the fact that they will be facing some reimbursement cuts, for instance on the Medicare side and so forth. Are you seeing any particular change in order patterns among the DMEs in anticipation potentially of a slower economy in calendar 2009?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, we're really not. But most of our customers don't carry much inventory from a days perspective. Their business model is not one that's built around significant inventory. So, no, we're not seeing any significant changes in that and I don't really anticipate any change in that.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks for that and I'll jump back in queue.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Great, Paul.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter here. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question relates to the market growth and volumes in general. It seems like just you guys are in a new product cycle. Volumes in the market from the checks we've done seem to be pretty healthy. It seems like on a constant currency, you were 14%. Can you just kind of talk to us? I know you obviously have headwinds with foreign exchange, so the way we should think about revenues definitely should keep that in mind. But in terms of just the volume side, can you just kind of talk about what you're seeing out there? And then, I guess sort of as a second part of that question, not to be too long-winded here, but the flow generation in the Americas grew 14%. That's a significant jump. It's been out for a full quarter. Can you kind of help us understand kind of what inning we are in this new product cycle, if we should see that kind of accelerate type of thing?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. But that counts as your follow-up question. That's sort of two.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Fair enough.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, no. Let me go after the first one first, the volume in the market. We've been saying the last couple of quarters that the market seems to be growing about 15%, where we see it may be a couple points below that on the revenue and a couple points above that on the volume and that seems to be maintaining itself. We're seeing good, solid, consistent growth. As we look forward with everything from home sleep testing to the IDF statement coming out to the guidelines on heart failure, we've got these great signals for the continued expansion of this marketplace because it is relevant in multiple medical silos and in the most costly comorbidities that exist and that are plaguing this planet. So, we're extremely well positioned and I think that's rolling through the results and it's rolling through the volume that we are seeing in the marketplace. As far us specifically, with the flow generator growth, yeah, you bet, we were very pleased to see that quarter-to-quarter we jumped from 8% growth in the United States right up to 14% growth in the United States. And that was really on the back of the CPAP range of flow generators, right, because that's what we had out for the full quarter. The S8II AutoSet and the Elite and Escape II. The bilevels, which we introduced in the Americas… two of the three of them we introduced in the Americas towards the backend of the quarter, one of them in the Americas we just released this quarter, Medtrade, and in Europe, we only released the bilevels at the ERS Show in October. So we've got these great bilevel products that will be coming through the pipeline here and impacting results, and it's a good margin product and one that still uses that Easy-Breathe technology and is just incredible. I mean, up to 90% quieter than the alternatives, better response rate, better performance. And we are seeing that in the results. It's just very, very good product and very good execution at the commercial level.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great. That's really helpful. And then, just a follow-up. I know everyone is talking about this or asking about it, so I don't mean to ask it in a third way here. But I guess just on the FX on the bottom-line, obviously, very, very good here, helps your bottom-line. Just in terms of the gross margin, and obviously, R&D and the SG&A, I think, Brett, you gave us a good way to think about R&D for the rest of the year. But as we model out, just how should we sort of account for that benefit, more on the gross margin, more on the SG&A side, or sort of split it down the middle?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I mean those costs or the Australian dollar cost, the euro cost benefit throughout SG&A, R&D and our COGS line, obviously. Think about it from an SG&A perspective, we're likely to see an improvement in that ratio. We're at 33% to revenue. My view is that that will improve because it reflects the lower cost base that we'll have. And on the margin front or the COGS front, again, I want to stress that you don't see that impact immediately, but it will flow through and It flows through as you ultimately sell the inventory. So I think through Q4 you will see the full impact of that. And it will be a significant impact, and there is no reason why that shouldn't have an impact on the margin expansion of the margin as that rolls through. But at the moment, that's not immediate. That will take a little bit of time to roll through.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: I guess because between your new products, obviously, benefiting hopefully stronger in the US, especially on the flow generator side, with the bilevels coming through, et cetera, is it sort of fair to think of the savings coming on the SG&A line right now because of the mix? And then, as we go through the end of the year, we see the gross margin tick up more as well as benefit from the SG&A?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Correct. You'll get SG&A now in the more immediate because they are translation-type impacts. And then, the margin will come through later on. That way, that's a reasonable way to look at it.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great. Thanks for the clarification. Congrats again, guys. Great work.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thanks.
Operator: And you next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Hi, guys. Can you hear me this time?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I feel like it's a telephone commercial here. Yes, we can hear you.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: It's a good commercial this quarter. Thanks. So the question I have is about this $0.02 upside. It would seem to me that folks are going to focus on this. I think what you saw right after you reported your quarter is some confusion as you reported $0.36, but we all report to First Call $0.38. So I'm probably telling you stuff you already know, but I want to clarify, at least, for my own erudition here so that we all are on the same page. The $0.02 upside per quarter that you presume may come from foreign currency, could you talk about how that relates to baseline? A $0.02 upside to what? And perhaps, you could answer that with respect to how you've guided long-term for the business. Kieran, you've talked about sort of mid teens type revenue growth, mid to high teens type earnings growth. Do those sort of percentages apply? While you don't give guidance, do those apply? And then, from that we are to expect perhaps the penny or two upside?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Kieran, do you want to answer that?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Let me just answer the market growth piece and then you can get into the financial piece, Brett.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, on the growth piece, you had mentioned mid to long-term looking at mid teens growth. I do want to highlight to you, the question was about market growth, right? What the market growth was going to be. We see it around 15%, a little bit lower on revenue and a little bit higher on volume. Our goal has always been and our history has always been that we've been able to outgrow the marketplace. As we look forward, and we look at these other market drivers, if you are talking about certainly the timeframes you are talking about or mentioned, we continue to believe that this market will grow robustly and we continue to believe that we have the ability to outgrow that marketplace. So I just want to be clear about that that those are two different questions. But anyway --
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Fair enough.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Brett, do you want to answer the EPS question?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, great. So, Jason, what I've done is tried to simplify down what their net impact is going to be and what our view is really of the base rate or currency there… is our average rates for this very quarter, for Q1. So if you look at that, it was around the 150 mark for the euro and around $0.88 for the Aussie. So they're still quite high. I mean, clearly, it's unprecedented that you would get that sort of decline in exchange rates in any ordinary time. So I think the way we've done it, the way we've hedged with purely option structures and so on means we have not taken out forward. So we can really only lose what we put in, in terms of premium or mark-to-market. So its put us in good stead to really participate in these lower exchange levels. And you'll see that come through on the bottom-line. My estimates are around $0.02 per quarter for the next few and going north of that in Q4.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Great. So, let me come clear here, Kieran and Brett. I am trying to nail you down on guidance that you don't give. So, with all of that out on the table.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: At least we've got it out in the open now, Jason.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: With all that out on the table, so '05, '06 you're a low to mid-20s type grower. '07 and '08, we were sort of between mid-single digits and low-double digits. So you do have easier comps. You have a favorable currency tailwind to your earnings. New product cycle in the US. And you've talked about your business, the end market looking pretty good. So I know I am not going to get you to give us a number, but perhaps you could talk about growth rates, earnings growth rates. Kieran, you mentioned that that is the most important thing. So help us out so we can model this a bit better. And then we can make our… draw our conclusions about how currency could positively impact that level in our own models.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, look, I think, the guidance that we've provided over the long haul, which is that the Americas market tends to grow in that 15% to 20% range; that the ROW market tends to grow in the 10% to 15% range; than you sort of bucket that all in and you are in the mid-to-upper teens; and growth in the marketplace; and we tend to outgrow that. I continue to strongly believe in that. And we've tended to have earnings growing basically at the same rate. It varies quarter-to quarter, but basically at that same rate as revenues. And the reason for that is we do get leverage, but we also invest back in R&D and we invest back in market development. And in a market that is 85% to 90% untapped, we are going to continue to do that.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: There is an enormous amount of innovation to be brought to bear in the market. You saw what we invested in R&D this quarter. Why did we do it? Because we're accelerating certain product development projects that we see huge hope for. We are investing in a clinical study known as SERVE-HF, which is demonstrating the link between congestive heart failure and SDB, and when you treat that SDB the cardiovascular benefits that can occur. Those are very important markers, both for growing the marketplace as well as for establishing our position in that. And we absolutely plan to continue to invest.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Completely understand. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions here. You mentioned that the auto setting product set is the fastest growing in the States. Can you elaborate why you think that is? Does it have something to do with at-home testing?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You know, I think it's got… there's a number of different drivers to it, right? So, number one, our product remains the absolute best algorithm in the marketplace. It long has been. But last year, the Americas commercial team specifically focused on ways that they could demonstrate and communicate that to customers, all right? So not just studies, which are very important and very compelling, but also to get a little bit more visceral, a little more hands on and we developed tools and techniques, which allowed comparison of our products to competitive products, are allowed them to see how the technologies worked in reality. And they could pull the competitors' product off their shelf, pull ours off. So there is nothing staged about this. It's real world selling tools. And those selling tools have really helped communicate the benefit of the technology, which has existed. So, I think that is a big part of it. In addition, we do have some things going on in the marketplace that bode well for auto setting technology as well as data-rich products. So, for instance, home sleep testing has a lot of people very interested in the idea of how they can effectively use auto setting devices. The requirements that seem to be developing on monitoring compliance, which we think are great, right? Because anything that focuses on patient compliance means that people are going to stay true to the therapy. It means that they are going to go through that early hump that everybody goes through, and then once you get a person compliant, you have them for decades. It's great for the patient, it's great for the healthcare system and governments that are paying for this, and it's great for our business over the long haul. And so the data-rich nature of our auto setting device allows the HME to help troubleshoot patient compliance and help figure out how they can improve that patient compliance. So I think there's multiple reasons for that stem from execution on the fundamental back of a great product. And I should mention, of course, the S8II motor is in there now, I mean the Easy-Breathe motor technology. I shouldn't forget that. I mean this is a hugely, hugely beneficial piece of technology that significantly reduces noise, continues on our high quality platform that's always driven ResMed, and allows that system to be even more responsive to patient needs. So we're just executing on a number of different fronts very well. The team is doing a great job.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: So with home sleep testing, the view is still that's maybe 12 months away from having any meaningful impact?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: The starting gun has really gone off with home sleep testing. I mean it's… you've now got a number of private payers, that they are involved in. In fact, in just a minute, I will pass it over to Dave and he can talk a little bit more about this, Dave Pendarvis. But, we have long said, in fact, ever before home sleep testing was ever approved, we said, when this thing comes through there's going to be a time period of adoption where the things that are going to trigger us and say, this is going well are private insurers jumping on board with it over time. And it's also going to be pilots, that are going to be launched, that allow for different models of how to implement home testing to come through. And I'd tell you, you look a year ago to today, if you told me a year ago that the number of private payers would have jumped on board and the government was going to say the starting gun has gone off on home sleep testing, we'd have said… this is fantastic. And we do believe it's fantastic. It's moving very well. At Medtrade, we saw a number of both sleep physicians and HMEs, who were telling us about new models of home sleep testing that they are piloting. So this is beginning to happen. And so, we remain very bullish about the expectation. Dave, do you have anything to add on that?
David Pendarvis - Senior Vice President of Organizational Development and General Counsel: Just a little bit Kieran and Alex, I think what Kieran said was absolutely correct, that if you look at the progress we've made so far, we are very encouraged by it. We think more progress will continue to be made. CIGNA and United, two large private health insurers, have authorized home testing under their policies. The federal government under the CMS guidelines authorized home testing. And also, you are starting to see now, beginning in November 1 just a few days ago, the new compliance standards, which are not directly related to home testing but came out at about the same time, being put into place. We think any emphasis on compliance is going to be good for us. As you indicated earlier, it would help drive sales of the AutoSet device and other data-rich devices. So, we think it's going to be slow and steady and inexorable progress with regards to home sleep testing and the emphasis on compliance.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Thanks. Final question, if I may, probably for Brett, about the working capital improvements that have gone to help operating cash flows. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what those working capital improvements have been? And can we expect more of them?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, on the working capital, Alex, I mean the big one has really been driving down the inventory and improving our inventory turnover, over, probably trended down over the last six months or so. That's been a big benefit to us. And we were a little distracted somewhat previously with the recall, as well and purchasing for that, and the building of those units and so on. That's all behind us now. We can focus back on really getting that down to an efficient level of inventory holdings. So that has had a big impact. Receivables, we looked at around the group as well. We have just sat there and done a lot of the basics right and looked through there. Creditors, we've try to realign through supply accounts and so on. Just to realign days sales we have with suppliers, to more realign with what we get with our customers. Just a lot of those things that we're doing that hopefully we are getting right and we'll see that working capital improves. I mean, clearly, you cannot get your working capital to zero, so to speak, but is there improvement left? Yes, I believe we still have improvement that we can make there and I think we will. We have also put in software, for example, in part of our forecasting and planning. That, we think, has already shown a good early results. And I think that will improve our overall planning and forecasting, for example, in manufacturing. So, a lot of things that we're doing on multiple fronts that maybe not a silver bullet, but add them up and they really do have an impact. And we'll stay focused on that, particularly in the current environment. Obviously, you can't be lazy in those areas.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Thanks very much, guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Joanne Wuensch with BTO [ph] Capital Markets.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: I changed firms again, apparently. Thank you very much for taking my question. Joanne from BMO. A couple of housekeeping questions. The tax rate in the quarter was somewhat lower than we had expected. Could you give us an idea of what you think your full year tax rate may be?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Joanne, I think when I've looked at that and we've looked through what we're forecasting through the year and the geographic mix and so on. I think around that 28% mark is a reasonable estimate of the tax rate going forward. We've benefiting from R&D concessions, obviously, here in Australia. Also, continue to benefit, for example, Germany. It's a little while ago now, but reduced their corporate tax rates quite significantly. As you know, we have a sizable operation in Germany. So those factors have tended to bring that down a little over time. And around that 28% is, I think, a reasonable estimate going forward.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, that's helpful. What was your exit rate share count in the first quarter?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Exit rate? So just the closing rate of shares, or --
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Not the average rate for the quarter. What's your released exit rate?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, well, average dollar shares outstanding was $77.2 million.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Right, I'm asking the exit, not the average for the quarter.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: That at exit? Around a little lower than that, probably just under… a little under $77 million.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: All right. You guys have done a very good job of pushing, encouraging, researching sleep apnea and the comorbidities. At what stage do you think you might be in a position to start breaking out the contribution to revenue? Are you in a position to say that 5% of the revenue growth comes from comorbidities at this stage?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. There is such a mix in the way that the volume that gets driven out of these comorbidities exists that breaking it out would not really be a useful exercise. Remember, these are patients who have comorbidities. But what they're presenting, what we're treating in many cases is stop [ph] standard SDB, right? I mean it is the disorder. We treat it with the same products and the same technologies. The difference is where the referrals are coming from. Now there is a difference there on advanced heart failure, as an example, when we use products such as the ACS2, the adaptive servo-ventilation, which, by the way, since you brought it up, is an incredible technology. We had in addition to the SERVE-HF, there is a pilot study that we're doing, a smaller study up in the Nordics, where there is 10 patients. And this hasn't been published yet, but since I am not going to get specific on it, I can talk a little bit about it. 10 patients, which have gone on the device in the last… well, I guess it's about six months now, a little bit under six months. One of those was on a heart transplant list. That person was released from the heart transplant list. So we've got some phenomenal data coming out of the comorbidities. But it's not the type of data it would make sense for us to break out in results.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then, not to beat a dead horse on this FX impact, I want to think about this slightly differently. If you had operating margins of, call it, 21.2% in fiscal year '08, would you be surprised to see your operating margins up 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal year '09?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Brett, do you want to take that?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I mean, the problem is there's a lot of factors and a lot of movements and things that happen. But if you said if all things being equal and the currencies where they are, then you would expect an expansion on that.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Right. But I'm trying to ask without… I know you guys don't give guidance, without giving guidance. Back into what the impact is to the bottom-line and then we're expanding margins, and then you quantify it as $0.02. And to go back to Jason's questions, it is $0.02 on top of what? So I want to sort of peel away all that to sort of say, what does it mean for operating margins? And so, I am coming up when I plug in all my FX numbers, probably an expansion of about 100 basis points year-over-year. And I am just trying to see if that's in the ballpark of what you guys are coming up assuming FX rates stay the same way they are.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we don't want to specifically start down the guidance path, because we don't, as you guys say. But just look at it logically. If those currencies, there is improvement there, our cost base is reduced, and so on. Then you expect that there would be an improvement there.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, I tried. Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Hi.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Michael.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Let's see. I just got on from another call, so I apologize.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, wait. You mean you missed the whole intro?
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Yes, unfortunately. We've done one of our surveys here again, and we asked the question of the HMEs about this 9.5% reimbursement cut. And at a high percentage of them seems to think that that will spill over to the private pay in part of the market. Then I know that's a little bit different from kind of your perspective. I was just wondering if you could give me your thoughts on that. Maybe why do you think that their perception is that some of these private insurers may try to follow that?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well, you are going to get a lot of diversity in what people say. Certainly, we talk to substantial numbers of these HMEs on a daily basis, and there is always quite a bit of variability and everybody always ends up the conversation the same way, which is… none of us has a crystal ball. But I'll tell you, when I look at this I look at history, right? And that's the way we as an organization look at it. And if you go the last time the CMS went through a significant cut, which is about three years ago, right? With the oxygen and the Mednet cuts. And there was a lot of question at that time, a lot of handwringing. Is this going to be something that's going to be very difficult? Is it going to spread through all the product lines? Is this going to be a negative for us? And the reality of what happened is… these HMEs are businesses and they need to figure out how to be profitable, and they need to figure out how to grow. And many of them found sleep at that point. And maybe more importantly, they found that in order to grow their business, there was this great thing called trailing revenues or annuity businesses that was available to them if they followed up with their compliant patients or would be available to them as they increase compliance. So, as we look at these times of change, I see opportunity. This is an opportunity for us to demonstrate to HMEs, to show them how they can grow. We're getting much more receptive ears about how to approach the diabetes marketplace and the cardiovascular marketplace. We're getting very receptive ears about how to grow accessory programs. So I… when we look at these things, we see opportunity. We take it that way, and we're tending to have some very positive discussions with our customers.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Okay. I noticed that your accounts receivable were up by a couple, I guess, three days. I've heard some scuttlebutt out there about some strains in the HME community. Should we be concerned about that? Is there a risk that that could continue to go up and you could have to write-down some of your receivables or something at some point if the economy continues to be under pressure?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Look, we're feeling that our… the policies that we have with our customers are quite sound. We've got very good relationship with customers across the marketplace. We have a very broad group of customers, so we don't have a massive concentration in any given customer. We monitor our payments from our customers on a regular basis. If we think that something is causing us concern, then we have conversations with them. And if necessary, we modify our behaviors. But that's something that's part of our ongoing business. So at this point, we're not seeing anything that gives us any great concern at all.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And you may have already talked about this, but just an update on how you're doing within Apria. Have you made any progress in terms of picking up any market share there so far?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. It was asked earlier, but the answer to the question was, look, we were not going to go into a lot of detail on any customer relationship because we respect the privacy of those customers, and for obvious competitive reasons. What I will say is that that relationship, like the relationships we have with other large customers, are quite sound. We have a very energetic and capable sales team, both at the field level as well as the key account level. I'd say that the Americas commercial organization, overall, is executing incredibly well. Very crisply. And that translates into our relationship with our customers. So we're feeling very good about that relationship as well as the relationship we have with other major customers.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then on R&D, it was up some. Can we expect it to stay closer to 8% over the next few quarters?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so what we're saying is that you can expect it around the 7% level is around what we're expecting.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So we're going to continue to invest through the cycle. We've got some benefits on the foreign exchange side, given that a lot of that's denominated in Oz dollars, but we will continue to invest.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities: All right, that's all I've got. Thanks a lot.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. You bet, Michael.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Kieran, if I could get you to talk about rest of world sales, and particularly mask sales we saw come off on a sequential basis. Is there anything to speak of there, as to why that slipped? And perhaps, if I could get you to talk about the key markets outside the US as a general question.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, we… thank you for asking that. We do tend to spend a lot of time on the Americas and we've got an exceptional organization throughout the globe. And that deserve to be recognized for the accomplishments that they are making both in growing the market and for gaining market share. We are doing quite well, both in Europe and in the Asia Pac area. We've seen some very significant improvements in markets such as Germany. We've talked quite a few years about the transitions that we have been going through in Germany and some of the challenges of consolidation. And under the leadership of Lasse Beijer and Frank Rebbert, they've done an excellent job of a growing an organization, getting them commercially focused, putting in the tools and techniques that allow them to grow. Japan is doing very, very well for us across the board and across our partners there. Obviously, we have some markets that have some challenges. So there's always some ups and some downs. And the balance of that is that we're doing quite well in ROW and the team does feel good and should feel good about themselves. Specifically in mask, quarter-to-quarter you're going to get some variations in some of the line items. I wouldn't read too much into that. Summer months in Europe are always an odd time anyway, so I wouldn't read too much into that.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks very much. And just the other question, we've talked in the past a lot about pricing in the States, particularly. And my understanding is post Philips taking out Respironics, things have calmed down, but maybe just as a general question there, what are you seeing on the pricing front and the level of competitiveness on that front?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We're feeling good about the pricing environment now. There is always a bit of price pressure out there, but you compare it to where it was six month ago, nine months ago, we're I think in a very good position today. As you mentioned, Philips has been a good competitor to date. We haven't seen a lot of changes in their field organization or emphasis or focus at this point. And I remain hopeful that that organization will do as it has in other areas of medical technologies, which is invest in market expansion, invest in innovation, and not play the price game. Because I don't think that does anybody any good. And so far, everything we've seen has been consistent with that.
David Low - Deutsche Bank: All right, thanks very much.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Stanton with ABN AMRO. Please proceed.
David Stanton - ABN Amro: Thanks. Just to David's question previously, can you also talk about I guess pricing in Europe, with Philips in that market now? And also, I guess my follow-up is around the impact of home diagnosis. Are you seeing any declines in the number of beds that are being built in sleep centers in anticipation of home diagnosis growing? Thanks a lot.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, on the European front, we're not seeing the acquisition of Respironics by Philips really any significant changes in Europe at this point at all. So that organization seems to have… I don't know if it's been left alone, but certainly what we're seeing from a commercial perspective is quite a bit of status quo. And we're certainly comfortable with that. As far as the home sleep testing, yes, look, we're not seeing… we're not hearing from sleep labs that they are slowing down expansion. The funny thing is that as you've gone through this year, as more and more clarity has been brought to bear on home sleep testing, actually you see many members of the sleep community are gaining comfort and getting an understanding of how they can use home sleep testing, and how they can use PSG. Because PSGs aren't going away. We have long believed that the introduction of home sleep testing is actually going to drive greater volume of PSGs. Because as our Chairman has often said, it is moving us from fishing in a pond to fishing in the ocean, because we're able to access and treat and help more patients because of the simplification of the diagnostic process as well as the expansion of capacity when you aggregate both the PSGs and the home sleep tests. So we're not hearing… in fact, last week at Medtrade, I was hearing of a number of labs that were talking about expansion, in fact, were in the process of expansion. So I was quite encouraged to hear that, actually.
David Stanton - ABN Amro: Thanks a lot.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Helen Cameron with Citi. Please proceed.
Helen Cameron - Citigroup: Thank you. Just a brief question on depreciation. It's dropped $2 million in this quarter after being higher for the previous two. Just wondering whether annualized we're looking at a lower depreciation figure there of around $8 million.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the depreciation and amortization for the quarter, Helen, is down a little bit. It's around that $14.3 million mark. Currencies where they are, around that number, perhaps slightly less would be probably in the ballpark.
Helen Cameron - Citigroup: So annualized, probably around $8 million lower.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, if you look… yes, around that figure.
Helen Cameron - Citigroup: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for his final remarks. Please proceed, sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. As always, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our employees throughout the globe in the various functions. That is what drives ResMed, and it's a fabulous team and one that we are very proud of here. I can tell also that, as you can hear from the call today, it was another great quarter, another record quarter for us in many different ways. We've seen some fabulous opportunities for market expansion in both the cardiovascular space and diabetes as well as through further improvement and adoption of the home sleep testing. We've got great high margin new products rolling out in the masks and the bilevels. We've got new national account wins that we're implementing. Just a lot of good things going on, and we're very excited about the year as we move forward. So, thank you again for your interest. We appreciate it and we look forward to updating you as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day. .

===== 2008 Q4  (2008-08-06 16:30:00) =====

Analysts: Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams David Clair - Piper Jaffray Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2008 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marsha, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as, projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new market for the company products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Marsha. Well welcome everybody to ResMed's Q4 2008 results call. I am very pleased, very optimistic about our performance and about the recent industry developments. And I look forward to reviewing those with you today. So we set new records for performance and results during the quarter and I will open the call up by making some introductory comments, then I'm going to turn the call over Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer to go through the financials in a bit more detail. And then it will come back to me for... me and the team actually for your questions. Well we finished 2008 on a high note. Global revenue was 23% in the fourth quarter coming in at a record $235 million. As we continue our focus strategy of launching new and innovative technologies into the global marketplace. In particular I was very pleased to note that the growth was stimulated by regions across the globe. Every region for ResMed played a critical role and contributed to our success. It's also important to mention that the company generated a record $56.8 million in operating cash flow during the current year... quarter. And that was driven by solid working capital management and operating performance. And we put those funds to good used by repurchasing almost $52 million of company's stock during the fourth quarter. The outside U.S. business continues to fire on all cylinders posting a 32% growth in revenue. France and Germany were the main drivers in Europe and we expect to see continued success on the leadership of Lasse Beijer and his team in fiscal year '09. We're also very pleased to see the American's region return to mid-teens growth with a 14% increase in revenue year-over-year. We launched the number of new products in Americas in Q4 and a feedback on those products has been absolutely phenomenal. The flow generator segments grew 17% worldwide and we're pleased to see how the U.S. flow generators segment return to growth in the high single-digits due to the introduction of the S8 II platform with our innovative Easy-Breathe technology. In particularly the high-end or auto in the lead products performed exceptionally well with AutoSet leading the way as the fastest growing flow generator in category from a percentage terms. NASS segment, posted another banner quarter with 29% global growth, due to new product introductions led by the new smaller low noise nasal pillows products with Swift LT. This product has been received exceptionally well in the marketplace. We believe the new products have much more to run and we're confidence that continued innovation in NASS Technologies will bring additional growth as we launched several new products in fiscal year '09. For the year ended June 30, the company grew revenues 17% to $835.4 million while generating a record $143 million in operating income and $110.3 million in net income. We ended the year with an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We had $321 million in cash and we demonstrated our confidence in this industry and in our company by repurchasing $2.6 million shares this fiscal year, representing a total investment at share repurchase of nearly $100 million. As we entered at fiscal '09 I think it's useful to step back and reflect a bit on the industries prospects for growth. In summary, this industry has never been poised more for expansion of a growth. We need only to look the developments within the past few months to demonstrate that this under penetrated market remains robust and remains one of the most attractive segments in the medical device industry. For example, home testing; it's been early encouraging signals related to home sleep testing. Approvals from private insurers like Anthem the largest insurer the U.S. will help open up the diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing to many more patients. I personally believe that as we look back on home sleep testing, we'll look at this as a single biggest inflexion point in this industry's future. Competitive bidding was delayed for 12 to 18 months providing some certainty to the HME's so they can plan their expansion strategies. We formed to join marketing agreement with Johnson & Johnson LifeScan Division, the largest provider of glucose meters in the Americas to promote awareness and education of sleep disorder breathing in the diabetic population. New clinical literature and medical guidelines including the International Diabetes Federation statement on sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes were released. And a review article in the ACC, AHA on sleep disorder breathing and cardiovascular disease which was published in circulation and jacked just a few weeks ago. In fact just last week, MSMBC picked up an update from Dr. Terry Young's latest data, which showed a six-fold increase in the risk of death for severe sleep disorder breathing patients. We are clearly serving a population of patient that need our help and that are costing the healthcare systems around the globe billions of dollars. And we are doing it with a therapy that is incredibly safe. Safer than an Aspirin and yet is in incredibly efficacious. In summary, we just completed a record breaking quarter for ResMed. We experienced growth throughout the globe. We rebounded in the Americas, we have a series of new products that are either in the launch process or soon to be there. We generated a record breaking $56.8 million in cash during the quarter and we are confident about our ability to grow the market in the short and the long-term and about out opportunity to grow shareholder value throughout fiscal year '09. Now over to Brett and then back to your questions. Brett?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Kieran. I'll briefly run through the June quarter results. Our revenues for June quarter was a record $235.2 million, a 23% increase over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $14.1 million to our Q4 revenues. Our income from operations of $37 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $29.6 million. During the quarter we recognized an additional charge of $3.1 million for asset recall, staying at throughout of our original accrual and reflecting more thoroughly on actual cost incurred as we approach the conclusion of the recall. We do not anticipate any meaningful incremental expenses associated with recall in fiscal year 2009. Excluding recall expenses and amortization requiring tangibles our income from operations was $42.2 million and net income for the quarter was $33.2 million. While diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42, an increase of 14% over to prior year comparable quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 58.3%, down sequentially from Q3 reflecting product mix changes, foreign currency movements and ISP declines. The product mix impact was attributable to the strong recovery in flow generated sales in the U.S. this quarter. While the strength of Australian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our gross margins. However, I would note that recently the Australian dollar has declined from its high than any sustained decline in the Ausi dollar will be positive for the gross margins. Additionally and importantly, we expect initiatives currently in progress in areas such as supply chain, manufacturing and product development to have a positive impact on margins as we look forward. SG&A for the quarter was $77.4 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by more modest 10% over the prior year quarter. SG&A substantial revenue improved to 33%, compared for a year ago figure of 34%. R&D expense for the quarter was $17.6 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter and again in constant currency terms R&D increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the year ago figure. With our ongoing commitment to innovation, solid product pipeline and clinical trial activity, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continuing in the 7% range for the fiscal year 2009. Amortization of the acquired intangibles was $2.1 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.3 million. Turning to revenues in more detail. Overall Americas sales were $112.2 million, an increase of 14% over the prior quarter. So, outside Americas probably $123 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenues between product segments. In the Americas, flow generators increased by 8% over the prior year quarter, well Masks and other increased by 18%. The growth reflects the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions, including encoring traction from recently introduce, S8 II flow generator. For revenues outside the U.S., flow generators increased by 24% while Masks and other increased by 49%. Again driven by strong new product sales across key international geographic markets. On a group basis flow generator sales increased by 17% while Masks and other increased by 29%. Cash flow from operations as Kieran had mentioned was a record $56.8 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.2 million and these included $7.8 million in building construction cost, predominantly associated with the constructions of our new headquarters in San Diego. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $16.5 million. We continued to buyback shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.4 million shares for consideration of $61.7 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. For fiscal year 2008, we have repurchased $2.6 million shares or approximately 3% of shares outstanding. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares out of the total approved buyback of 8 million shares. We ended the fiscal year financial in very good shape. Our balance sheet remains strong, with total asset of $1.4 billion and net equity $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of external debt were $183 million at the end of June. I'll now hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Brett. Well with that why don't we open up the line for some questions? Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall [UBS Securities]. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Good morning guys. Thanks very much and very good results. Perhaps if I can just ask a couple of housekeeping questions, just I guess on FX, total FX impacting perhaps just give a sense of what plan through from you're the stronger account you got there but also in terms of cost as well?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Yes thanks for the question Andrew. And Brett you want to take the FX, please?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Andrew if you looking at that on total net basis including some of the foreign currency hedging gains we've made this quarter which around $1.2 million, you probably... if you look through on EPS its $0.01 to $0.02 actually positive impact year-on-year from currencies.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: And perhaps could you sell through... I just presumably the euro was obviously contributing quite strongly top-line?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Correct. So the euro... they're troubling on their revenues obviously there was $14 million or touch over and the euro has contributed obviously offset largely by the increase or appreciation the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Okay. And you're saying that net is about 1.2?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, $0.01 to $0.02, including the hedging gains for this quarter.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Okay good. And perhaps just drilling down to the performance just perhaps if you could... maybe just expand here a little bit more on, what's the contribution in new products has been and perhaps maybe Kieran if you could just give on what driving and have a result or the having surcharge this quarter?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, absolutely. It was a great product or I should a great quarter for wins across the board from new products to new customers vendors or penetration within current accounts. So, during the third quarter we had launched the VPAP Auto and the Mirage Micro. So we have full quarter in the fourth quarter. And then during this past quarter we launched the S8 II Auto and the S8 II Elite, part of the way through the quarter in the U.S and then very late in the quarter we launched the S8 II Escape. And then of course in the math side the Swift LT. The products have been received exceptional well. I guess, tell you this Easy-Breathe Technology that is the under pinning of the new VPAP products as well as the S8 II series. And importantly, just remind ourselves, this Easy-Breathe Technology is a motor technology where it's a double ended blower. It's incredibly efficient, it allows for massive sound reduction. I mean some of the new buy levels we're going to launching are 90% quieter than the competitive alternative. And yet they are more responsive than any other motor on the marketplace. So what you have is, benefit from noise allowing you to reduce the size of the instruments. But also improved performance, all of which yield benefits on the compliance side and that that's where we're trying to drive compliance, because flow generators lead to complaint patients, which means they use more Masks which there would be the highest profitability segment we have overtime. So it's a very sort of good trend that we see from that perspective. So as far as this quarter, the S8 II Elite and Auto contributed well. We saw particularly in the AutoSet side of the business in the Americas that whether it's a consequence of home sleep testing or other develops in the market, we just saw a very, very significant up-tick on those types of products. We really haven't seen the impact yet of the Escape too, that would probably come in this year or I should say this quarter.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Because it was launched late in the quarter. And the Swift LT came out like a shot. I mean it is a really differentiated product, smaller, it's quieter. We've got part of a quarter impact on that, probably about two thirds of the quarter. So... and we're looking forward to that rolling out through the rest of the part of year. So from a product perspective, what we've launched has been received very well in the marketplace. And by the way we've got a couple of new products that are launching as I speak in the bilevel category. And we've got some new Mask in the pipeline throughout this year. So very good from a product perspective. From a customer perspective, we've continued on wins. We made progress at the large accounts, obviously, I am not going drill too much in the detail on any given customer in respect for their privacy. But we have done well with some of these new competitive wins and I... we quite frankly haven't gotten all that I expect to get from it. So we're still in the early cycle, I'd say on some of these competitive wins and gaining share and I expect continue to do so throughout the year.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Okay. Perhaps we out missing the line, any particular customers move that material... was it material to this result?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: One of us is being breaking. So I couldn't really understand you. Could you say that Andrew?
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: I am sorry. Sorry, was it Aprea material to this result?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So Aprea has always been a large account for us. And obviously, it's going to get, we believe it's gone get larger and it has been getting larger, given that we're now playing on a level playing field. I am not going to speak directly to the numbers other than to say there was increase that was due to them. But it was certainly not the majority of the increase that we experienced. We had experienced and wins across the board at multiple accounts and in the accounts that we're in because of the products that we released.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Okay. So that's probably fair to say that it will soon ramp up?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities: Yes, I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills. Please proceed.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Thanks, Kieran. Congrats on a good quarter.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: So, U.S. business bounced back perhaps a little bit better and sooner than we expected and perhaps you could comment to Andrew's question following on as to really how much impact we saw in the quarter from sort of unit growth in the U.S. relative to what pricing did? And then I was curious, with respect to the gross margins, clearly we all sit in the room here when I talked investors as where gross margins are going to do, so I would like to understand better how currency impacted gross margins specifically? And what otherwise is a great quarter across the board. We saw gross margins come down a little bit and I feel like some of the really great things in the quarter could get lost unless we understand sort of where that could drop going forward and if in fact Kieran, we could start to see that with a little bit more of a stable currency tick back up sequentially here in the first quarter of fiscal 2009?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, great, great question Jason. Look, we had the results that you saw that come of out of the Americas, we were very pleased with we are very proud of that it came back very strongly. And the answer is across it was across the board. That was driven by new products, it was driven by execution, it was driven by new customer win. So, there were a number of factors that came into play, all of which were very important. But let me just see at the specifically the gross margin question. So yes, we did see a tick down to 58.3% and I think there is a number of things that you want to keep in mind with that. For those of you who've been following ResMed for number of years which you've seen is that we normally take a tick down in Q4, it's sort of a historical trend that we've normally experienced during the fourth quarter. And as you know, Americas came back strong, very strong. We jumped from up to 14% growth from where were at which is 5% in the prior quarter and our flow generators went to from negative 5% all the way up to plus 8% on the back of some fantastic product releases. And in addition to the currency, and the currency did absolutely play a role in it. We've long known the geographic mix in the U.S. and product mix the flow generators had some impact on the gross margin percent. I mean it's very good for cash flow, it's very good for gross margin dollars and it puts a little bit of pressure on the percentage, the gross margin percentage. But if I drill down that a little bit more, lets talk about what we're doing about margin expansion as we're moving forward. What are we doing from the fundamentals, not only for this continued growth that we've seen, but also to look at the margin line. And there is a couple of different things that we're engaged in right now that I think are going to start paying dividends. So let's go through them. One is the pricing, alright. So we feel the product pricing has stabilized. We made some adjustments over the past couple of quarters to get us back in line with market pricing and we now feel that we're price correctly for the market. Approx we have a seller year of product launch ahead of us. And importantly a number the products that we have that are on the launch cycle yield strong margins and that's not an accident. Several years ago, we substantially increased our R&D focus on products such as Masks and such as Bilevel and we're just now in the middle for instances of those Bilevel launches that I mentioned before the VPAP SC and VPAP Auto 25. Both of them use this Easy-Breathe technology, up there are 90% quieter and the competitive alternative, there are in the smaller box and they've got ResMed quality. We've got the Swift LT rollout which we only saw a partial quarter, last quarter, we're going to see a full quarter of this quarter and as we move forward. And I got to tell we've got a year that we're going to be rolling out additional Masks throughout the year. So between the Bilevel in the Mask, we've got a good product flow ahead of us. Alright? Supply chain, alright? So this is our third area that we're focused on. We are actively engaged in this for margin expansion in the supply chain leveraging the volume growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. As we grow volume we grow opportunity. And what we've done is we've gone outside the company, we've looked to... in fact we've gone outside the industry, we looked to the automotive industry and said, hey, how can we do things better? We've hired in some of that talent, we're actively engaged in it now and I fully expect that to be showing dividends. And finally manufacturers, now in addition to our very strong comfortable presence in Australia we're gone be adding capacity in a lower cost region. Where we can still maintain our high expectations for quality, we will not drop on quality sides. But we do see opportunities for augmenting our current manufacturing strategy with lower cost locations. Alright? And we expect to be doing that in the coming six months or so. So in summary, totally agree with you I think ForEx absolutely have some impact on it. We have natural sort of cycle in Q4 as well and we had very result in the Americas and as I look forward be it from the supply chain, be it from product introduction that we're in the mid to rolling out, be it a stabilization in market pricing to the manufacturing I see very good opportunities on the margin side as we look forward.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Thanks Kieran, that was very, very robust and very helpful it sound like you --
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Jason you're going to get me in trouble being provoked.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Well, it was quite good. Lets put it that way. And if you were obviously well prepared for that question expecting perhaps to receive a question about gross margins. So you maybe perhaps... hopefully you would answer this question which would be, could you give us some comfort that you... ResMed may show us sequentially up gross margins assuming we are at sort of the currency levels that we saw exceeding the quarter. Can you at least go that far as to say that this could be as we look two quarters back... two quarter ahead looking back the top in gross margins given all that you said about the improvement you expect to make in those four or five areas?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Jasonlook I would never get into that shorter term of discussion when it comes to the complexities of geographic mix and product mix and everything else. So we have always stayed away from very short term discussions on gross margins, I am not... continue to stay away from that, but I will reiterate that we feel very comfortable with the action plan ahead of us and we do feel very comfortable with everything from product introductions schedules to lay down through the market situation on pricing.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay so, but generally over this, over a longer period of time, you would be, you would expect to see gross margins at a higher levels sort over a longer period of time than where you exited 2008 fiscal year.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely, we are really [ph] targeted on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and last question, I'll get back in queue, as it relates to the Americas region, your flow generator sales certainly improved dramatically, but is lower than where I think market growth is did generally. Would you expect a launch... full launch of the escape here this quarter to have an impact on taking your flow generator sales sort of back in to that low to mid teens level like you showed for the total Americas business this quarter.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we're feeling very good, where we are in our product cycle, where the S8 2 has a very good contributor. Let's not forget outside the U.S. and the growth that we've seen over the last several quarters, not only from execution, but also because we launched product like the S8 II earlier outside the U.S. and we have seen same growth from that. I fully expect that that the Escape II will be receive well in the marketplace. It already has been received well in it's early days. I fully expect that the bilevels that we launching over the course of this quarter will be received well in the marketplace. So I think that we're in a good place in our product launch side.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much, Kieran great quarter.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line... one moment. Your next question comes from the line of David Clair. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We can, David.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, well first of all congratulations on a great quarter. Well, it's very impressive results. I just was wondering if you could may be discuss the pipeline that you had, it sounds like fiscal '09, it's going to be pretty good year from a product launch perspective, I mean. What should we be looking for and is it more kind of a back half '09 waiting or is it a kind study throughout the year.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We've got various products that are launching throughout the year. I'll talk specifically with the products we're midst of launching now. And for competitive reasons, I'll stay away specifics on some of the other products and very specific timing. But, we are, you think about this quarter, it looks to be the first quarter that we will have full Swift LT, full S7 Elite, full S8 Auto, full S8 II in the Americas. And we've got the bilevel side, we have the VPAP FT and the VPAP Auto 25, both are literally in the midst of launching as we speak now. So I think that product lineup is a very exciting product lineup from the flow generator side, as well as with the Swift LT. From the mass perspective, you can expect several mass that will come out at various times throughout the year. So it's not all loaded to one part of the year or the other. So I think it's a good mix bag right across the product line.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And, if we could just talk, you actually kind of hit this a little bit earlier but you said that you think that pricing has stabilized at this point, I mean what's kind of your estimate of price pressure in the quarter in North America, I mean is it still a low single-digits that we are looking at or if you could just talk about it real quick, that will be great.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: I think when you look at a lot of the genesis of some of the price movements, it really is about a year ago or so that may be, actually little bit more than that, probably 15 months ago or so that this started and of course, our believe as market leaders is that we should be slow to respond on the pricing side. We would like to maintain a premium pricing strategy, we think it's healthy for the industry over the long haul. And we think we deserve it, because were believe we have the best technologies and there the most efficacious for patients and the best of customers, form a quality perspective. What we have seen is last couple of quarters that we need to adjust some pricing to get back in line with market pricing, we made those adjustments.. We have not seen significant movement at all from a competition since field just come in from the marketplace and acquired. And we are very hopeful that discipline will maintain going forward, and I think we have a couple of large competitors that are quite reasonable that compete on quality, that compete on innovation, that compete on market growth. And that's certainly where we're focused and we feel that right now we've made the adjustments for the necessary.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, well thanks a lot. Thanks again and great quarter.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable. You may proceed.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Hey, guys congratulations on the great quarter here.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joshua.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Thanks for taking my questions. I'll be quick I'm sure there is a long line but Kieran just talking about U.S. market growth I know you talked about pricing being stable. Can you just sort of obviously there is some push back about people talk about the law of numbers in this market and I know you talked about the positive dynamics out there whether be no, co-mobility or what not. Obviously there is been some confusion in the marketplace over the past year. Can you just give us some sort of sense of volumes if you can believe sort of volumes out there are healthy? Right now we're going forward kind what you're seeing?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we seen a lot of good signals I think for market expansion over the last three months, six months I think that something comes up, either in clinical side from the awareness side et cetera that should be very positive in the long-term growth in the market. We've long said this market should be round at 10% to 15% ex-U.S. in the U.S. 15% to 20% to sort of blending around that 15%. And our feeling has been that is a sustainable figure, different drivers over different times. But it's a sustainable figure and our objective is always been to grow at and above market rate. The... if you look at where the markets growing now in the Americas previous question, I think we're about that market growth, I think the revenue growth rate is probably around that 13%, 14% or so volume growth is probably a few points above that probably around lets call 16% or so, so it remains a good robust marketplace. When you look at some of the drivers that have come out recently, they both well for the future and they both well for recognition that this market remains hugely, hugely under-penetrated. So let's just get a few examples, International Diabetes Federation statement. I don't think there is enough time and attention that is paid or understood about this because this is where you had leaders in the diabetes community coming together with terminologists or erotologists coming together with cardiologists. Looking at the clinical literature and saying there is absolutely a huge overlap between these orders, I mean some of the figures are up to 70% of diabetics have the disorder and it appears that we're not appears, the data shows that the primary issue the diabetic suffer from that they die from cardiovascular complications or exactly where the treatments sleep disorder breathing can support, can help, that means lowering of blood pressure, the treatment being used in heart failures, this is we're doing in our clinical study within Europe with survey chest, these things all tied together and say that is good medical practice and this is what the recommendation was it is good medical practice for type to diabetics to be squeal for sleep disorder breathe, that's never happened before this opens up a massive market opportunities in front of us, to bring people into the pipeline. There were just with view article and that was a co published in circulation inject, looking at the vast amount of clinical literature on cardiovascular disease and sleep disorder breathing now these things move to held stand accord. A very young stated that was again picked by MSMBC showing a sixth fold increase in risk, immortality if you got severe sleep disorder breathing, this is a massive issue that is costing healthcare systems around the globe billion of dollars and it remains under penetrated. Even it the home sleep testing like with all these different pieces that move with home sleep testing during the quarter. There is no way to look at home sleep testing other than say positive, positive, positive because anyway you look at it, it opens up the doors to more people being diagnose to simplifying the diagnostic process. Right, it is a positive step forward for this industry and will continue to be as we move forward. So we remain very, very optimistic about it. I think all these things when if that having multiple shots on goal right, not all of them have to hit all at once, each one can hit overtime and that's what feeds into this continued regular growth that we seen in the industry, this would happen in the past and it goes very well for what we believe is going to happen in the future.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. And then, I mean you touched upon that was sort of my follow up, just at home diagnostics, I mean a lot of people have sort of looked at these LCD's as a negative. I totally agree with you that having home testing is obviously better than not having it, anywhere you cut it, but you made a point to say that you seem to see them... see it in the market already as having some sort of impact, given that may be it's, Medicare is obviously a small part of it, so that's why the LCD's don't really matter or may be can you just kind of talk a little bit, I know it's early and I know LCDs kind of just came out, but sort of a what you are seeing on a home testing, I know you have alluded that fact that's helping, but can you just add a little bit more color there on the specifics?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, sure. I mean we negative a good point, Joshua which is which is always important for us to remind ourselves that in Americas, the Medicare population is only 20% of the population being addressed. That being said, I was very encouraged to see that and some right sort of country's largest insurers [ph] jumped on Board with home sleep testing. Of course, there is a lot of movement in the early days with the LCDs. Even if these things are coming out, some of them still point back to the old national coverage decision, right? I mean, for this... where we get these government bureaucracies, there is always a little bit of confusion in the early days. There is a little bit of too and fro. But anyway you look at it, what is it's doing, it's validating that home sleep testing is a valid way in addition to PSG and in addition, and in combination with the sleep test because we still remain firmly partnered with the sleep community and we see some very innovative sleep physicians who are at beginning of the early days of home sleep testing, where they are reaching out to some other physicians in their community, some of them are CMS related, many of them quite frankly are more private payroll oriented and saying, hey, can we increase the diagnostic capacity. So, look, I think early days on these changes are always a little bit balancing. The think is to take the step back, look at it and say is the ball moving down the court or not and the answer is firmly, yes. The ball is moving firmly down the court and we believe it's going to continue to move that way.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great, well interesting. Congrats and thanks again guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thanks Joshua.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. You may proceed.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up, I am sorry Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I said hey Ben.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Hey, I was trying to follow-up with a couple of things about sort kind of tying into things. The DME activity, are you seeing any shift in behavior, versus in the last six months as a result of some resolution on the local coverage decisions or the home testing, etcetera that are moving the needle here, because I think you're talked about volume growth picking up a bit.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, right. In some ways it's a little hard to segment out, because at the same time all these changes we are occurring, we're launching the S8 II platform with Easy-Breath. And so we have seen a very significant up-tick, particularly again in the auto setting part of that business. Part of that is clearly attributable to people preparing themselves for home sleep testing that's part of feedback that we get. And part of that is clearly attributable to the fact that were, we are gaining share in that category. So I think --
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Can you tell what's what or you just can't?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: I think it will be really hard for us to guesstimate at that.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, but clearly there's been a significant shift in your volumes?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: There's clearly been a... we are growing clearly growing more quickly at that high end and that leads to mix shift, yes.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, are you seeing growth in the low end of the product line, is that stabilizing where units are back up and even lower mid-single digits now?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We're seeing more stabilization in that category. And I will also say in that category we haven't yet seen the impact of Q4. We didn't see impact of the Escape II, it was launched towards the end of the quarter, at the end of fiscal year. So the reality is that sales force is now custom [ph] a lot attention on it. I expect that we will see that moving forward.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay. So, but volume growth overall for the business unit growth, rather is turned distinctly positive,
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: At versus where it was.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, and then the underlying kind of concept of the competitive bidding dynamic and now they are going to delay the implementation and implement whatever, it is a 9% or so cut. And they list the demonstration areas and that goes national. Have you seen the impact of that already in the business, or is it that something that we are going to stare down later in the year?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Well, a couple of points to make on that. First I think the, what we heard from the industry was a collect sigh of relief, when that comprise was met. And the reason is it takes a lot of uncertainty at as of HME were feeling. They weren't sure exactly what they prep for. In other words many of the HMEs that won the bid didn't have a presence and the communities where they had won the bid there was a confusion around how they are going to care for those patients, is patient care going to be maintained in all that. So I think that in the first step was there was a really a collective sigh of relief that alright this is good compromise. I think the second part of it is I think you remember the CMS was the high priced player in the marketplace. Right so, most of private insurers will also already priced well below where we had seen the CMS side of the business. So and the final pieces is just to remind ourselves that 9.5% cut as I understand not implemented to January 1. So its gives people the time to sort of work through the strategies for growth in one hour. What... I will say one side, if we look back was about three years ago when there was significant option in that net cuts in the industry, and I remember distinctly of the time of having a conversations around what that going to mean is this a real negative industry. And the reality is the proceeded a significant growth in the sleep industry because HME are businesses and the HME need to look for avenues of growth and what they saw at that time, there is an area we can grow and its sleep and in fact where they tend to really grows in the compliant user side, we're getting more efficient to that the supply of mass, the patient because realized that they had under-penetrated that market but they under serve that marketplace and so the consequence is very different, that was anticipated. It was instruct able to look back on history to see how some of these things are played out.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Certainlyclarity goes a long way, the other side of this I guess is the gross margin because other than that issue in the quarter this is a strong result, if you think about your opportunities that you laid you out previously, are we talking hundreds of basis points, are we talking stabilization in 12 months?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So we've got different line items that are going to contribute different levels in that I think that and there are going to come at various times, that's good part of this right, again its not a single shot on goal we got multiple ways of addressing the opportunity for margin expansion, I think it's going to be a continuing, it's not going to be overnight one step, it's going to be improvement that we're going to see over the months and over series of time right. So some of those things are going to happen quickly like the Bilevel products right and they're launching and right the middle of launching those now and the Swift LT out for the full quarter, we'll be right in a mid there, that's for the shorter-term. All those products that we have in the pipeline will be hitting during the year, the manufacturing in Asia that will be coming more in towards the back of the year where we see the improvements. Supply chain, we've already begun that process in a number of months ago, so we're already starting to see some of the dividends that'll be playing. It's going to play itself out I think all the time.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: But again if we look at 12 months, you've got... you probably don't want to give specifics about the impact of going into a lower cost environment but are those going to be offset overall by continued price declines are we looking at absolute improvements in gross margins from the 58% or from the 68% level, or 60% level?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think when we look at all that 12 month horizon we should be able to see improvements.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Versus the 58 or the 60?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Certainly versus the 58% and 60% possibly.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay. I mean, we all crystal balls, but you get a little bit more information. So that's very helpful. Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. No, no, I guess my summary on that is we feel very confident with the actions that we're taking, the product pipeline and with the very specific actions that we're taking on margin expansion.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Right. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys, can you hear me?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Maybe, I can just start with some shop keeping questions. Kieran, I think you gave us the U.S growth rate for flow generators, but I may have missed the number from masks and the U.S. numbers?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I want to Brett was actually the guy, he went through all the details, he's got closest line there.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: For the Americas flow generators increased by 8%.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Yes.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: And masks and other was 18%.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Great.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Then for the South Americas [ph] that flow generators was up 24% and masks and other was up 49%.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: 49%, great and then I think you said by that your net income excluding amortization and the recall charge was at $33.2 million which if my math is right gives you a tax rate of about 29.1% which was about 140 basis points drop versus the previous quarter. Is that reckon what would you guys have?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it's was around 29% for the quarter pretty close to that and if you look at the full year rate was little over the 33 mark.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I see.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Going forward and that 30% mark probably realistic...
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. 30%. Can you just help us understand what the any particular items were, perhaps here in the fourth quarter, that help you guys that are on the bottom line with the tax rate, just provide a little clarity in terms of what's driving that tax rate here in the quarter, please?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, so I would say the quarter some of that relights to some of the R&D concessions we get down here in Australia. We had a particularly strong quarter here lock in R&D spend for the quarter that will manifest it self in the effective tax rate, because of some of the tax concessions we get. And a continuation of the German tax rates which are kind of down at the beginning of the year, that's off to around 10% and Germany is doing well in those profits are coming through as lower tax rates. So, I mean there's a myriad of them, but there might be the two major ones.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, then one down in north [ph] and then the German tax rate being the two big drivers here in the quarter. Great.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes and as the Germany would have been with us for the full year that we continue to get that impact quarter-on-quarter.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Great, Kieran you guys have given some pretty good details on some what you think the drivers can be on the gross margin line. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to operating expenses? You've given some guidance to us on the R&D lines, but with respect to the SG&A line, can you may be comment a little bit on how you're feeling about the need to invest over the upcoming fiscal year '09, with the sales force in terms of market development activities for either their home testing opportunity to help out your DME customers or alternatively some of the areas, if you like you need to perhaps bone up on when, it comes to getting some more feet on the street to help with the new products that you have coming out here?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so I've been first of all, I've been very pleased with the performance of the global team and controlling operating expense, growth particularly during the time when as you know, there is foreign currency impact has been a challenge in controlling that headline. But we are looking on a constant currency basis. It's been just some very good cost control. Part of that is activities that we are engaged in throughout the globe, as an example that we described as an ops of the continuous improvement down in Australia, we are doing the same thing in Americas here using lean techniques in order to reduce efficiencies. I should say increase efficiencies, reduce elements that are interfering with our efficiencies. So a good standard operating procedure that gives me comfort that as we move forward that the dollars that we spend, will be spend in a right place which is market expansion, which is feet on the street, which is the ability to grow market share. Alright? So I think that we're doing the right things and have been doing the right things about focusing on efficiencies and focusing on market expansion opportunities. I think when at the operating cost as a percentage of revenues, you've seen we gained a little bit of leverage here in the last quarter. And I expect to continue that, but we are spending about the right level. We are not going to take our foot off the accelerators or too many good things happening in this industry. There is too much opportunity to try to reduce that to some level that would start critical initiatives. So I think we are going to continue the balanced approach, picking up efficiencies and some leverage as move forward, but making sure that we invest appropriately and expanding this highly and underserved marketplace.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you for that Kieran and then something that's been off the radar for a little bit is Simi [ph] or ResMed Paris, can you perhaps give us an update as to where those sales stand perhaps in terms of your U.S. markets and maybe when we can potentially look forward to some of these things... these products from the same acquisition looking coming into the U.S. market here?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so we continue to make good strides with the ventilation product line and the organization here is just seems to improve by the day. We continue to invest in them and they continue to respond to that investment. They've got a very a good product pipeline, a part of what we've done is gone in and done some significant product pipeline reengineering which is going to, we think going to significantly up-tick or increase our ability for market penetration overtime, it also delays a little bit. So our thought there is if we are going to swing we are going to swing the best, we are going for the big impact, as opposed to simply trying to make incremental changes or improvements. So we are doing well, that business doing is quite well ex-U.S. it's not yet time to bring it into the U.S. and we are not giving any specific timelines on that. But I can I can tell you I'm very pleased with the progress.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: And maybe if you can just give us a sense of where that business is going in terms of sales for the run rate?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: We historically have not broken out to that level of details. So I feel little bit uncomfortable getting too much detail.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: But just to say that it's positive and it's doing well and we're pleased with the performance.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. I'll take [indiscernible] out of that. And, a last one, just in terms of the U.S sales force, you said, you've laid out a very clear strategy here in terms of that putting the feet on the street. In terms of... and obviously had a very nice results here in the U.S. Is that the sort of result do you want to expect and given the nice product cycle you guys have coming here and that we can potentially expect going forward for over the next couple of quarters here with the U.S growth rate and, is there something you feel like will start to generate returns more in the near term or is it just to help us understand the timing of these investments and spending coming through. Thank you and I'll turn back into queue
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Okay if I understand the question correctly Paul, with that prospect in the near term I think that there are number of factors which are signals of encouragement, to my perspective to the Americas. Certainly the products flow as you know had been very strong I mean we hit the market. People care about compliance and in fact some of legislative changes moving forward probably are just going to increased the emphasis on compliance and with flow generators if you got the right algorithms and we absolutely have a market leading algorithms when you can reduce noise and on some products up to 90%. I really think about that up to 90% in a market at this point. They're important for the individual and they're important for the partner and help to buy this plan [ph] another things that makes me feel very comfortable that we have a seller U.S sales of course that is executing very well and I feel that if we speculate their executing even better their well trained with testing [ph]
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we've got a lot of opportunities to [indiscernible]. Marsha?
Operator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson from Wachovia Capital Partners. Please proceed.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Hi.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hello.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: I guess first of all I know you talked a little bit about the cut that facing your customers on due to the competitive bidding '08 just wondering how much if any of that 9.5% cut you think you'll end up having to bare?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes it's always hard to say, this is marketplace where every year people are coming with cup and hand and kind of things and I don't expect that to change in this year then in another year. But I think one of the positive things that is happened is we've absorbed a lot of the price compression over this last year, right, so there was some pretty significant movement and I think that has taken a lot of pressure of the HME's that might have otherwise been there. And we're hearing from the HME's this point is looked they're looking for quality products they at a competitive price that we've been able to make the adjustment necessary to be in that competitive price range and they're also looking for future that going to make their life easier because many of them recognizing that this is about the cost not just about the price that they buy something with. It's about quality and we by far have the market leading quality products in this industry and that has a big effect on their ability to serve and I mean one of the funny things about rising oil prices is these guys run a lot of trucks and if they have got to go out to patients homes and they have to go for multiple calls because of quality issues that's going to cost their money, they don't want to deal with that, they think the same way on the masks side. So I think that we have been on one side very fortunate but I think it's on the other side it's been part of our very specific strategy that people are recognizing the cost advantages of the cost savings associated with quality products.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay. Aand then I was wondering if you've noticed or heard of any dollar reports of an economic impact on the demand for sleep studies and or CPAP equipment.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's really no new news on that; I think the last couple of quarters have been no real significant development that we're not here to lot about it.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay. And then given that year-to-date or you've launched the Escape II or sorry, S8 Escape... S8 II Escape, is there any risk that that's going to drive a negative mix shift, now that you're pushing some features down onto the lower end units?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think what we are doing is, we have taken a lower cost platform and we have been able to take the EPR, the Esptr [ph] the expletory pressure release function and be able to put it on that lower cost platform by doing some, I think some very innovative things. So, one of the things that refused to compromise on was quality of care and in that pressure release category, the different solutions are different and we feel very comfortable as though our customers that the EPR feature offers the most efficacious treatment and for that category of pressure relief, the secret though here was the ability to take that mode of care or therapy and be able to put it over to a platform that costs less fro us to make and allows us to be more price efficient in the marketplace.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay, and then just a question on your stock-based compensation. Can you give us out of that $5.3 million of how much of that was in... went into the SG&A category, how much that went in the R&D category?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Brett, do you want to handle that.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the most of it was in the SG&A. It's around, half a million, three-quarter of million in R&D and the balance is in SG&A, it's high bidding cost is up.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay. And is the $5.3 million number I assume is before tax?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay, can you give me what number would be net of tax?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the tax rate around there is roughly the 30% mark touch on that.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners: Okay, alright. That's all I've got. Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thanks very much. Marsha, I think we've time for another question.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you very much for taking my question. I am sort of a pattern girl. And you broke two patterns in this quarter, and it's been a topic of most of questions, but I want to another second or two on it, you went from16% revenue growth to 23% revenue growth. You went from 60% gross margin to 58.4%gross margins. How do we think about without giving guidance? Where do we go from here, is this the new starting point? Do I think about revenue growth again revenue growth again in the 20% plus range for ResMed and recovering gross margins. How do we think about that?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Joanne, you're absolutely right. We don't give specific guidance on that. So I'll go back to our statement we made earlier which is to say that we feel that on from a market perspective that the outside the U.S. we feel comfortable with long-term sustainable growth of 10% to 15% in the U.S. and the Americas we feel comfortable with the 15% to 20%. So market growth that is sustainable in that mid teens and we feel we can grow at and above as we have historically market growth so I'd say on what our prospects moving forward are... we feel very comfortable that we can get back to and are back to that level of growth. There is lot of things that impact both of those line items and a single quarter doesn't make a trend certainly in anyway but we're feeling very comfortable with where we're out in our life cycle.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay.Any change in the competitive landscape with respond extreme part of Philips?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: No I think, no we are very hopeful that Philips has a reputation for competing in marketplaces by focusing on innovation and market expansion. That's the way we like to compete in a marketplace and we think that help us for these long-term growth of the marketplace. And there is nothing that gives us pause at this point.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: And is there are reasons you're taking the $3.1 million charge for the S8 recall now in the fourth quarter?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: This was... we felt at this point that it was predictable amount, but I remind everybody that's within 5% of our original estimates. And we felt it was time an appropriate to give the true up.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And Kieran you're anticipating future troops?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: At this point is as Brett had mentioned earlier we feel that this should be up.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you for your questions.
Operator: And I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran T. Gallahue for his final remarks. Please proceed, sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, great thanks Marsha and thank you all for your time and attention. I think as many of you have noted this was a very strong quarter for ResMed from the top-line growth that was we think quite exceptional to these strong results that came out of Americas across the board right on down to the record breaking cash. So we were very pleased with performance. I'm very proud of our employees throughout the globe and through all functions in the company who've all contributed to that. And I look forward to updating you on the next conference call.
Operator: Thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 ResMed Earnings Conference Call. My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, the company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as, projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Angela and welcome all of you to ResMed's Q3 2008 conference call. I am going to start the call today with some remarks and I am going to pass the ball over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer and he will review the results in more detail then will come and open up for Q&A. Well Q3 was our 52nd quarter of consecutive growth and was a strong quarter for us as we grew our revenues by 16% on a global basis and we grew our earnings per share by 12% on a global basis. As well as generating over $33 million in cash flow from operations. In particular, this was a great quarter to reinforce the strategy of ResMed globalization. Right from beginning of this company, we focused on two things. Innovation and internationalization and this was a great quarter to reap some of the rewards of that as we saw the international business contributing significantly to our growth in the quarter. Let me, I think step back for minute and review some of the results. From a product perspective, Mask grew up 21% on a global basis and that Mask growth was supported by not only existing products, but also the introduction of new product of the product category. We introduced the Mirage Micro nasal mask. It's the first major release of technologies that work horse nasal mask section of the business in last four years. It came in promptly through the quarter. It has been received very well through, from the market place and it's just a great product. It helps in set up. It took the lot of the advantages that we saw in Mirage Quattro, full face mask integrated in nasal platform and we are getting similar reviews as we did Quattro indicating that the ease of use in setup, the efficacy of the products are absolutely fabulous. We are very pleased with the early introductory days of the Mirage Micro. Full face mask continue to be strong performance for us, particularly the Mirage Quattro, product in the and high-end of the full face mask line, so very strong productive category for us. Nasal pillows was a bit more of a mixed category for us. We continue to have the Swift II product line which has performed very well and continues to have a large share in fact the vast majority of the share of the nasal pillows market place. We have seen some competitive pressures in that in the last couple of quarters. They continued in this quarter. The good news on that by the way is that within the next week at Medtrade, we will be launching a new product into the nasal pillows category to product called the Swift LT. And we are going to introduce it as in adjunct. So not a replacement for the Swift II, but it has enough new feature sets and it is differentiated enough that it deserves its own place in the product category. So moving forward, we will have both those products the Swift II and the Swift LT and nasal pillows category and we're looking forward to some strong success out of that product line. Alright, let me move over to the Flow Generators, flow generators and global basis were up 11% and this was an area where in particular we had certain light on, that really performed well. As an example, in the Bilevel range, we have our VPAP series. And we introduced something called the VPAP Auto, midway through the last quarter. And again, this product came out of the gates very strongly. We're very encouraged by the early days of the launch and look forward to strong days ahead with the VPAP Auto. A key element of the VPAP Auto is that it merges a couple of technologies. On one side, it brings in the auto setting out rhythms that we've used in the APAP line for years. The market leading preemptive, very efficacious product category or algorithm used in the AutoSet APAP line. But it's also integrated something you're going to be hearing a lot more about, which is the Easy-Breath technology. And the Easy-Breath technology is really... it's a product category of platform under which we have both waveforms, as they're intended to improve patient's compliance and improve the efficacy of treatment. As well as a new motor, which is bring substantial value to the product line, in fact it was the basis of the very successful S8 II product line that we've launched in the international markets. The Easy-Breathe technology is a double-ended motor, that allows us to improve performance and it vastly, vastly decreases the noise. We've got a saying here that silence is compliance, it's because it's so important in order to reduce noise levels for both the patient and for the bed partner. And this is an example of where we're bringing that technology to bear [ph] and Bilevel, so good early days on that. On the higher end flow generators such as the AutoSet line, we continue to do well and we believe is a share gain position and that high-end of the market place. And very importantly and very, from a very exciting point from our view is as we speak we're launching new products in the Americas, into that category. So we're launching the S8 II Vantage [ph] and the S8 II (sic) [S8 Elite II]. The market overall will see it next week at Medtrade. It uses again that basic Easy-Breathe technology platform, both the waveforms as well as the very silent and high-performance Easy-Breathe motor. So we we're very excited about that. It's been a successful launch that we launched several months ago in international markets and its part of the contribution to our significant growth in those international markets. Lower end flow generated a bit more of a mixed bag there. What we have been finding is that a, certain feature set and particularly that feature set is expiratory, pressure release, where you have that up and down of the pressure in order to improve comfort and therefore, compliance among patients. We've seen that, there's been significant growth of that feature set in the low-end. It is not a feature set that we've had and as a result we've had some competitive pressures in that end of our product line. Good news here is that we will be releasing a product. We are going to call the S8 II escape with Easy-Breathe technology, alright with EPR, with Expiratory Pressure Relief. And that will be launched later in this quarter, will not be released to Medtrade, but will be released later in this quarter, and we'll begin shipping we believe before the end of the quarter. So non-material impact in this quarter, but great news as we move forward in plugging a whole, that we have in the product line that will allows us to be more competitive. Alright, let me take step back for just moment and talk about the market overall, I'd like to address two areas. One is co-morbidities and the other is home testing. Just to set the tones for the market as we move forward. This last quarter was actually very interesting and very encouraging quarter from the co-morbidity perspective, in particular, in the area of diabetes and the overlap between type II diabetes and sleep disorder breathing. There were several papers that were published in peer-reviewed journals that I think were important to this. One in particular was Vancorder et. al. [ph] in Chest that was released, I believe in February, and it was a review article looking at literature, that associated and that determined the overlap between sleep disorder breathing and Type II diabetes. What was really interesting about this is, is that it was a cross over that was, it was published in this clinical literature, but you saw very soon thereafter that there was pick-up in the more general press and that's always an important aspect for us as we look to move from the clinical silos in to the more general awareness and speaks well for future market expansion. In particular, many of you may have seen the 60 minute segments, several weeks ago, where they actually had two segments that featured two of the authors on that paper, Edward Tuscali and Eva Vancorder [ph] and they were only talking about sleep fragmentation and deprivation, not the full boat of sleep disorder breathing, but the end results become the same. They were showing that with healthy young males in their early 20s that, if you are sleep deprive them even for a couple of days then you start to see the symptoms of pre-diabetes. And it is very interesting way of beginning to educate the public on this overlap between type II diabetes and sleep disorder breathing, why its important to treat the sleep disorder breathing and to appropriately allow people to sleep without that fragmentation and be able to take away some of the other negative effects of sleep disorder breathing and why it should help in what is considered there other primary disorder to the extent that you want to call it. So very encouraging news, there is other news in that category, I won't go to depth on it, but it's important for us to note when we have these significant movements on the co-morbidity side. The other significant development during the quarter was in home testing in the Americas, in the United States. Many of you are aware that during the quarter, that the CMS, it's a Medicare came out with its final ruling on the national coverage decision for the use of home testing for the diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing. And in fact their final ruling confirmed their preliminary ruling from December and the net result is that they have approved home testing. They have approved in conjunction with polysomnography, so either course is acceptable in the determination of sleep disorder breathing and the movement of those patients into the care cycle to allow them to get treatment. Now as this rolls out, we believe this is going to be absolutely fantastic news for the patients and we believe for the sleep community. It's going to take a good 12 to 18 months. We still believe that in order for water to flow under the bridge and for us to see any material impact of these types of the developments. There is multiple steps that need to occur with movement from a national coverage decision to local coverage decisions having private insurers pick up the coverage of home testing and one, Aetna, a very large one has already picked it up which I think was a very positive signal and I suspect over the coming quarters we'll see others that will also pick up the coverage of home testing. Key for us during this time period as we intend to support our partners in sleep community, we feel that in this changing environment that they can play a very important role in expanding the access of care to patients integrating a home testing along with their PSG in the treatment of their patients. And it will also give other parts of the healthcare community incentives to be engaged in the diagnoses process. So the key here is a couple of developments along the co-morbidity side, one on the home testing side, both which we think are very, very health indicators for the growth of the market as we move forward. Both which have some time line associated with, but both which we think are going to have significant long-term impact. So instead of continuing on that one, I turn the phone over Brett, Brett will go through the results in more detail and it will come back and take your questions. Brett.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Great thanks Kieran. So I'll briefly run through our March quarter results. Revenue for the March quarter was $211.8 million, an increase of 16% over the prior quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $12 million to our Q3 revenues. Our income from operations are $37.4 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $29.7 million. Diluted earnings per share for the current quarter was $0.38 which represents an increase of 12%, compared to the prior year quarter that's excluding voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized in the March, quarter last year. SG&A for the quarter was $70.1 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by modest 6% over the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33%, compared to the year ago figure of 34%. R&D expense for the quarter was $15 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expense was consistent with prior year. As the percentage of revenue, our R&D was 7% and again this was consistent with the year ago figure. With our ongoing commitment to innovation, solid product pipeline and some clinical trial commitments, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continue in the 7% range through the balance of FY '08. Amortization of the acquired intangibles is $2 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.6 million. During the March quarter, there were three non-routine transactions that impacted our net income and I will run through these. First, we made a gain of $5.9 million on the completion of the previously announced sell and leaseback transaction on our Poway property in San Diego. Second, we recognized an expense of $3.2 million associated with the write-down of certain at cost investments. And third, we made a $2 million donation for the ResMed Foundation during the quarter. The aggregated net after-tax, impact of these transactions was a decrease in net income of approximately $0.2 million. So the bottom-line impact of all those transactions was negligible. Turning to revenues in more detail, overall, Americas sales was $99.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior quarter. Sales outside of the Americas totaled $112.2 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenues between products segments, in the Americas flow generators were 5% lower, than the prior year quarter. While masks and other increased by 13%, reflecting the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions. For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 23% over the prior year quarter, reflecting increasing in momentum in S8 II sales, while masks and others increased by 33% again driven by strong new product sales. As Kieran indicated on a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 11% while mask and other on a group basis increased by 21%. Cash flow from operations was $33.9 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $17.3 million and this included a $7.5 million in building construction costs associated with new headquarters in San Diego. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $14.7 million. We received $24.7 million in cash from the sale of our Poway property and these funds will be utilized for the ongoing construction of our San Diego headquarters. During the quarter, we also repurchased 575,000 shares for consideration of $23.3 million, despite our ongoing share buyback program and today on this program. We've repurchased 3.5 million shares out of a total approved buyback of $8 million shares. Looking at the balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong total assets at the end of the March were $1.4 billion and net equity is $1.1 billion. Cash in cash equivalents, net of our external debt was $175 million at the end of March. I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thanks Brett. Well, why don't we jump right into the Q&A section? So Angela if you could lead us there, please. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, we would ask that you limit your self to one question and one follow-up question originally. Thank you and sir your first question will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Hi, good afternoon,
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey Ben.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: I guess the first thing is maybe let's talk about where the market are at in the U.S and in Europe. The U.S basically, obviously you're continuing to struggle with generators. Tell us what you think underlying patient unit growth is, as well as and the second part of really is, what do you think is going to happen with these new products coming out and can you get back to a point where you're taking back share, even yet in the next couple of quarters?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Great question, so we think on a global basis that the market is growing at about a 15% or so rate and obviously we are out performing that on the international basis and we've had some challenges as you know on the U.S side, particularly in the flow generator side of the business. As far as visibility in the patient flow, that's always difficult one to say. I think this quarter was an unusual one, from the perspective that you had a lot going on in the market place. On one side you had home testing, NCD coming out, you had some fluctuations in the economy on the other side, and of course you had competitive bidding. So I think to a certain extent, we saw some impact on the HME side, as they just sort of took a little breather, and said let me just make sure, I understand what's going on here before I build too much inventor, on your question on products and actually very, very excited about the product flow that we have coming through. The... part of this success that we have seen in the international markets, is has been contributed not only by the mask product line which is really doing quite well in market places that historically has been more difficult to grow. But, also on the flow generator side where we have introduced the SA II products already with the Easy-Breathe technology, and so we're getting some really strong market feedback on that. That's very comforting. On the U.S side, as we look into this quarter, we've got two products that we will be introducing in that high-end, so we've got the APAP product and the Elite. We'll have the full quarter of the VPAP Auto which we didn't have during the last quarter. And we will be entering although, it'd be later in the quarter, so much less of an impact, but I think it's very important that we're entering the other lower segment with EPR. On escape platform, so I think that plugs a whole that we were clearly struggling with it a little bit, and I think and quite frankly, I think its going to be better for patients in the long run, because what it's doing is bringing down a compliance oriented type of feature set into that category. We had some real good competitive wins here recently that we haven't seen the impact fully of, we've had a strategy of trying to make sure that we participate in all segments of the market. We have seen a win here within the last couple of months, where we became the primary supplier to Praxair on a global basis, and for the first time in our history with Apria, we are going to be on a level playing field in their essential care model, and that's really the ink is just drying on that agreement at this point. But, so as we look forward, I think it's going to give us access both on a product and on a customer basis to some win that we didn't have here in the last few quarters. So, I am actually very optimistic about it.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Just a quick follow up, I mean pricing dynamics in the U.S stable, getting worse and that kind of roll off the impact later this year and then maybe Brett can follow up with what the currency impact could be for the balance of this year, rates stay the same? Thanks.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, alright great thanks for the question. So on the pricing, I would say the same thing, I did last quarter, which is that, we have not seen the floor that was established several quarters ago go any lower, which is good news and that's what we look for. So, if you go back three quarters, four quarters ago or so, when we started to see some of the significant price pressures and that's when we are talking about some deals that were quite challenging, we are not seeing prices go below that still. What does happen in this market place is that you see those early deals out of few customers and that rolls across the customer base. So basically this market is inefficient in the short-term and I mean it's efficient in the longer-term. So what that means is that we see the effect on average sale prices, sort of integrate over the series of quarter and I know we've still got several quarters and where that's sort of coming through on that curve. But what we look at is to see, was the floor established and we have been encouraged by what we have seen in the market place.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Great and Brett.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes Ben, on the currency side, this quarter impact was a little bit viable for us because the euro was particularly strong and we did have some hedging gains this quarter. The... looking forward if you look at sort of currency rates, as they are... I mean it is hard to predict it, depends on the dynamics of the euro, versus the Aussie and so on, but with getting through sort of $0.01 positive, $0.01 negative, up to maybe $0.02 max. And I see that going forward, there could be a stage that have $0.01 detriment throughout Q4, but I don't say it's been particular significant and again it really does depend on how the currencies move. With the hedging in place and they are exposed, I don't think its going to impact significantly, but it can be $0.01 or $0.02 either side of EPS.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: But on the top line it would be another $10 million or $12 million a quarter, is that going to start to come back down, because the year-over-year rates getting a bit tighter?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, if you see U.S sort of... U.S, its 156-157 pretty high, so I would suspect that it will sort of come through roughly that sort of number again on the top-line?
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Okay, great thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Ben.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Paul Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Thanks, can you guys hear me?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, we can Paul. Thanks for your call.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Yes, Okay great thanks. If you could may be start with home testing, now that you guys have had some time to review the... review the ruling, could you give us perhaps your sense of how the paradigm will evolve here, given some of the ambiguities in the documents and since that if a person does test, for instance, positive on a home test, how you see them ultimately getting on to a device, is it going back to overlap to be titrated with the confirmatory PSG and so forth, if you can walk through how you envision that process developing, and secondly how you see the DMEs and physicians, ultimately allocating the reimbursement for that. And if you can sort of give, how you envision that, perhaps a year or 18 months down the road? That would be great?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, okay, great. Lot of water has to flow under the bridge here. So what we're doing is we're listening to our customers. We're listening to the sleep community, we are listening to the HME community and we are seeing what... since they are the ones at the cold phase, we're seeing... what are you trying to do, how are you going to handle this, how are you in some cases lobbying, what do you think those success... success for that will be? So my guess is what's going to happen is it's going to be a number of business models. They are going to come out over the coming months that are going to try to influence speed and net outcome of this. Right, so we've got I think some of the leading sleep physicians who are trying to look at this on the on the hub and spoke model and they are saying you know what, this is a change that I can grow my business with and why I am going to use this is to augment the PSGs, and particularly the ones that are hybrids. They are both dispensing as well as doing diagnosis, you'll hear mixed reviews. Some of them want to bring people back in and do titration, other ones wants to keep the beds open so that they can use those for diagnosis of the more complex patients and use the home testing for the sample. So I think this is probably going to be both regionally and locally that in the next X number of months you are going to see people trying each of those and I think CMS is going to have to do what they are most comfortable with and what they feel provides the best care at the most economic level.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'd hate to try to guess what the government's going to doing. But I think that whichever way it leads to the right economics. I think we will be adopting quite frankly, from our perspective, anyway you look at that, we win and I think the patients win and I think that will be positive as we move forward. There are other players that are trying to play a role here... we hear window of HMEs trying to play roles of IDTF, so of other players and the healthcare community and they will all try to figure out if there is a role for themselves in that market place where they can in many cases take the technical component and provide the read fee or the professional fee to either the sleep physician or other sleep trained physicians in the process. So again, I think what you are probably going to see there is that the HMEs and some of these other players are going to try to partner with the sleep community or other parts of the healthcare community to try to figure out, how they can on one side minimize near-term channel conflict, while building relationships with their key referral sources. So, it's Paul its real mixed bag now, but I think that's going to be good. I think it's good because there is a lot of activity, there is a lot of interest. We are certainly getting a lot of queries about our ApneaLink with Oximetry, because it is a very simple device. It is highly accurate. Sleep physicians have been using it as part of their hub-and-spoke model now for several years and it is very well positioned to help them as they think through the model, that's going to best both for their own business, as well as for patient care. So water needs to flow under bridge, but I think it's all positive momentum.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Then a follow-up for Brett; if you don't mind, just on the investment write-down, can you comment on what it is specifically and what about change it from a temporary to a permanent impairment. And secondly, on the inventory side, it did step up I think you said a little over $3 million. How much of that is perhaps ApneaLink related or how much of it is intense anticipation of buildup for Medtrade here? And I will hop off, thanks.
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Okay. So on the write-down couple of that cost investments were the few trigger events that happened in the quarter on each of those. One of the entities did announce during the quarter, they had a significant goodwill write-down and it was significant, compared to the overall market cap of that company. So we took the view that after some significant write-downs and significant reduction in their share cost and this is in the slag in 10-Q over the last while is potential unrealized loss there. So in this quarter, we basically bit the bullet and write that down based on that trigger event, same with another, there was another small one in there as well in that, they have really decided to abandon the business model and looks like weren't going to get from that, so we also wrote that one-one off as well. So its couple of trigger events that moved it from temporary to what we thought was a permanent impairment. On the entry levels, aren't too bad, this combination is a little bit of some stocking to get ready for things like, it's like S8 II launch in the U.S for example, which is adding a little bit there. You do tend to get some currency impacting on that as well. If the U.S weakens against the Euro, obviously the euro, the European stockholdings would go up as well just on just on translation impact. So, it's a combination of level of items there.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks lot guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks Paul.
Operator: And gentlemen again next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess I was wondering given what happened with the home testing reimbursement. Do you think that there is possibility or is there anything in the works to get reimbursement coverage for the auto setting units?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, thanks for the question Mike. It's a good question. It's a hard one to predict. I can tell you that as soon as we saw the preliminary NCD, we did go back to the well; we did work with our Washington consultants and put together a modified version of what we had tried before on the auto setting because we think it's the right thing for the patients. We think it's the right thing for our homecare providers, and we think it's going to be the right thing overall for the sleep community to have appropriate reimbursement for these auto setting devices. So we are definitely taking a bite of that cherry. We think that the case makes sense, both economically and for patient care, but once again it's always so hard to predict, the way the government's going to move in, and I would be very hesitant to give you a specific prediction on that, but what I can tell you we're doing whatever we can support channel on that.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay, and your U.S business, this is... it slowed once again here. What's going on and, I mean do... when do you expect that to reaccelerate, and do you expect it to reaccelerate, I guess?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the answer is yes, we do. So let me reveal little bit about what we have been faced with. This quarter was a good example of where there is just a mixed bag we had some very positive results, some good indicators on the high-end product line. So VPAP Auto was very encouraging and only partial quarter impact was very encouraging. The movement towards additional use of auto setting devices which again is why we want to go back to that, that realm. We think it's appropriate for our HMEs to be appropriately compensated for that. But we're seeing even in advance to that we're seeing a higher movement towards, many of these auto setting devices. Where we struggled was in that lower-end, and really it has to do with not having expiratory pressure release in the lower-end devices. The market has clearly told us that they feel that that is a valuable feature set. It's when it sells well in the higher-end of our product range and they have told us that it is important they believe in the patient compliance and therefore, we need to have that in that range of products. That is exactly why we accelerated our product development cycle on that product and am actually very pleased with the efforts of the team, and most importantly the results of the team in being able to position that for a launch, later in this quarter. So I think that's going to be important. I also think on a mask side, the Mirage Micro is coming out exactly as we would hope it would. It's a great product and it compliments our product lines the Swift II and the Quattro. In the nasal pillows that Swift II we were holding a lions share of that market and we are going to shift away a little bit with some new interest. This Swift LT that will be coming out later in the quarter and will be there for everybody to see it Medtrade, it's just a fantastic product. It's both efficacious, it is very significantly differentiated from the Swift II, it takes the best parts of it and then it also gives it a different products forum and that's gives a people choice with an Nasal Pillow segment, they don't have to look outside of ResMed to get a choice of product forums. So that's positive. And I also think that looking at some of these customers wins that I was talking about, participating in some those segments, particularly some of the larger counts. I mentioned the win at Praxair, I mentioned the win for the level playing field that we now have at Apria that we hadn't enjoyed before. I think those are important aspects as we gain back our step here and I think also then on the back drop of that whole thing, because I think your question at the end it sounded even broader, will it come back? I think that the signals in this market place both on co-morbidities and the home testing are very, very good indicators for the long-term health of this industry. I remain very confident of that.
Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right, thanks Mike.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next quarter comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks David and welcome to the coverage.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. Hey, just, can you give us some update on competitive biding. What are your conversations with the DMEs going like and any additional color you can provide and how that's progressing?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Sure. So with competitive bidding, they released the first 10 MSAs, the results of those first 10 MSAs, and as you know there is many, many MSAs throughout the United States. And with the feedback from HMEs, a couple of things, one is that in this market place only about 20% of the patients that are served our Medicare age. So it sort of dampens the effect to some extent, that being said it's certainly causing lot of conversations within the HMEs. We heard one large customer in the last couple of days in fact in your public comments was very vocal and what they are doing to try to communicate with CMS, their dissatisfaction with the process even though it's a customer, an HME that's well served by these types of decisions, because the business model supports it. The basic feeling of the HME community is that this not the best thing for patient care, and that they will very aggressively communicate that with examples back to CMS. So as we look forward, we certainly are the next 70 that are up for review here, and I think it's going to be interesting to see the impact that the HME community has on the rollout of this or changes to the rollout or lack of rollout. So I think there is still some smoke in that sector. Good news for us in this industry is it's about 20% of market; about 80% is still in private pay and the managed care side.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Do you expect any kind of impact once you it kind of gets up and running here, how are you kind of looking at possible price pressure from it, or anything along those lines?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, in these markets there is always price pressure. If we go back two or three years ago, the big talk was on Oxygen and MedNet cuts. Last year, we had some industry led challenges, this year we've got competitive bidding. In these kind of markets there is always pressure on making sure that you are providing technology at appropriate prices and the government is going to look very closely at those thing. The good new in those circumstances from my viewpoint is that the extent there pricing pressure and again it always is, you want to be the number or number two player, because the scale is important in reducing cost and being able to effectively serve the market place. So I have full expectations that whether it's competitive bidding or some other term in another year, we will still be talking about pricing and we will probably be talking about that adding some item, because its just the nature of any medical device business.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: And then just one follow up kind of the North American market. Do you, I mean do you think that this was kind of a little bit share loss or it's I mean how do you think overall North American market is growing. I know you said worldwide you still think 15% range, it's kind of what we should look forward, but do you think it's any kind of slowdown in bed growth or are they any kind macro factors that are kind of coming into play here.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so I think would you think any global basis. It was somewhere 15% growth and so we feel that really line we grew there. Certainly in the international markets, we feel that we're gaining share. And I'd have to say in the U.S. we on a global basis... on a macros basis, we lost share and I think that was predominantly the pressure that we saw in that low-end flow generator category, where we have yet to release the product with expiratory press release. And in the nasal pillow segment, we've seen some people trying to chip away at our very strong lead there in advance of us releasing new product series. So, I think it was a balance bag for us this quarter and it's one of the things that we are very pleased why we have international business on it. I think as for as bed growth, very hard to say, but I would be surprised if you are going to see substantial bed growth in the near term as people look at that home testing and look at there is a way that they can add capacity, now do I still hear about it? You bet, I mean I heard a group just two days ago, who announced, here in two that they were going to open up several beds. In San Diego they were going to open up several beds. And I know I heard news in different parts of the country. So, I think on the local, I will still see some bed growth. But I think many people are going to look at home testing and see how they can use that, shortly many of the sleep partners we are talking say how are they going to increase the capacity by leveraging home testing in some cost effective manner.
David Clair - Piper Jaffray: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Alexander Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Hi guys, just question on home testing; if CMS... or autosetting devices don't get separate code. Does that home testing really worked then, because how patients going to get titrated in the absence of taking home those devices.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, I think it still works either way to question is... is it as cost effective as it could be and this is probably also going to be a question, if it doesn't get adopted in the first six month, does it get adopted and second month or in the second year, because I think there is going... I find it hard to believe there is not going to be a lot of eyes that are around area and eyes that are looking for where they get benefit in the system... I think it's going to be...
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: If you don't get lot of setting code at home testing and it's really just another screening tool.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think, if you look at some players on the global community and even players in the U.S. community, we have seen where autosets use... are used in a pooled capacity, so sometimes even today, you may see sleep level do titration. They will titrate at a certain level and the DNA will still use an autotritrating device on a patient for two weeks, three weeks, a month, and they will basically use it as titration checker if you will, all right? And then once thing they get that, let's say 95 percentile on our machine, then they still issue a CPAP, but they will do it at a... that they'll do it at a... the pressure that they validated, the pressure that was titrated in a lab. So, there is multiple models that are already in existence and can be viewed. I think what's going to... certainly... by getting the code, what it does is, it narrows the gap for the HME and it just... it is further inducement... further encouragement not to remove the autoset from patient and do a switch over because that cost them money, its time and its risk, anytime you change some of this therapy, if there has been compliance, you are introducing a risk that inevitably is going to cost them more money. So I think what's going to happen is different people are going to experiment just as they already have and have for a number of years, I think it's going to experiment with different process flow. And I think the big determinant of whether they get paid for not maybe the percentage that keep on autoset as opposed to whether they do it at all or not. Does that make sense?
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Yes.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Alexander Smith - JPMorgan: Thanks for that guys.
Operator: And gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joanne.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Gross margin, seem to be hovering around the 60% range. How much of that is being negatively impacted by foreign exchange and how should we think about that guidance forward?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So why don't I push that question over to Brett?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes; thanks, Kieran. So... yes, Joanne on the margin there is kind of two factors working at that, the stronger euro is benefiting the margin and obviously the stronger of the... against the euro is detrimental to it. If you look at in combination, it's pretty much a wash at the moment on the margin line. So, really because the euro, it's tending to offset the dollar impact there.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: And looking forward, I mean are we thinking 60% of the floor on this?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I mean if you look forward, there is... I don't know what's out there. We think around 60% is probably the number obviously there is a lot of impact on that, you'll continue to see pricing pressures and that has been the negative on the margin for a reasonable period of time. But we have had offset in that for example in geographic mix, where international sales have been pretty strong. So, that helps the margin. Product mix also helps. If mask growth is much stronger than flow generator growth, for example that we are experiencing at the moment that would help the margin, clearly when flow generator growth will accelerate that will then tend to put pressure on the margin. So, it's a matter of lying all those up and we are looking in the crystal ball, but there is the factors that have an impact on us and then you really need to make a call on where you think they're heading going forward.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the other aspect is that we've had a very aggressive global supply chain team, particularly on the vendor alliance side, which has been, I think just doing a bang-up job, working with our vendors to reduce supply chain cost, which have been a benefiting near term. I think we are going to see that as we move forward. So we are very actively working throughout the organization in order to maintain margins.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Have you seen any changes in the broader market now that Respironics is part of Philips?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good question, we don't see a lot yet. We remain very positive about fill ups entry in this marketplace. One of the things that are... couple of things we're encouraged about our Philips is knows more to compete through innovations or known more to compete through market expansion. And historically of course that's exactly, where we like to focus and I think that that's good for the long-term health of the industry. Because we all need to be focused on expansion of the market, reaching more patients and we've long known that when we've been the guy doing the heavy lifting that the fast follower strategy of our competitor was a good strategy for them. And I think we are very much looking forward to the awareness that could be built through Philips and their activities in the global basis as well as a focus on innovation. So, no significant near term impact and we still remain positive that it's going to be a good positive long-term impact.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. My final question has to do with the domestic sleep therapy number, hate to harp on this one. But it seems as if it is the low product or low feature product that really ships you up this quarter. And I am curious why the Tango didn't fit that need.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, So, it was two areas, right? So, you are absolutely right. On the flow generator side, it was that lower category. And the issue has to do with that feature set of expiratory press release. The Tango is actually doing its job in sort of that blocking strategy in the low end used where all that is required is a very, very basic machine. So, it's doing it's in that category. What we have seen is that as the expiratory pressure relief type of feature set has moved into the lower end of the instrument side that a lot of volume has moved in that direction and just we've been very frank that we've been hurt on that side by not having a product that has a feature set, and that's exactly why we accelerated the development of the product that we will be able to release later in this quarter.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the questions.
Operator: And gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: : Hi, this is Jamar [ph] for Jason?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Jamar.
Unidentified Analyst: The question I have is on the higher reimbursement for APAP, is there anything anecdotally you could give us from your feedback about the process is going on now and is the timeline still at the first cut towards the end of this month.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I am sorry, Jamar; I missed the beginning part of your question. Can you repeat that?
Unidentified Analyst: Could you just give us any color or any anecdotal evidence you have from the process going on or what the status is?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: On the APAP coding?
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I am sorry; I missed the beginning part of your question. So on the APAP coding, there is really not a lot of color to provide. We submitted a recommendation, I think Dave Pendarvis is on the line now and may want to jump and can give color detail. We've submitted a proposal that we believe should... we thought it was a well written proposal that supported the channel and was sufficient information to say that is both better for patient care and better for the economics of the channel in order to support the use of AutoSet. My understand is that by the end of May or June, we should get some preliminary indications back from CMS and that following that there will be a common period and then the final ruling will fall from that. So, my expectation is within the next several months, we'll get an indication about which way it's going to go although there will be no final decision. Dave, you have anything else there or that?
David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General: No, Kieran; this is Dave. I think you got it right. The timeline is that it should be towards the end of May of that there is public hearing on the matter you typically get a preliminary decision from CMS in advance of that, but then as you indicated there is a period after that and the final decision may not come out until later this year, perhaps late as November of 2009... I am sorry, 2008. If there is a code granted, it wouldn't go into effect until January of 2009. And you really don't get much in the way of anecdotal indications from CMS in advance; obviously, we'll get something in advance, we expect. And then you'd have whatever readings of the tea leaves you can get from the public hearing sort of the end of May, but then you don't get the final decision until later in the year. So, we remain optimistic as Kieran said earlier in the call. It's always hazardous to try to predict what the government is going to do, but we do believe that the use of AutoSet devices, particularly in late of home testing and use for auto titration makes sense for... payers make sense for patients and makes sense for our customers, and we are hopeful that the CMS will see it that way.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. Moving to home sleep testing, have we seen any local coverage decisions yet, and are they so they're following the NCE.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so the water is still flowing under the bridge on that one. We're still waiting to hear the various LCDs and that's going to translate into daily coverage and how it's going to impact the market and all. So, still bit of water to going to the bridge on that. Again, Dave you have any comments?
David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General: No, I think our expectation is that, it will flow through along the lines of the original CMS decision and that the private carriers will fall in line, again it makes fundamentals sense to allow home testing as an adjunct to polysomnography. That way to positions going to make the choice, whatever they think is right and the patients will be allowed to take whatever they think is appropriate. This is to make fundamental sense we expect go forward along that line, but it takes some time to play out.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks so much. [ph]
Operator: And gentlemen the next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please proceed.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Hey guys, congrats on a great quarter and thanks again for taking my question here. Most of my questions have been answered, just some clarification; I know Kieran you mentioned the S8 II Escape with Easy-Breathe at the... sort of low end to get EPR there. I assume that would be part of the full launch with other assay, or should we... the way to think about it is that would be the first one to come out and then sort of the higher end models coming out in quarters to follow.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually, it's actually the opposite; so we are actually right now in the midst of launching the S8 II Vantage and S8 II Elite, and these are the products that we had launched or derivatives of those products that we had launched in other parts of the globe already, so that's what we going to see, when you go to Medtrade, and that's what our sales force has in its bag to sell. The Escape with EPR is not out towards until the end of the quarter and that's the rollout that we expect on the CPAP range of our products.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. So the ones that are out are the APAPs right now? The S8 II Vantage and S8 II Elite are both auto devices, no?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes,so the...you're... absolutely, the Vantage is an auto device absolutely. The Elite is actually a CPAP device that has expiratory pressure relief. That also has the data and efficacy gathering capabilities. So think of it as a data reach CPAP and our APAP. That's our high-end product line. They are both launching with S8 II and the Easy-Breathe technology as we speak. And the EPR, which is a little less feature rich on the data side of the equation will have and it's also less costly is the device that will now have expiratory pressure relief, and that comes out at the end of the quarter.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. And then just along the lines of... I am glad you brought up the data rich device. It's clear that along with the changes here in Medicare that monitoring a patients needs to be stepped up a bit and obviously with your devices having certain advantages over especially low end ones, have you seen a pick up or a higher level of interest in sort of devices that can offer more data?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: That's a great question, and we actually have seen... in our product line, we have seen growth in the high end category. If you aggregate our high-end devices, and that's even taking VPAP auto for the sites, so we are just saying the CPAP, APAP side, we have seen that higher end category grow. Now, whether or not it's growing also in the low end, again we are more in a competitive challenge position, and that's we will find out once we launch the Escape with EPR. So, that's a balanced question, but we are definitely seeing a pick up in those higher-end machines.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. And then just along the line of launch, I am sure obviously people are going to look at the U.S. generator number, I expect good things from the new launch. I am sure you do too or you said. But is there are any sense that why were sales person I knew I had a launch coming up of new products especially the newest ones, latest and greatest et cetera; is there any sense that part of the weakness might have been sort of some waiting for the next one?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's a great question. There is a lot of psychologies that happened at the field level. I have a lot of confidence in our sales reps. I think they are very mature organization and they know that they need to sell what they've got. That being said, is it possible there might have been a little bit of hold of there is a possibility. Was it material, I have nothing that would indicate approve that it was material or not material. I can tell you on the opposite side now that we are providing their bag, these guys are extremely excited. The ability particularly with that Easy-breathe technology, they were able to warm up to it with the VPAP auto. They had a couple of months of selling it. We didn't see the full quarter impact, we had a couple of months, and so they are able to get out to customers; and in essence trial, how are they going to respond to this low noise positioning. How they're going to respond and they've responded extremely well. And of course the customers' first question was always, so tell me, when is this going to come out in CPAP range? You're going to put this in the CPAP range. And so their ability to have a second act only a few months later and be able to put it in the Vantage and put it in the Elite has really got the Sales force energized. In addition to knowing that they have got this Swift LP coming down the line and a recently introduced Mirage Micro. It's been a great psychological booster for us.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. And then just as I always ask, any update on the Sam there?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: On Sam? Oh yes, so the ventilation product range continues to grow. I have been very pleased with the operational efficiency improvement that we've seen in that what we call our Paris range of products. Several of products remain manufactured in Paris itself; we've moved several other of those products over to Sydney. So, it is being received well. We are anticipating though is a series of update for those products, which will be coming out later next year. So, we are not announcing any dates on that et cetera. But we moved the team from simply getting the efficiencies in place and solving some of the... sort of the normal deficit engineering you see in companies when you buy in their early stage. And now they are able to focus to full time attention at the new generations. So, we've got really well energized and quite frankly a well lead team over there.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great, thanks for taking my questions guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet; thanks, Joshua.
Operator: And gentlemen at this time, this will conclude the allotted time slot for the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to management for any closing comments.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everybody's time and attention. I think this was a great quarter for ResMed. It was a quarter that demonstrated and I think reinforced our strategy of internationalization, and we've got a lot of exciting things coming up. So, I look forward to updating you on future quarters. Thanks again for your questions and your interest.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participation in today's conference. This does now conclude your presentation and you may disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2008 ResMed Inc earnings conference call. My name is Akiya and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, the company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as the forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Akiya. As noted, this is Kieran Gallahue, and I will be facilitating these calls on a go-forward basis. Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge our Founder and Executive Chairman, Peter Farrell who has led the organization from its inception and who has presided over these conference calls where he has announced record results for 15 consecutive quarters. That's an amazing result by any measure. And just to put that in perspective, in 1995, we had annual revenues of less than $25 million and today we are reporting revenues in excess of $200 million for a single quarter. I'd also like to remind our investors that Peter hasn't gone anywhere, he remains a very critical part of our strategy development process and of course he is a well-known luminary in the industry. I personally feel very fortunate to have worked with him in these past five years and I very much look forward to working side-by-side with him as we move forward. All right, let's get on to the call. So we are going to structure these calls a bit differently as we move forward. After this initial introduction, I am going to hand the ball off to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer and he is going to review results. At that point, I'll take the ball back and make a few comments putting the quarter into perspective and updating you on key developments and then I will open up the call for your questions. So with that, let me hand it off to Brett. Brett?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Great, thanks Kieran. So, I'll just run through the December quarter results briefly and start from the top. So, revenue for the December quarter was $202.7 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $10 million to our Q2 revenues. Our income from operations was $36.8 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $26.9 million. Our pro forma rate is $0.41 for the quarter. Now this measure excludes restructuring cost, stock-based comp expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. On a GAAP basis, our EPS is $0.34. In terms of overall currency impacts on our results this quarter, the weakening U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01. Gross margin for the quarter was 60%; this is broadly consistent with the September quarter. SG&A for the quarter came in at $67.6 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. If you look at that in constant currency terms, SG&A increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33% this quarter compared to the year ago figure of 32%. R&D expense for the quarter was $14.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Again in constant currency terms, R&D expense was a more modest increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 7%, which is consistent with the year-ago figure. And looking a little forward with ongoing commitment to innovation, total product pipeline and clinical trial commitments, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continue in the 7% to 8% range through the balance of FY '08. Now amortization of acquired intangibles for the quarter was $1.9 million and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.3 million. For the balance of FY '08, we expect that quarterly stock-based comp expense to pick up to around $5.7 million in the third quarter. Now that reflects an up tick, as a result of annual stock option grant in November last year. Turning to revenues in more detail. Overall, the Americas sales were $100.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside of the Americas totaled $102.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. Now our traditional break out of the revenues by product segments. In the Americas, flow generators were 2% lower than the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 12%, reflecting strong sales in our new product introduction. For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 16% over the prior year quarter reflecting momentum in our S8 II sales, while masks and other increased by 31%, again driven by strong new product sales. On a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 19%. Turning now to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations was $18.9 million for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of recall costs, cash flow for the quarter would have been $31.2 million. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21.9 million. This includes $14.2 million in building construction costs, predominantly associated with our San Diego headquarters. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $13.8 million. In terms of balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong. Total assets at December 31, were $1.3 billion, net equity was $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of our external debt were $156 million at the end of December. I'd now like to hand the call back to Kieran for comments.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thanks Brett. All right. I'll make a few comments and what [inaudible] questions that are frequently asked and try to answer those in advance. And then I'll open the call up to more general Q&A. First you can see; we now had our 51st quarter of record results. And those results are in spite of the fact that we had anticipated both Q1 and Q2 of this year to be challenging due to difficult base year comps, GAAP period in our product introductions cycle and the response to earlier price challenges. I should also note that Q2 should be the last quarter where we expect our motor business to negatively impact our Americas growth rate. Q2 represented a few milestones and I'll be remissive if we pass by this call and I didn't note them. This was the first quarter in the company's history that we surpassed $200 million in revenue for a single quarter. And I am very pleased to report that both the Americas and ex-Americas market both contributed over $100 million each, that’s a very nice balance of geographic revenues. All right. Let's transition to talk you about the future and let me say this as a header note. I feel extremely optimistic about this industry as we look forward and I feel just as optimistic about the role that ResMed can play within this industry. And let me tell you why I feel that way. I'm going to cover three basic topics although there're certainly many more that we can go through. I'll talk about our planned, product introductions schedule, a heart failure clinical study that we're initiating and finally the preliminary decision by CMS to allow home sleep testing. First our planned new product introduction schedule. In this quarter, we are launching and in fact in the past few days we've launched two important new products in the Americas. First, the VPAP Auto, which is a bilevel device. The second is the Mirage Micro nasal mask. All right, first on to the VPAP Auto, so what's different about it? First it's our first bilevel product we introduced into the more compact S8 body. It is far smaller than our previous generations bilevel. Second, it will use the same accessory sets such as our S8 humidifier as we use with the more general S8 product line. This helps to provide scale economies for ResMed, while eliminating non-value added changes for our customers reducing their inventory challenges. Third, it's powered by a unique patented double-ended motor, it's the same motor that powers our S8 II CPAPs that we are currently selling outside the Americas. This motor is a core component in our next round of product introduction, because it vastly increases the efficiency of the motor, allowing us to increase performance, while simultaneously reducing noise generated by the device. Because noise is an important factor in user comfort and compliance, we feel this is going to be a very highly valued future of our customers and in fact since it's in the S8 II device that's been launched ex-U.S. we've already being receiving very positive feedback about that. The fourth value proposition for the VPAP Auto is the integration of our unique Easy-Breathe waveform and you will be hearing a lot more about the Easy-Breathe waveform in the coming months. The Easy-Breathe waveform is an extremely comfortable flow pattern that once again improves user comfort and as we know that's a major factor in driving compliance. So, we are very optimistic about the launch of the VPAP Auto, given the timing of the release we should see some of the impact in Q3 although it's going to be a partial impact in this quarter and more full impact in Q4. Second product we’ve introduced within the past few days is the Mirage Micro Mask, and this is our first product introduction into the standard nasal mask category in four years. Just as the quadro set of new standard for a full-face mask performance, we believe the Mirage Micro will set a new standard for comfort, ease of fitting and performance within the standard nasal mask category. As we look to Q4, we should have a full quarter of impact both from the Mirage Micro and the VPAP Auto and then we are going to introduce another series of products during the fourth quarter. Let me go through those for just a minute. On the CPAP side, we will be introducing several of the S8 II product series in to market, in the Americas that we've already launched during Q2 in Europe or outside the Americas. Once again, the products will be powered by our unique double-ended motor technology that has allowed us to improve performance and at the same time lowering noise levels. Just like the VPAP Auto, we will retain the current S8 design and accessories in order to minimize transition challenges for our customers while maintaining our on supply chain scale efficiencies. Finally, we expect to be introducing of new mask product into the nasal pillows category also during Q4 and we will provide more detail on that product as the product launches. So as you can see, we've got a fantastic new product flow over next five months or so and it is a... it is a product line that is built up with innovative technologies, but is also consistent with our strategy of maintaining efficiencies with the customer in our own supply chain. All right, next I would like to address the industry drivers and first, let's talk about congestive heart failure. In January this year, we have begun the recruitment of our first patients into the predominantly European-based clinical study in heart failure. We've long noted the critical role of the treatment of SDB can have on very serious and very costly co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure, such as diabetes, hypertension and others. This study represents a very tangible stake in the ground of our commitment to both providing and generating value from the these co-morbidities. This study, which is intended to be conducted over a five or so year time frame is targeted to the use of adaptive servo-ventilation and very specifically to the use of the ResMed ACS2 product in severe heart failure patients. The primary end points measured by the end points, which are meaningful to the heart failure and to the payer communities, mortality and hospitalizations. The study will engage two primary critical medical specialties, cardiologists and respirologists or pulmonologists. Heart failure costs government billions of dollars per annum to treat and we're optimistic that the use of ResMed's adaptive servo-ventilation, very specifically the ACS2 products will provide clinical benefits but positive economic benefits. While we don't intend to report specifically on the study as it progresses, we'll provide updates as material information or results become available. Finally, let me briefly comment on the preliminary national coverage decision that CMS in December. First of all let me highlight that this decision is preliminary and a final decision is due out in mid March of this year. Now, our reading in the preliminary decision is that CMS has recognized that SVD is an enormous public health issue and they're seeking to increase the access to diagnose this in treatment of the 90% of the patients who have not yet been diagnosed or treated. We also see the decision as an indication that home testing will be complimentary to the current diagnostic pathway and we're hopeful and confident that our valued partners in the sleep community will continue to play a pivotal role in treating patients and we plan to support our partners as they evolve and thrive in this new environment. From the perspective of impact on the SVD device community, this represents an additional driver for growth over the long haul, and one more reason for us to believe that the industry continues to have bright prospects. We remain in an industry that is 90% unpenetrated and achieving sustainable industry growth in the 15% to 20% range is supported by these types of drivers. Now, importantly, there's some water to flow under the bridge before this decision is finalized, and before we feel its full impact in the industry. In general, medical community takes a bit of time to absorb change and it wouldn't be surprising to us if it is 18 months to 24 months to pass before this thing sorts itself out. Nonetheless, it remains a very positive change for the industry and one that we look forward to supporting. So in summary, we're very optimistic about the future of the industry and the role that ResMed can play in our industry's growth and we're looking forward to the positive forward momentum that we'll see not only from our new product introductions that we'll be seeing over the next five months, but also these positive developments in the industry as a whole. All right, with that why don't I take a break and turn it over to Q&A. Akiya? Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable of Natixis. Please proceed.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call here. Peter, I take this opportunity to thank you for all your help over the years and Kieran I guess you obviously been around for a while, but a formal welcome to the party here. Just obviously kind of the main... probably the big question that sticks out is the flow generators in the Americas. Can you just comment, I mean everything else looks great. Maybe that's a function in the motor business. Just if you can give us a little commentary on that.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I mean, I'll let Keith to handle part of it, let me just open it up. We're basically a gap period here. We've had some very difficult base year comparables that we are dealing with and it sort of peaks out in Q2, we have got the new product introductions that will be in the flow generator side, that will be coming forth, not only the VPAP Auto here in Q3, but also we are going to see in Q4 and quite frankly there is also a bit of pricing impact that was in those numbers as well. So little bit lower than we are used to, that's for sure. But again, we've got confidence as we move forward that will be flowing out of that. Keith, you got anything to add to that?
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: Kieran I think that that is a pretty adequate job of going through the explanation, the only... but the only thing that I would add is that we’ve also had some growth in our sales force over the course of the last year or so and as a result of that growth, we've had some promotions within the sales force, we've expanded some territories and added some new territories. Well, one of the things that we found is that it takes our reps about six months to really begin to ramp up to a level of productivity once they come on board, and fortunately we are at the point where those reps, those new reps that we've added are now clearing that six month productivity and moving towards nine months. So with the refreshing of the product line which gives us an opportunity to really get the sales force excited about what they are selling and the combination of the reps becoming more mature in what they are doing, I think that that's something we look forward to.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. And then just a follow-up, can you guys just talk about the sort of overall health of the market here. I know you sort of alluded to it but obviously just obviously with you and Respironics out there and I guess as it relates to may be home diagnostics, are we expecting sort of some change here with people kind of ready, maybe holding back as things get, and then obviously expect a pick up when it sort of goes full swing?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So... I think periods of changes there is always short-term opportunity for people to sort of look and question what their role is, but the general signals in the market is positive one at this point. I think that the home… the preliminary decision on home testing certainly is one that bodes extremely well for the long-term access of the patients for the diagnostics process and removes some of the bricks and mortars limitations that may have been governor on growth as we've seen in the past. So near term, there is certainly going to be some jockeying for position out there, as various members of the medical community determine what the role is that they are going to play in this new world going forward. But I suspect that we'll yield some more positive contribution versus negative side. I think the changes are good.
Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder: Great. Well thanks a lot. Great job guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills of Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Thank you and how are you. Wanted to follow-up Kieran if I can on the last question or the last answer about some of the constituents within the supply chain here are jockeying for positions, I'm trying to figure out how they could fit in. Could you elaborate on that a bit further, specifically it seems that we are seeing growth in the number of beds which is an underlying variable that is important for growth in the underlying market. However may be not as robust as you've seen in years past and perhaps that is because folks in the supply chain are trying to figure out what is going... what the markets or what the environment is going to look like after the final decision. Could you help us understand what you see in terms of growth in the number of sleep labs currently and how you think that will change as folks sort of figure out how... where they fit in?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So part of this is... information we have directed sort of detail or data, and part of it's going to be more just looking at the market and we are providing--.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Sure.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: But, we're seeing continued growth on the sleep lab PSG, capacity side but let's face it, if we are looking for the real growth in the capacity that's going to be this home testing as it comes through, because then it moves well beyond the bricks and mortars and we're all going to have a look at a different indicators of growth as we move forward. And as far as I'm concerned that’s a very positive thing, right because it demonstrates that there is going to be more ways of growing capacity. It's good to see that sleep labs continue to expand some of their capacity because we feel [inaudible] important role within… in this… in the diagnostic process. There were to be a certain amount of the patients that will be able to be fully tested and diagnosed with home testing and there will be a certain amount of those patients which are going to need more comprehensive care, such as those, let's say in complex sleep apnea that are going to need the help and support of that in the lab diagnostic process. So we are pleased to see that they'll continue to do that. So in general... again I guess I can only say that there are various players who have spoke up that are waiting for the final decision, but are looking to get in the gap to actively engage. There is some members in the sleep community, they feel they can play a very important role as part of the hub-and-spoke model of engaging other specialists and primary care physicians. You’ve heard public statements from home medical equipment providers, who feel that they can provide a role in helping to accelerate the diagnostics rate by getting engaged in home testing. I suspect that there will be other players that will get involved in that as well. So from our view is we try to borrow [ph] that down and say what does that mean from an industry perspective, and I got it clear everything that we are seeing in that is extremely positive, it means that there is going to be more awareness building that there will be more interested parties in various stages of the market that will be looking to try to take those 90% of the patients who remain undiagnosed, and try to find a complimentary path way to help them reach therapy.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Great, that's very helpful, just two quick follow-ups here, I don’t if they are quick, but I'll try to make them quick. So I understand how that would impact positively perhaps longer term, near term… perhaps some of an impact that we won't see the final decision until March. So from what you've laid out we have this environment for you, we have new products and easier year-over-year comparisons and perhaps still some jockeying for physician as a modest option. So, with that said as we look into the near term to the second half of your fiscal year, could you helps a little bit with respect to your expectations for the growth, especially in our U.S. business but also the ability to maintain the growth you put up this quarter in the international business given what's lying in front of you for the next couple of quarters?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So obviously the… anything to do with the home testing, actually one point of clarification before I start, when I say the jockeying for position I mean that's our positive side, I don't know that's an offset at this point so.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: But if we go to the next stage, obviously in the international side they are not going to be influence or impacted by the home testing, really what’s driving that is positive introduction of the SA-2 it's been a very well received product into that market, as well as some of the new mass products, as well as quite frankly execution. We have been improving in many areas of the world, we’ve been improving our execution, so I feel very good about that piece, obviously the piece that’s influence by currency is lot [ph]. But, as far as the execution the basic fundamentals of the business I feel very good about the way that the team is performing and the basic stable of products that we have. On the America side as we move forward we've been stating here for quite a number of quarters is that, we felt that Q1 and Q2 were going to be difficult because of the product gaps and some of the base year comps and sort of absorbing some of the pricing channels. And then as we move through Q3 and Q4, we are beginning to get into that product flow in Q3 and a bit more product flow in Q4, and we have proved... we expect that we will begin climbing back during that period back to market rates of growth. So, we continue to feel comfortable with that assessment.
Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams: Great. And then last question, I will get back in queue, regarding gross margins. I mean, just sort of in plain speak here, have we seen the trough in gross margins? I think 60% was kind of a line that most of us wanted to see sort of stabilize that and can we see expansion from here giving clearly a lot of what you have talked about with respect to the new product suggest efficiencies are being worked into the manufacturing facilities, and I guess it speaks to how can that sort of be a greater influence to your gross margins relative to the price pressure you have seen in with respective ladder. Do we expect to see that abate a bit as Respironics becomes part of a larger organization that probably is more interested in sales… interested in running a profitable business.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think you have got a short-term element to that question, you have longer-term element of that question, and would I be looking for margin expansion in the next few quarters? No, I think that will be difficult to look for. One of the very comforting things of this market is that many of the pricing pressures that we talked about six months ago, nine months ago, it seems that there has been a floor established in the market. We are not seeing price levels drop below where we had seen some of the deals, six and nine months ago. On the flip side of that, you do have obviously more customers as we have said it is going to happen here, more customers who are getting this price level. So what you are going to see externally during that time period is a bit continued pressure on ASPs here over the next few quarters, but again the good news is we are not seeing... it is simply an expansion to more customers. That's a very classic way of what happens in price in this market. So, a lot of the gross margin improvements that... and some of the fundamental drivers that we would see really come with significant changes in the product evolution, and that we would see in sort of next generations of product and some of the changes that we are working on behind the seasons in the supply chain. So near-term, would I be looking for expansion? No. Are we fundamentally doing the right things to continue to reduce our cost of goods over the longer haul, absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wachovia. Please proceed.
Michael Matson - Wachovia: Sure. I guess, just wanted to ask you again a little bit about your confidence level in a rebound, I mean the comps obviously do get easier, but the growth in the US does seem to have slowed pretty substantially and the numbers that are out there show, I mean the consensus estimate shows a fair bit of acceleration in the next couple of quarters. Are you comfortable with those?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I don't comment on any specific sort of numbers that are out there, but let me talk a little bit more in general, Michael. So, again these first couple of quarters, we did have very difficult base year comps, and we in a gap in the product flow etc. As we move into the Q3 and Q4, again we are climbing back towards market levels of growth. So, do I feel comfortable with that? Yes, I do feel comfortable that we can climb back towards those levels. I am not here saying that we are going to get back to where we were a year and half ago at 45% and 50% growth levels. I don't think that would be reasonable to assume, but I do think that we have some very good positive momentum to get back to market levels to grow.
Michael Matson - Wachovia: Okay and then, I was wondering if your growth... are you going to do anything to try to rein in the SG&A and R&D levels, given further growth in those expenditures, given the slowing revenue growth that we are seeing, because they... they were growing a little faster, I think in your overall revenue growth in the quarter, I realized some of that might have due to currency?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, big part of it was due to currency, I think Brett had given the breakout on… for instance on R&D and the growth in constant currency and we're substantially lower. At this point, feel very comfortable particularly in R&D line with the amount of investment that we are providing into the business and, when you are in a market that’s 90% untapped, our view is this is not the time to take your foot of the accelerator. So we are doing the smart things I think in the sense that as the currency is going a bit against us, we have slowed constant currency growth of those, but we are going to starve the business. We simply… this is simply the wrong phase of this industry's growth. And particularly, when you look at all the good things that are happening whether it is the… the home testing decision that we are looking forward to in March, already we talk about some of the data that's coming out in the co-morbidity, be it congestive heart failure, the study I think is going to be very important over the long haul both the payers as well as to the clinical community, and in areas such as diabetes and occupational health there are so many aspects in this market that are untapped, that our job is to keep this market growing and to participate more than our fair share in that growth and so, I think now is the wrong time for us to look at any substantial leverage of that.
Michael Matson - Wachovia: All right, and then I guess just two product related questions on some of your recently introduced products, I guess not that recent, but the Adapt SV and then the Tango kind of at the low and high end of the markets, just any updates you can gives us there on the progress with those products?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes both are playing their role, the Adapt SV remains, and remember the Adapt SV is also known as the ACS 2 in Europe, so it remains a core element of our strategic growth as we move forward and it is the basis of this congestive heart failure study. So we continue to gain traction in the understanding awareness of complex sleep apnea and we continue to focus on the significant role that a complaint [ph] congestive heart failure outside the U.S. As far as the Tango, I remember is really two different parts to the strategy behind Tango, on one side it was basically to pick up some great, it was… we haven't traditionally participated in that very low-end part of the market. And the idea was when you are on a sales call and they are buying those low end, let's participate, we are doing okay in that area, that is not really our core skill set, we tend to sell higher technology, we tend to sell algorithms that make a difference and focus on other aspects of the sales process. So I'll say that we are doing all right, we are certainly not hitting out of the park with the part of it. The other part of the Tango of course was more of a, sort of strategic blocking strategy overtime. And not for any particular competitor or any particular risk on the horizon, but we got a nice market here and one other things that we look to do is to create barriers to entry over time, and if you look at the most rational place that a competitor might try to enter the market it would be where the intellectual property barriers and the technology barriers low switches, the low end CPAP and it has done an effective job I think in that side of the market, which is to create a bit of block.
Michael Matson - Wachovia: All rights that's all I've got thanks.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great for asking the questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Lee of Caris & Company. Please proceed.
Timothy Lee - Caris & Company: Hi. Good afternoon. Kieran, can you just give us your thoughts on how do you think the market dynamics may change here with Respironics in the hands of the Philips, I mean do you think we are ahead into a era of greater pricing stability and… Keith it will get as well I guess given his experience with Philips as a part of heart chain [ph]?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. That will be great. So in... obviously the waters got to flow under the bridge here. So, we're sitting here trying to predict the future. But, I can tell you that my view on the acquisitions is I'm very positive on it, I think it's great. And I think in a lot of ways it's great validation of the growth prospects in this industry, I think it's recognition of this industry being highly under penetrated and I think, having a large well known brand entering the marketplace should help us in creating awareness within the industry and creating awareness within the various medical cilo [ph]. So, I'm very positive and very optimistic about the future and Philips’ entry into the marketplace. As far as pricing, we will have to see how that flows. I encouraged to note the reputation of their company is usually to sell on value on a market expansion and value being bringing new and innovative ideas to the marketplace. That's the kind of market that we think is appropriate, again for such an under penetrated market. So my view is that it's a positive development and I am looking forward to working with them in market expansion and obviously competing with them in the appropriate manner. Keith, you have anything to add to that?
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: Kieran, I would just say that I agree with you 100% on the perspective that Philips sells on the basis of value, they also have a history of growing markets, which is one of the things that lot of us are very excited about. We... ResMed has spent a lot of time growing individual market segments. Respironics has spent a lot time as a close follower. We view Philips as a company that will invest in the market growth and put as much time into the development driving, more people into the diagnostic channel and the therapeutic channel as we are. So, we are very excited about this.
Timothy Lee - Caris & Company: One last if I may just, can you give us your current thoughts on how you think competitive bidding is going to play out in the marketplace?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again, water is got to flow under the bridge there. We will wait to see what the... how the results pan out there and you know what bids are accepted and what not. We hear mixed things from the marketplace. As with anything before the final pronouncements, you get plenty of rumors running around. And the good thing here is that, you know, CMS was running a bit higher on the pricing than you'll see at most managed care and other payers, so there's room to move on that to start with. And from our perspective, it's 10% of our global sales 20% of our U.S. sales and so we think we are still well positioned to compete there. But, it's not a direct impact on us, it's an indirect impact.
Timothy Lee - Caris & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair please proceed.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Good afternoon Kieran.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good afternoon.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Just few things I wanted to follow-up on. First, if you look at the U.S. generator growth versus the international and you normalize for currency, what's your sense about how important the driver the new generators have been on the constant currency generator growth overseas and should we see that really kicking in quickly here in the third fiscal quarter with the new product?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes great question. So you know the... a large part of the S8 II impact has not even really been felt in the ex-U.S. market. It was launched during the quarter and so you have the product introduction time and depending on what market you are in, you either see a delayed impact or you see it more similar to what you see in the Americas. France would be an example of where you see it more quickly. Germany would be an example of where there's a multi-month delayed impact on that. So, what I can speak to is all leading indicators and the signals and the feedback we've had from market and I got to tell that people are responding very well. And the thing that they seem to be keen on is the difference in this motor technology. I... they are getting the concept, that is like changing the engine in your car and it is very different, I mean it is much more efficient the... motor spins at a slower rate and yet it gives higher performance and that all leads to a major issue in this market place which is how do you reduce noise, and so it provides wins in each of those segments. So, all the indicators that we had out of the ex-US market place today have been extremely positive. And I think it will have a very positive impact on our ability to sell in the Americans, to be able to not inconvenience our customers by making them change their accessories and what not, and yet giving them a whole new engine to the car. So, its ... I think the signals [ph] are good.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: So, if you look at the US generator growth and what is really going on here, you were down 7%, what's mix? I mean, what is price and then what's units? Are units down, you know, units flat and prices down $10.15 [ph], what's going on?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think when we are down, we are down about 2% in the flow generator right?
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Excuse me, I am sorry, I was thinking on the plus 7 on the total, so minus two, but what is going on there?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Right, so it is a little bit of both. Clearly you had some, some price in that, but for the most part I still have to say that flow generator on a volume basis is flat, so it may not have gone backwards, but it's flat. And part of that is the various elements that I noted earlier, I mean part of that to difficult base... part of that is the product gap. We were sort of in anticipation of these changes to the S8, where we can introduce some new feature sets and introduce some new value props, and some of that is, some of the are points that the Keith has noted, but--.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, okay.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: But I don’t know, Keith do you have anything to add to that?
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: I would just say that, when you look at the S81, it is a product platform that is 10 or 11 quarters old and our competitor has had a ref... a new product introduction during that period of time, the momentum swung in their direction, the S82 with the new motor and the, and the noise factor and the easy breath capability is something around our organization is looking for very strongly to bring significant life into what we were doing. It is… for intends and purposes we will view it as a new product introduction and we are very exited about it, it depend and will swing back.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, and so then just kind of finishing up on the generator side..
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: But then, let me interrupt you for a second, because I don’t think Kieran caught this in his response back to you, you asked specifically about Q3, that product will be introduced into the US at the beginning of Q4.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: All right, yes you got that… but you got the S8 platforms for the VPAP and there is… it may help a little bit I guess.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Exactly.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, so if you think...
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: Partial quarter impact.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Sure. So if you think about though the impact of the Adapt SV, I mean this a very high dollar price system. What sort of impact is that having? Is that $5 million product a quarter at this point and is that keeping the core generator business from being down 5 or 10 on a unit basis, or is this all generally flattish?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: W haven't broken out that, that piece in the past and so I… I don’t feel comfortable at this point going below that on sort of the mix analysis, but in general I think it's fair to say that, that when you look at the materiality of the impact, the flow generators is flat to down a little bit, and I think that’s… it is a fair assessment and a conclusion to walk away with them.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay, and just one quick question for Brett if you are still around. The tax rate in the quarter, can you kind of walk me through what's going on there and what we should expect for the balance of the year please?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, hi Ben. So, the tax rate for this quarter was 30.9% the effective tax rate, which is pretty similar to Q1. I expect the balance of FY '08, it will be around that level as well.
Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company: Okay. So no changes there and then finally on CapEx, you obviously see the impacts of the facility build out in San Diego. What's your thought on that and how long that's going to run at kind of a higher level, and is there any additional CapEx for facilities expected beyond that new facility?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: No, so we're pretty much through, we had some extension for the manufacturing facility down here in Sydney, which was completed in December, so that's pretty much through there. So, now we've got the county Mysore [ph] facility that’s been constructed, it is due to finish around March 2009, and roughly [inaudible] a quarter on CapEx for that facility.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Thank you, Brett may be some housekeeping questions with respect to currency, can you, first give us what your FX assumptions are for the, in terms of the total impact for the rest of this year?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: If I could tell you what the currency is going to do, I could probably do that but I think, I mean you just don't know where we're going to go with currency particularly at the moment where it's pretty volatile. But clearly we have some hedging in place, which mitigates to some extent. I think, and I am looking at... I don't think we're going to get a perishable movements out of next year for a while in the Euro or the all the end. When you look at how various analyst predictions, some are up and some are down. So I think we just continue to manage as we've done and in terms of the impact though if you're looking at, there was one thing this quarter what might be in the next few quarters. Suppose if the currencies wash through you probably looking at the sort of impact over the next few quarters, barring any major movements in the currency.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Great very good. So then in terms of, as we think of margins impact over the quarter here, we should think of the gross margin perhaps being relatively flat with the room for potential little bit of improvement [inaudible] is that the correct way of thinking about it?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I mean, not too much more add that Kieran said at the moment it is around 60% in the short term we likely get any expansion on that, probably not. But if you look at September to December that margin was around the sort of 60% mark with the whole various factors, obviously some mix in our performance in March generally speaking would mean that you'd get some benefit on the margin.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Pretty good and then one question, I'll put it either Kieran or Keith, in terms of the S8 recall, can give us some update please on what you stand on that in terms of completion and remediating it and how long do you expect will take complete please.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll throw that to Keith.
Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas: So we believe that… well first of all there is two different ways to break that down one is the world… the ROW recall which I think that this point is pretty well on it, pretty much on suite to total completion. In the U.S. we believe that we are about 70% completed with this, we believe that we are at the point where there is no further distraction to the sales force or very minimal going forward. But we also believe that they will be in this for another probably one to two quarters, which is what we had anticipated when the first announced the recall.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith of JPMorgan, please proceed.
Alex Smith - JPMorgan: Hi, guys. Just a question on the heart failure trails. How much is that going to cost in terms of financing and can you give us some... are going to be trying for that or someone else.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, we will be funding it, and Brett you want to go through the estimates?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So it will be... looking at the study it will be ... it's around 4 years to 5 years 4.5 years with the total cost of between $10 million and $12 million over that period of time. Spread reasonably evenly, but you might get little bit of a kick up in FY ‘09 on that study. But in terms of the total funding it's around that $10 million to $12 million over that period. To the extent, we will have quickly that... we go through that spending depends on how quickly you recruit through the clinical trial and so on. But in terms of overall ballpark figures that's what we're talking about.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, let me just...
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: In fact in addition to the 7% or so as you spend on R&D or part of that on going commitment?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: That will be part of the on going commitment we think we'll run around the 7% to 8% including funding that trial.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Okay. And I guess another question is obviously with that home testing the roll of auto setting devices becomes a bit more important in terms of setting the pressures in the home. Kieran, do you think that we could see a mix shift towards IPAPs as the CMS ruling does come through pretty much as the proposal?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I think, again I think we have to wait for… see how the proposals pull through the finish line here. But certainly you would think it would open the opportunity for the additional use of auto setting technologies. There is the whole question of how the titration event occurs at home if the diagnostic process happens at home. One of the great benefits of auto setting technology is that it adjusts night-by-night, day-by-day over the entire time period of the individual user. So, it is absolutely perfectly tailored to those types of opportunities and I should note that, we did not waste any time... as soon as preliminary decision came out within a couples of weeks we were back as we have before. We're trying to take advantage to see if we can get increased compensation, and increased reimbursement for our customer to be able to supply those auto-setting devices. So it is long shot, I wouldn’t necessary model in success at this point, but I think it that… there was a very good economic rationale for the increased use of auto setting, it's going to simplify the process, it's going to improve patient care, it's going to reduce the expense of the HMEs in handling these patients. But I think they need be to appropriate compensated. So we're going to drive on that. Just one more on, by the way on the congestive heart side, I don't pass by that question without noting. This is a very significant event for us, I think in putting a stake in the ground of congestive heart failure. We've talked quite a bit about the co-morbidities and we've taken some significant actions over time. But, this is a very interesting pivotal study that should help demonstrate benefits in both mortality and hospitalization and that's an important aspect in the health economics and the continued reimbursement in this area. So, it's a very important role and leadership role that we're taking in this market. And in addition, there is a side benefit, what you're doing there, is you're the increasing the awareness and the understanding of the role that adaptive servo-ventilation plays within the heart failure community and we look forward to generating benefit during the life of that study. So, it's a very important study from multiple aspects.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Kieran you mentioned that you've basically applying to get a new for an IPAP, how long do you think that process might take?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Why don’t I throw that over to David Pendarvis who leads many of our efforts in that area.
David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General Counsel: As you know, we’ve gone through this code this the past and haven't received it. So as Kieran said, we don't want everybody immediately model in, increase reimbursement for our automatic device, but that would come up during the first half of calendar '08 and again that's at the CMS level. So, as with all of these things both home testing and any increased reimbursement, that impacts the U.S. Medicare reimbursement first and anything that would happen positively would take a while to roll through the commercial payers throughout the rest of the US. So, we look forward if we got something positive, we would hope to see it answer in the first half of the year.
Alex Smith – JPMorgan: Thanks very much guys.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Hi, thank you for taking the question. You told us that FX was a negative penny contributor to EPS. What was the impact of the top line?
Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer: Hi Joanne it is Brett. Yes, on the top line, we had favorable currency movements at around $10 million to the revenue number.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. How many patients are you going to be having in your congestive heart failure trial?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: The objective is 1200 patients. So, it's quite a sizable study, particularly for this industry it's certainly the largest study of its nature.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: And on previous conference you have talked about the OSI market growing 15% to 20% and your goal or wasn't a goal because I know guys don’t give guidance. But would be around getting to sort of within that range for '08. What are you currently thinking?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, we historically said that we believe the ex-US market growth is about 10% to 15% per annum and that the Americas market, where we expect to grow at 15% to 20% per annum as an average basis. And so, when you blend those things together, you're somewhere around that 15% plus range. So, we continue to feel comfortable that in the long range that that's the growth prospects of the industry, certainly there will be sometimes when it is a little bit above and little bit below that and we've seen that over the past x number of years. And I'll just say again, I'm just extremely comfortable and pleased with some of the signals for the long-term health and growth in this marketplace, particularly with the home testing.
Joanne Wuensch – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. But am trying to get the arms around... a couple of other people are trying to do... It sounds like if...are we at a trough, do you move out of it and what is your pace of moving out of it? I know comps getting easier, I know you've got new products, I know you don't like to give guidance. Can you just start to put some gate on some numbers though?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Well, Again I think we'll continue to try to give you the directional piece of it we been giving. Do we think we've troughed [ph] in the America side of this, yes I think we have, and we expect to be pulling out of that. As we go through Q3 and Q4, we've got a partial impact to some new products in Q3, we've got some partial impact of other new products in Q4 and some of that get the full balance. So, our objective is to start to get back towards market rates of growth as we get towards the end of this fiscal year and then take it for there into the next year. So, to answer you directly do we feel like we've troughed in the Americas, yes that's certainly our expectation.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of UBS. Please proceed.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Thanks very much Kieran. And congratulations in taking out the roll there. Just, I guess just thinking, I guess did node the head with home diagnosis, obviously a potential power driver for the industry. We are sort of hearing, I guess some mechanizing of home healthcare dealers and so on putting plants in place. Could you give us some indication of sort of what steps you might be taking over the sort of next 6 to 12 months and whether there is any cost involved. Just to I guess align yourself to sort of take advantage?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, so I think that will become more and more clear as we get to a final decision and we understand what's in and what's out, right in there is...
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Yes.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Slight variables in this decision. Type 3, Type 4 devices who are... is going to be able to be involved in the process with the titration penetration process that is going to be acceptable how that going to be reimbursed. So there is some pieces in here that can influence the role that we can play and who will be addressing that. So at this point, I don't anticipate that we have certainly any increased expenditures to support that, and if an opportunity arises and we think that we can see a way of stimulating growth extremely quickly, would we jump on it, you bet. Is that immediately obvious at this point? No its not, I think at this point we and others have... already have technologies, so we've got the ApneaLink which is a very unique device and very powerful device that will certainly satisfy the requirements for the Type 4. There are others that have that and there is a number of suppliers in Type 3, which is good, because that indicates that there is number of players that from an industry perspective can supply devices that can get these devices in the hands to those who need to use them and our intention is to work with our partners that we work with through for quite sometimes support sweet communities as they evolve through this process and most importantly to support the patient outcomes, how can we help them drive to access for more patients. So at this point, again the short answer to your question, we are looking for some significant expenditures in support of this, I don't see that at this point.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: It sounds like next quarter question bit more details with the decision but, perhaps a quick follow on just actually Germany had been weak in previous quarters obviously could read down rest of all with currency. Could you perhaps just sort of outline were Germany is out at the moment, maybe any [inaudible]?
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, yes so Germany as a results perspective continues to be relatively flat, that being said I think we are making very significant progress in a lot of aspects of the German organization in the German market. The new management team has been there for about a year, they took a bit of timing, see underneath them and they have made some very positive changes. The thing to remember is that the German marketplace we're home medical equipment provider and so when we make changes there is this process… for instance with the S8 II, you put the S8 II out there, you need to get out last, then there is a, often a three-month period were you have introduction not only to the physicians but then there is trial periods for the patients. Then there prescription is written and then we have to chase down the payment on that prescription over another 90 days. So as a result, when you start seeing some positive indicators, you start seeing the flow through a little bit later and then in addition to that course you have deferred revenue etcetera, I mean the service contracts. So Germany, we tend to look for the sort of positive signals of improvement such as in prescription rates or other aspects of the market and we've started to see that. So I'm comfortable that Germany is beginning the slow road back to recovery and it seems in good shape. What that does indicate is that other parts of ex-Americas are doing quite well, we've got A-Pac [ph] that’s doing quite well. We have other countries within Europe, such as France and the UK that are really hitting the ball out of the park and that's both because of the product stream and because of a fundamental execution. So, it's a mix bag and... but the mixed bag is for the most part... Germany still serving that flat range, but signals of improvement, but other than that very, very good progress.
Andrew Goodsall – UBS: Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that is all the questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran Gallahue. Please proceed.
Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. I appreciate the interest and then the questions. As you can see we did have some challenges in Q2 and particularly some challenges in Americas, but I would like to leave the call with a highlight that I am feeling very optimistic about where this market can head in long term. We have some very good short-term signals, and if you look at our product flow over the coming five to six months we are very encouraged by what it's going to mean to the organization and what it's going to mean to the sleep community [ph]. So I look forward to updating you on future calls and demonstrating our progress. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great evening.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the company has asked me to address certain matters.First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of thisconference call for any purpose. Second, during the call ResMed may makeforward-looking statements such as projections of the future revenue orearnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products.  These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist thatcould cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-lookingstatements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would like it turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell,ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead. 
Peter Farrell: Thank you, Jeremy, very much. Let me start straight into it. Revenue for thequarter was $185.7 million, around $186 million, an increase of 14% over theyear ago quarter. Pro forma income from operations was $40.4 million, and proforma net income was $30.6 million.  Pro forma diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39, an increase of 5% comparedto the '06 September quarter. GAAP operating income was $31.8 million for thequarter, while net income was $24.1 or $0.31 per diluted share. GAAP grossmargin was $60.2 for the quarter ended September 30, '07.  Let me note that the closing price on the U.S. dollar to the Aussie was$0.75 a year ago quarter and this quarter was $0.89, so there was a 19%increase due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and that's basicallyunprecedented. If we run that through EPS, it’s about $0.0125. So that is apretty big hit.  Pro forma SG&A for the quarter was $59 million, an increase of $8.5million or 17%. Pro forma SG&A costs were 32% of revenue for this quarterjust ended, compared to 31% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP SG&A was$62.9 million, 18% up, and in constant currency terms pro forma SG&A costsincreased by 11% compared to the same period a year ago.  Again, we were a hit by the depreciating U.S. dollar, which flowed throughto, as I already mentioned to EPS, and we're looking at 11% constant currencyversus the actual number of 18%. So that's quite a hit.  Pro forma R&D expenditure was $12.6 million, 7% of revenues. GAAPvirtually the same, $13 million, again 7% of revenues and this increased 20%over the year ago quarter and again U.S. depreciation, U.S. dollar depreciationwas a significant contributor to the 20% R&D expense and in constantcurrency was actually 9%.  Amortization of acquired intangibles, $1.8 million, $1.2 net of tax and theamortization of assets was associated with various acquisitions. Stock basedcompensation during the quarter was as expected, $4.5 million, $3.4 million netof tax. Restructuring, there was a restructuring cost for a Baseloffice downsizing, $2.3 million. And as noted there is another $200,000, whichwill hit the quarter that we're currently in. Inventory $167 million, increasedby $9.9 million, and DSO’s at 79 days were essentially consistent with the JuneDSO’s.  In the first quarter of the fiscal year '08, overall American sales were up9%, but actually 11% when we take into account the motor division sales orexcluding those. And parenthetically let me note that was around $300,000, inthe year ago quarter it was $2.1 million.  So, there was a loss there of $1.8 million and going forward the comparablesare going to be a little more favorable to us. Sales outside of the Americas,$88.1 million, an encouraging 19% increase year-over-year, and operating cashflow for the quarter just ended the September quarter, $28.1 million and that'sfairly encouraging, that compares with a net income of $24.1 million.  A couple of comments, the new full face mask offerings, the Quattro and theLiberty, are going extremely well. They're excellent products and in our viewmore than competitive and allows us to keep a price differential.  We're also excited about the launch of our new S8, an extremely quiet S8 IIflow generator. It has been launched in Asia Pac and selected European markets,in particular Germany.We have incorporated in this our Easy-Breathe technology, really improved motorcharacteristics and if one combines the Swift II with the S8 II, the Whisper,it is the quietest CPAP on the market, and in fact the S8 II has a noise levelof around 23 decibels, which is basically below our ability to hear.  In fact, we had reports back from some customers saying that they had toactually touch the device to make sure it was actually operating, and there isnot much vibration there, either. So we remain very confident about marketfundamentals and we have some new products on the horizon. And we're hopeful aswe move forward in fiscal '08, Q3, Q4, we're hopeful of achieving our moreusual growth pattern for the people that have been expecting over the pastdecade or so.  I will also note finally, that we have an extremely strong balance sheet,cash, cash equivalents, $278 million and our retained earnings are gettingclose to $0.5 billion are actually a shade over $460, but very close to $0.5billion in retained earnings. So, we have a very strong balance sheet, whichgives us flexibility.  So now let me throw it open to Q&A. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Choiwith Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon, Peter.
Peter Farrell: Paul, how are you?
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Fine, thank you. Let me first say congratulations to you and also to Kieranon the recent announcement there, and best of luck to both of you here.
Peter Farrell: Thank you, Paul.
Kieran Gallahue: Thank Paul.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Maybe for my first question here, just if I could focus on the grossmargin here, historically I think in terms of your business mix we've usuallyseen an up tick in masks as a percentage of revenue here in the first quarterversus the previous quarter, which I think generally tends to help on you themargin side. But could you help us understand a little bit what effects contributed interms of your margin tick down here, and also what factor are sort of priceplayed in here in terms of the sequential gross margin decline?
Peter Farrell: Right, well the first point is, which I have are already alluded to, Paul,is that we had an unprecedented 19% increase in our costs just simply due tothe depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Aussie. The closingcurrency was $0.75 U.S. to $1 Aussie dollar a year ago quarter and now it was$0.89, and I think today it has hit $0.93. So this is that's unprecedented. However, having said that, there werecertainly price pressures, ASPs, which we talked about on the previous twoearnings calls. There has been pressure due to our major competitor droppingprices significantly buy 7, get 10 type of activity, so on the lower endproducts this obviously impacted the gross margin. We think it looks as though, as best we can assess it looks as though thepricing has stabilized, and Keith you might want to make a comment on that inthe U.S. whichis where most of the price pressure was. We still are getting because of thequality of our products; we're still getting a 10% to 15% up tick in our masks.We expect that to continue. The Swift II, the Quattro and the Libertyare extremely good products. We're very happy with them. But as far as grossmargin going forward, as we look into the wild blue yonder, with the U.S.dollar as I said trading at around $0.93 to the Aussie dollar as of thismorning. We'll be looking at around a 60 to 61 mark, but probably more likely a 60 asfar as we can see. Do you to make a comment, Keith or Brett?
Kieran Gallahue: Actually, this is Kieran. Let me just add one thing to that. We have notbeen, as you're suggesting, we have not seen in the United States and some ofthe other, actually some of the European countries, we have not seen prices gobelow where we saw them, sort of the most aggressive deals several months ago. What we are seeing is it is sort of going across the market now, and you'reseeing more customers getting those similar prices. So the positive sign hereis it appears that there’s a floor that has been established here for a numberof months, and the market dynamic is that we'll see those prices go to abroader range of customers over time. So pretty much what we expected to see is it is pretty much what we've beensaying here the last three, four months that we expected to see throughout thisyear, and I don't think there’s any change in that dynamic at that point.
Peter Farrell: Okay.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Then in just maybe as my follow-up, the international growth up tickeda little bit here, it looks like to rates we haven't seen here in a couple ofquarters. Can you help us sort of parse out maybe what the currency benefit wasor are we starting to see deeper penetration overseas?
Peter Farrell: Yes, I think, with the exception of Germany, we had extremely strong growth.And Germany, we're through that, unfortunately, Lasse Beijer is traveling,arrives in Australia later today, but Germany is softer than we would like. We've done what we believe we need to do in Germany.It is a work in progress, but even given Germanybeing weaker than we would like, the results were pretty good, and the constantcurrency figures, Brett, do you have that in front of you?
Brett Sandercock: Yes. It conceptually the impact on revenues of the appreciating Euro andAussie pretty much added around $6 million to the revenue number for thisquarter.
Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Tim Lee with Caris & Company.You may proceed.
Tim Lee - Caris & Company: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Peter Farrell: How are you, Tim?
Tim Lee - Caris & Company: Just in the U.S.,with pricing somewhat stabilizing, are we turning the corner and we can kind ofthink of this quarter as the low water mark and we can move up here from growthhere on a going-forward basis?
Peter Farrell: Well, Tim, I think we flagged last earnings call, in fact, I know we did.The first two quarters of '08 were going to be a struggle, and that's mainlybecause of the comparables, I mean we have got the ResMed motor technologieswhich we talked about on the last couple of calls. We've still got a couple of million there, and as you know, the sales therehave basically gone very far south. So we still got top comparables for Q2 '08,and I think as we look into the future, Q3 and Q4 look pretty comfortable forus.
Tim Lee - Caris & Company: And just in terms, one quick follow-up on the international side again. The18% growth, I mean that's not a blended number, so what is the internationalgrowth ex-Germany, so give us a sense of what growth could get to once Germanygets back on track.
Peter Farrell: Love to answer that, Tim, but that's not on the agenda.
Tim Lee - Caris & Company: Thought I'd try.
Peter Farrell: But thanks for the question.
Tim Lee - Caris & Company: All right, I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Peter Farrell: Okay.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Good afternoon, Peter.
Peter Farrell: How are you, Ben?
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Very well, thanks.
Peter Farrell: Good.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: And just maybe being a bit more specific on some of the P&L items, ifyou back out currency completely from the equation, what is the overall impacton EPS, by your calculations?
Peter Farrell: I will throw that to Brett. My rough calculation is $0.015. Brett?
Brett Sandercock: Yeah, if you roll it through and watch all accounting impact through and tryand model that, Ben, when we had a look at it, I think it is in the order of$0.01 to $0.015 for EPS, so the previous number there is pretty much spot-on asyou roll it through. That's the sort of impact. If you look at that against overall net income,you're looking at about a 4%, roughly that sort of number, impact fromcurrency. You can't be levels stay as they are, and that’s probably what willend up washing through the course of '08. So that's pretty much the impact aswe see it at the moment.
Peter Farrell: The bottom line, Ben, is that it is not fair.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Let's call the Fed and tell them to start raising rates.
Peter Farrell: Yeah, well, somebody has got to help.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: My follow-up question then is, as you think about the sheer magnitude of newproducts that you've got flowing through, Peter, why aren't we seeing bettertraction in sales? I mean, is price just that flat-out important to people but with salesgrowth, I should say, with the Quattro, the Liberty, all the different thingscoming through, why isn't that having a bigger impact?
Peter Farrell: Well again, Kieran referred to the price spread, and that's just somethingthat's happened. It is hard to get an actual, definite figure, how many of thecustomers does it flow through to, but I suspect we're through all of that. Myguess would be 90%. So, you’ve got those lower prices. Now it is mainly impacting the S8 Escape,the Tango, that lower end that 25% issue of the market. We've been able to maintain, as I already indicated, 10% to 15% higherprices for the masked products, and we're doing extremely well with theorder-setting products, and of course the VPAP Adapt SV, I mean, Respironics havecome out with their competitive product, and they're hammering that prettywell. We're very confident that as people get exposed to our algorithm, with the Easy-Breathetechnology and the much easier ease of use of our products, and they'repre-emptive. That is and we've had a couple of cases where patients just have not donewell on the competitive product, and have switched to the VPAP Adapt SV, or theACS II as it is outside the U.S. It’s just avery robust unit. Now, there is a lot of stuff that's got to wash through, but we are very,very happy with the Swift II, the Quattro, and the Liberty. Traditionally, you do see an up tick when we come out with new products, andwe are doing well with them, but it is a balance between the price pressuresand, as Kieran mentioned, flowing through particularly the U.S. market, whichis 53% of our total revenues of the Americas, and it just is what it is. I mean it is sort of inexplicable. We looked at some of those actions, andit’s not exactly logical to us. Maybe it is a game plan there. But since there were no real price pressures coming from the customers, theDME’s and the HME’s, it was just a grab for market share, and we just didn'tjump over the cliff.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: But, is it fair to say that unit volumes you would normally expect with anew product cycle are coming through but they're being partially offset byprice?
Peter Farrell: Correct.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: So you are not saying…
Peter Farrell: You should have answered my questions; you should have answered yourquestion.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: I am just trying to get…
Peter Farrell: That's it in a nutshell.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: You're not disappointed by the unit volume on the new products, though?
Peter Farrell: No.
Kieran Gallahue: Not at all, the new products are doing very, very well. The challenge reallycomes down to on some of the existing products where we have premiums thatstart to, the delta in pricing between our closest competitors start to getabove that 10% to 15% range, when they start to get to 20% to 25%, there isvolume implications on that.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Right, but the…
Kieran Gallahue: But the new products are doing great.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: But your unit volume growth overall for the masks and generators issatisfying, but it is being partially offset by price.
Peter Farrell: Right, now, look, you can always if you look at individual products, and yousay well, why that isn’t doing better, et cetera. I think we talked about theTango, and it’s a terrific unit, but it is in fact D featured. I mean in terms of its characteristics, operating characteristics, noise, etcetera, you can tick all the boxes, but it doesn't have EPR on it, and we'veseen that our guys are just not as good as selling into that low or essentialcare model as Apria calls it, selling into thatspace. So that hasn't gone as well as we would have liked. I might say that it'simproved, and there was the distraction of the recall, that's where we'reworking through that, but we're going to have to live with that through to theend of fiscal year, but it is much less frenetic. I mean, it's down from spending a quarter's of the guy's times on theaverage to around 10% to 15%, that did still having a small impact, but againas I said, it is fading. But yeah, at the lower end there which is, call it 25% to 30% of the market,and the price pressures are pretty significant, and the competition has beendropping their prices in their featured units, and that makes it a difficult spaceto operate in.
Ben Andrew - William Blair: Okay. Thank you.
Peter Farrell: Keith, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Keith Serzen: No, Peter, I think you did a fine job with that.
Operator: And gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro withBanc of America Securities. Go ahead.
Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Peter, on your guidance for the second half,you commented that you expected growth to get back to more market-like growth,and I am assuming you're referring to top line.
Peter Farrell: Yes.
Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities: So a couple of questions, do you view market growth as 15% or closer to 20%,and just to piggyback off of Ben's questions, are you referring to unit growthbeing back to market because I would imagine you're still going to face somepricing pressures on a year-over-year basis in the back end of the year? So that's a question one. If you can answer, and then you didn't mentionanything about the SA recall. Should we assume at this point it is completelybehind you? Thanks.
Peter Farrell: Okay. Let me take your first question, Glenn. We are talking unit growth. Infact, we were at a conference yesterday and there was a big discussion. There was a panel discussion where people from the U.S.were hooked in and so on and so forth. I am in Sydney. And the general consensus, and there is a bit of an echo chamber to thissort of thing, like you start believing your own echoes a little bit, but westill believe that outside the U.S. it is around 15%, and that's ROW ingeneral, and in the U.S. it’s around 20%, and we are indeed talking aboutvolumes of devices. Now, you can picture some scenarios where you can get an up tick goingforward, as we penetrate into some of the areas we're focusing on likeoccupational health and safety, for example. We are sort of optimistic, but at the moment as we look out there, I thinkyou can almost put the better volume growth of the order of 15% ROW and 20% inthe U.S. And again, you're quite right. The pricing pressures, the prices, theprices, they're not going to go away unless you innovate, and you've gotfeatures where people say, my God, I have always wanted one of those, whateverit is. We know that you can ask for and get higher prices. We are optimistic onsome of that stuff, but we can't talk about that specifically at the moment.
Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Just from a modeling point of view, in our reported revenue numbers in ourmodels we should be a touch below that 15% to 20%, which would reflect some of thepricing pressures you'd still face on a year-over-year basis.
Peter Farrell: Or I think that's fair. I think that’s fair. Now, on your second question,the recall, our estimate is that we're 30% to 40% through it, but the thing nowis it's going reasonably smoothly. I mean as well as these things can go thestuff that we do ourselves where we're well and truly on top of it andobviously we’re using Stericycle. And when it is once removed from your control, you do tend to have thingsnot run at quite as smoothly, but I think on the average, and I will get Keithto comment on this, on the average I think we're fairly satisfied. We're satisfied with the amount of provisioning we made. We're satisfied, ifyou looked into the wild blue yonder and said we're a shade under 40% of theunits back, you'd say, well, we would like a higher number, but it is what itis. It is like you take your car in, and you get something in the mail, and yourMercedes, something wrong with the brakes, and I don't know what you do, but Iwait until my next service. So, there is a bit of that going on but, Keith, doyou want to add anything?
Keith Serzen: Peter, I believe that you've answered that adequately as well.
Peter Farrell: Okay, well, thank you.
Keith Serzen: We have the inventory under control, Stericycle has the process undercontrol, the start-up issues that you'd have anytime you go through somethingthis large are for the most part behind us, and I think we're gatheringmomentum with this very nicely, but it will be with us for the balance of thiscalendar year, as we said all along.
Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Is it by any chance, again a piggybacking off of one of Ben's questions, asto why maybe you're not doing a little bit better with these launches becauseusually you do very well with a new product launch? Do you think, is there any more sales force distraction out there or is thatbehind us?
Kieran Gallahue: Glenn, what Peter had mentioned earlier on is that we still are getting somelevel of sales force distraction, hard to quantify it in specific terms. We estimate it to be in the 10% to 15% kind of a range, which means it hassome impact, but not much, certainly not like it was in the first quarter andactually at a declining rate as we move forward. And I would imagine that, as we get closer and closer to the end of thisthat any commitments of the sales force time on this will continue to getsmaller.
Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Farrell: And, Keith, I just listening to your answers, there I just wish you were onthe compensation committee.
Operator: Sir, your next question comes from the line of Mike Madsen with Wachovia. 
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: Thanks for taking my call.
Peter Farrell: Hi, Mike.
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: I guess first of all, just I know about this time last year, you all hadimplemented your internet policy, and I know it is a very small percentage ofyour sales, but I guess I believe that you're going to be lapping that startingin the December quarter, so that may give you a slight boost to your revenuegrowth. Is that a fair assessment?
Peter Farrell: Yes, I think it is. Keith is very close to the internet policy, and I thinkin fact Keith was the person who was most adamant that we really needed to putour foot down concerning internet sales.  And just to reiterate what we said before, that is because guys that areselling on the Internet feel no responsibility, at least a lot of them thatdon't have DME attached to it or an HME; they don't feel any responsibility tocall the patient because they don't get paid for it. So, we just think its bad medicine, but Keith, why don't you give us anupdate.
Keith Serzen: I just got a message from one of our Vice Presidents of Sales this morningthat told me about two customers in the northeastern part of the United States that had made a decision within thelast two days to switch over all of their business to ResMed because we are theonly one with an internet policy. And we are getting more stories like that as people do understand what ourmessaging has been. They do understand the impact on patient care and theimpact on the DME service model, and are now beginning to take action on justhow they're directing their business. So, Mike, in answer to your question about whether we measure anything inrelationship to the anniversary date of our internet policy, I don't thinkwe've got it quantified like that in any way, shape or form. It is more of a gut-level check from what we're hearing from the sales forceas our customers understand the messaging that we've been trying to get acrossand are now taking action on that messaging. We remain very pleased with ourinternet policy, and we remain very committed to our internet policy.
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: All right.
Peter Farrell: I think what we actually would like is for some of our competitors, one inparticular, to follow suit. We just think it is just better medicine. If youdon't get compliance, everybody loses.
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: It is understandable, let's see. Just on competitive bidding, and Iapologize if this question has come up, I was on another conference call, butjust what are you hearing from the HMEs in the initial areas? I realize it’s a very small portion of your revenues at this point, but justtrying to understand maybe what the longer-term impact of that will be? Do youhave any kind of sense of where the bids are ending up or anything along thoselines?
Peter Farrell: I am going to try that. You're quite right. It’s not right in our sweet spotthere in terms of concerns. I am going to throw that again to Keith.
Keith Serzen: So we don't know where the bids are coming in yet. We, know just as you do,Mike, when the bids are coming in, and supposed to be sorted out. The long-termimpact of that, who knows? It is really interesting to us that it seems that more of the bidders withina given marketplace seem to be not from that given marketplace, that we've gotpeople who haven't done business in a given market are now using this as anopportunity to try to expand their business models into a differentgeographical area. But in terms of, it basically is a discussion point for people in theindustry. It is a worry point for what the long range implications are, but youstill have a lot of people that wondering whether they will ever be able topull it off and go from the first ten MSAs to the second level with this. And once again as you heard us discuss many times before, it is still at theend of the day such a relatively small part of our business that we don't thinkit is going to have a material effect on our business.
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: Okay. And then just, can you provide an update on your sales forcestructure, just how much are they focusing on the sleep labs versus HME’s,because I guess it seems like in the past I know I guess Respironics had mademore of a push into the sleep labs, and I know you guys probably had a presencein both, but just wondering if you can give us an update there?
Keith Serzen: Are you asking me to answer that question for the U.S.market, Mike?
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: More U.S.focused I guess, to be honest.
Keith Serzen: Okay. So we have for the last several years had an increased level of focuson the sleep lab with our sales reps as well as with our clinical team. Thatcontinues. We view the sleep labs as an incredibly important call point for us,both from a standpoint of the scripting that they do as well as from the increasinglevel of vertical integration with the sleep labs dispensing therapy. So our call pattern has not changed much over the last two years. Wecontinue to market our technology to the sleep labs, and our Adapt SV, and thesuccess we've had with that, kind of speaks to the presence that we've had inthe sleep labs. It remains high, will remain high.
Mike Madsen - Wachovia: Okay. That's all I've got. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO CapitalMarkets. Go ahead.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you for taking my question.
Peter Farrell: Hi, Joanne.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Hi. Can you give us a breakout between masks and flow generators in thequarter?
Peter Farrell: Yes, we can certainly attempt to do that. Give me two seconds here. Okay. Iwill give you a geographic mix which is 53%, in fact, that's almost identicalto the last few quarters. But 53% for the Americas,39% was Europe, and 8% was Asia Pac. In looking to flow generators, and masks and accessories, the flowgenerators were 14% increase. The masks and accessories were 13% increase, andthe overall was 14%. So they are pretty in line. But you asked for the split. And I think Joanne; you wanted the split between the sales. What percentagewas masks and accessories, right?
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: And what percentage of them came from what markets?
Keith Serzen: So the Americas versus ROW, do you want me to give those, Peter?
Peter Farrell: Yes, why don't you do that Chris?
Kieran Gallahue: Kieran, here.
Peter Farrell: Yes.
Keith Serzen: Hasn't done this for about 15 years, but that's all right.
Kieran Gallahue: The Americas, let me just do the normal breakout, in the Americas flowgenerators were up 12%, masks and accessories were up 7%, for a total of 9%.
Peter Farrell: Bear in mind the total increase was 11% because that's messed up a littlebit by ResMed Motor Technologies, so the overall was bottom was 11% if we're…
Kieran Gallahue: And if we back out RMT, the flow generators were 12% and masks andaccessories 11%.
Peter Farrell: 12% and 11% is closer to the truth. The 7% reflects that impact of our lossof external business for RMT.
Kieran Gallahue: On the ROW side, flow generators were up 16%, masks and accessories were up25%, for a total of 19%, and then again that puts down to the 14% totalbusiness.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And if I did my math right, it looks like you had a lower tax ratethis quarter, in the 28% range. Can you comment on that and tell me what weshould be thinking about on a go-forward basis?
Brett Sandercock: Joanne, it is Brett. That's right. That tax rate for this quarter is alittle lower. In Germany they actually reduced their corporate tax rate byaround 10%, so we did have a one-off benefit around $700,000. And we restated some of our deferred tax balances over there, so if you backthat out, we're back to more like a 30.8% effective tax rate, and I think goingforward it should be sort of around that sort of level, certainly won'tcontinue at that low tax rate for Q1, but around sort of 30.8% mark.
Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then, can you comment on where you think diagnosis is going tocome out?
Peter Farrell: Yeah. Again, there was a discussion, a panel yesterday, and I don't want togive any investment bank a free kick, but the consensus was that it willhappen. And if you ask me, I am saying it’s about 75% sure. Why do I say that? First of all it’s you have the rumor mill, which is neververy accurate. But second, when NCD’s are looked at and normally when CMS makesa decision, they rarely reconsider it within a five-year period at least that'swhat we've been told. This is about two years and it would seem that there issome feeling within CMS that portal monitoring is a sensible way to go. Now, if you look at the prevalence of sleep disorder breathing versus, say,type-2 diabetes or asthma. And if you use that as kind of a model, you cannoteven imagine a circumstance, where every asthmatic patient for a Ventolin dosehad to go and see a pulmonologist or a respirologist, I mean the system wouldjust collapse. And the same is also true, if one looks at diabetes. I mean management ofdiabetes is really mostly primarily care physicians, internists, and so forth.The specialists see the acute exacerbations, so when the dam actually breaksand the sleep market starts to mature, people will be begging for portablemonitoring. And we see the growth potential beyond the current structure, where you havethe structure of DME’s and HME’s, they'll still be very important goingforward, but we see that that paradigm has to change really because it is justnot set up for scalability. And portal monitoring will become part of it and Iam pretty sure we're on the right tack there. When are these things going to happen? Obviously a favorable NCD ruling isgoing to be right in the sweet spot. The question is, how prescriptive orrestrictive will that be? And that I think is really where we're very, veryunsure. Now, clearly the AASM, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine whoopposed, very adamantly opposed portable monitoring. One might say there is alittle bit of conflict there because of lot of the members of the AASM actuallyown their own sleep labs. But my comment to that would be you're much better off fishing in the Pacific Ocean than Lake Ontario.In other words, you got these big nets you pull in all sorts of other sleepdisorder problems. It will be a different mix than what the labs are currentlyaddressing. There will be much more narcolepsy, cataplexy etcetera. And also complexsleep apnea, which is really the space where that ought to be treated in thesleep lab, so the easy low hanging fruit, if you like, will be taken care of Ithink outside the current structure. But look, that's just blue sky. I think, yes, it will be approved. I couldbe wrong, obviously. I don't know, but I would say it’s a 75%. What would bethe concern is how restrictive is that and is CMS trying to keep everybody happyin which case, if it’s very restrictive then, you know, it’s not going toreally advance the field.
Joanne Lynch - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you very much.
Peter Farrell: Thank you.
Operator: Then your next questions from the line of Joshua Zable of Natixis, go ahead.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Farrell: Hi, Joshua.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Just wanted to get some more color on S8 II. I know I am surprised no oneelse asked this earlier. I know you went into a little detail about thetechnology. I am trying to understand. The nameobviously of the S8 II would indicate that is in the same footprint as the S8but the name changed as opposed to one of those fancy names you usually giveit, maybe it's more than that, it’s just not technology, I don't know. Can yougive me a little bit more color on it?
Peter Farrell: Yes. The naming is always one of these things, you know, why isn't it an S9and so on, but it is the same footprint, and I guess that's what reallydetermined in most people's minds, the consensus if you like, to call it an S8.But it is a really completely redesigned motor. I mean I was in Europe and Sweden for the European Respiratory Societymeeting towards the end of September, and we had the guys there had done somedemonstrations in Switzerland and Austria. And two sleep physicians, our salesguys, and the reports back were just incredibly encouraging. This is one quiet unit, but in addition to that, with the redesign of theinternal, in particular the motor, the breathing characteristics are justabsolutely stunning. You know, breathing in and out, there is virtually nochange at all in the pressure. In other words, some devices, you go back years ago, you get swings of 4 to 5 centimeters breathing in andbreathing out. It was just awful impedance. This thing is almost zeroimpedance. It is quiet as a mouse. I mean, you can believe your own dreams to acertain extent, but I talked to the Austrian and Swiss guys who did thedemonstration. And this is a great product.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: I guess what I am trying to understand is the way to think about it, sort ofas the highest end of the S8 family or is this going to be, even though it’sthe same footprint. Is this going to replace the S8 and sort of the same waythe S8 took over for the S7, the S8 II in a similar footprint but now you getall the different features of the various S8 models but on a much quieter model?
Peter Farrell: Listen, Joshua, if you want to buy quite a few of the older versions, we canprobably help you out. Yes. The characteristics will flow through all of the S8family, and we think it is going to be, it is going to be really well receivedas I said, so yes, it is going to flow through all the family. And franklywe're excited about it.
Kieran Gallahue: And this is Kieran, just to add a little bit to Peter's comments, when yousay substantially the same, Josh, this is actually the same. So, from theoutside of the box, you're not going see a difference other than some of thelabeling. We're using the same box so that we can get scale opportunities onthat. So, you can use the same accessories. It is seamless from a customer perspective, but it’s got a totally newengine in it. And the second thing to note is it hasn't been released yet, inthe U.S. or inthe Americas.It doesn't come until later in the fiscal year. So, we'll see that impact lateron. This product is absolutely incredible. The engine, as Peter was noting, isquiet. It is capable, and it allows an increase in functionality.
Peter Farrell: In fact, the breathing characteristics, just to follow on from Kieran'scomments there, are just so much better even though, the S8 is a great product,the breathing characteristics on this just kind of knock your socks off. It isa bit like getting a Porsche Turbo and putting a chip in it, and going from450-horsepower to 600-horsepower. This is really a swish unit.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great, and then just on Saime, can we get anupdate? I know I usually ask this once a quarter.
Peter Farrell: We'll have to wait until Elisee comes. Thewrinkles are out of the VS Series, the Ultra, the Integra, etcetera, that iscoming off the blocks very nicely. We're happy with that. Still, some work todo on the 150, 250 and 350 Elisee. Every thing is moving in the rightdirection. Kieran, you might want to comment because you just were over withthe European leadership team, but it was the same was a good buy. We did get a few more surprises than we anticipated. We were locked in, aswe said in previous conference calls, to not expanding the customer base, andwe're getting ready now to go beyond that. Kieran, you might want to say a fewwords.
Kieran Gallahue: Yes, I think what you said is right on target. We're making very goodprogress on the quality side. We're moving a substantial portion, in fact allof it by the end of the year of the VS production down to our plant in Sydney,because the technology has stabilized to the point. And the quality levels haverisen to the point, where we have the ability to do that. So, it is a very encouraging sign from both quality and from the ability toincrease capacity. And quality levels of Elisee, particularly the Elisee 150have increased dramatically. So, the team is making very, very good progress onit. The business itself has grown in double-digits. So, we're quite pleasedwith it.
Peter Farrell: And just to add one more thing there, the 150 is obviously the main lineproduct. The 250’s and 350’s are more your hospital-based products, so the 150as a portable ventilator is where we want to be with a nice big screen, verycustomer friendly. If the thing works the way it is supposed to work.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Great.
Peter Farrell: That's the more important one.
Joshua Zable - Natixis: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Andrew Goodsall of UBS. You mayproceed.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Good morning, team. I just wanted to get an indication…
Peter Farrell: Good meeting yesterday, Andrew.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Yes, great, glad you came along. We really appreciated it. Try to give me abit of information on what sort of contribution Adapt SV had made to thisresult.
Peter Farrell: Yes, we’re seeing. We don't breakdown products into how is X, Y and Z going,but it is double-digit growth.
Andrew Goodsall - UBS: Okay. Great, thanks very much.
Peter Farrell: All right, Andrew.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Peter Farrell: Excellent, thanks.
Kieran Gallahue: All right, so, why don't we wrap up the call? Peter, do you want to do thewrap-up?
Peter Farrell: I think we've probably exhausted everything, Kieran, unless you want to saygoodbye to everybody. I am happy to say goodbye.
Kieran Gallahue: Sounds like a good idea. Thank you for all your interest today.
Peter Farrell: Thanks very much, guys.
