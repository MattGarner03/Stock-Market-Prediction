===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be on listen-only. However, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Roopesh Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Roopesh Aggarwal: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2025 first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2025 first quarter results and highlights, provide updated 2025 assumptions, and share recent business and regulatory updates. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. Some comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Roopesh, and good morning, everybody. Xcel Energy, we know that economic growth and prosperity of our communities, and country depends on our ability to deliver energy to our customers, when and where they need it, while keeping their bills as low as possible. This commitment to our communities and customers is demonstrated in our results this morning. In the first quarter 2025, Xcel Energy delivered earnings of $0.84 per share, invested $2.3 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure for our customers, and accelerated our wildfire risk reduction efforts to enable safer and more resilient communities. Brian will provide more details in a minute. But based on our results for the first quarter, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our earnings guidance for the 21st year in a row, one of the best track records in the industry. As you can imagine, over the past several months, we've been engaging at the federal level with legislators and administration officials as executive orders, trade and tariff actions and pending legislation will likely have impacts on future energy infrastructure. Not surprising to anyone on this call, we're in an unprecedented period of electric demand growth and believe that we need a broad scope of energy resources to meet those needs. We see increased electric demand from the oil and gas sector. We see demand from residential customer growth, EV adoption and beneficial electrification across our service territories. We see demand from data centers in Texas, Colorado, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. And in the medium-term, we expect to see continued trends towards electrification as well as re-onshoring as potential outcome of federal actions. The infrastructure to serve this demand growth needs to be thoughtfully planned as well. We and many in our industry have been advocating in D.C. for policies that allow for cost effective and rapid adoption of new energy resources. That includes preservation of tech neutral tax credits, wind, solar, storage and nuclear, their associated transferability provision in various loan and grant programs. That includes advocating for siting, permitting and other federal actions that would allow for more rapid construction of the assets needed to serve this growing demand and that includes advocating for federal actions that can mitigate the potential for wildfires and their associated financial impacts. Additionally, we're paying close attention to ongoing tariffs and other recent federal actions. As you are all aware, this remains a highly fluid situation, potentially positively changing as recently as yesterday. On the tariff front, we believe that our base capital plan remains intact and that the impacts are both modest and manageable. While we're still evaluating, we estimate that roughly 40% to 45% of our capital expenditures are material based with the balance being labor permitting and other items, and of this percentage a majority is domestically sourced. There are some notable exceptions though. In particular, our industry has exposure to Chinese tariffs related to battery storage. In our base capital plan, we only have one significant battery project, which we continue to work to mitigate any risks, but in our longer-term plans we see a need for more battery and other related energy storage assets. Based on these recent tariff actions, we expect a relatively rapid evolution of the battery supply chain similar to what we've experienced in solar panels over the last three to four years. We estimate that our total tariff exposure on our $45 billion base capital plan for 2025 to 2029 is approximately 2% to 3%, and that's before we work through any incremental vendor mitigation actions. We remain confident in our ability to navigate this evolving environment and keep delivering for our customers and investors. We see incredible energy and demand needs across the country. In total, Xcel Energy anticipates that we will need to deliver between 15,000 and 29,000 megawatts of new generation by year-end 2031 to serve our customers and communities. During the first quarter, we continue to make progress on our -- with our various commissions on these needs, which also helped give line of sight to our $10 billion plus incremental investment pipeline. In February, the Minnesota PUC approved our integrated resource plan settlement for nearly 5,000 megawatts of generation. Included are 720 megawatts of company-owned natural gas generation and battery storage and approximately 2,800 megawatts of wind generation which will reuse the transmission interconnect from our Sherco facility. RFPs for resources that make up the balance of the IRP will work their way through regulatory processes in 2025 and 2026, details of which are included in our disclosures and in the attached presentation. In Texas and the Mexico, our teams continue to evaluate proposals for generation to meet growing demand. As a reminder, we're seeking 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts through a competitive RFP process including projects being proposed by the company. We're encouraged by the early results and plan to make a recommended filing in Q2. And in Colorado, we continue to make progress with our energy resource plan filing that we made in October of last year. We're recommending the addition of 5,000 to 14,000 megawatts of new generation to meet projected sales growth of 3% to 7% per year. The commission decision is expected in the fall of this year. As part of these resource planning processes, I've been asked to comment on the impacts of recent executive orders on coal plants. Our generation retirement strategy is the product of long-term planning process with state commissions and other stakeholders that seeks to balance energy demand with long-term assets that we need for our customers. With access to some of the country's best wind and solar resources as well as incremental natural gas generation, we've demonstrated that we can retire these inefficient and aging coal plants while ensuring reliability and keeping customer bills low. Continue to evaluate the executive orders and work with federal and state agencies as well as our communities and customers on any next steps. Alongside our access to some of the country's lowest cost renewable resources, our thoughtful investments and focus on continuous improvement have helped keep our residential electric bill growth below the rate of inflation for the past decade and among the lowest in the country. As we continue to grow, the tech neutral and nuclear PTCs have also proven a critical tool for customer affordability. Since 2018, Xcel Energy customers have saved over $5 billion in avoided fuel costs and PTCs from wind generation and this year our Upper Midwest customers will see an additional benefit of nearly $250 million on their bills from nuclear production tax credits. We continue to actively engage with elected officials in the U.S. House and Senate, and key agencies such as DOE to reinforce the critical importance that these incentives play in keeping bills low for our residential and business customers. We believe that policymakers are aligned in the belief that lowering energy costs for Americans is a key policy objective. We continue to remind them these incentives play an important role in helping us meet that objective. Xcel Energy also continues to make significant progress to protect our customers and communities and systems from the threats of extreme weather. On the regulatory front in Colorado, we reached a constructive settlement on our updated $1.9 billion wildfire mitigation plan, including a securitization mechanism to manage customer bill impact. In Texas, we also reached a constructive settlement on our $500 million system resiliency plan. We expect commission decisions in both proceedings by third quarter 2025, and we'll continue to prioritize these investments to improve resiliency and reduce risk on our systems. And on the policy front, we've seen progress with several pieces of constructive wildfire legislation. In Texas, legislation was introduced where material compliance with an approved wildfire mitigation plan provides an affirmative defense to civil liability related to wildfire damage. In North Dakota, legislation that provides a utility similar protection was passed by both chambers and awaits the Governor's signature. We believe these bills could also serve as frameworks in our other states for future legislation. Looking forward, our focus for 2025 remains unchanged. Xcel Energy is working to deliver on our earnings for the 21st year in a row to capture the unprecedented opportunities for growth we laid out in our capital plans, to deliver on our incremental capital opportunities backlog, advance our clean energy leadership and raise the bar on delivering a compelling experience for our customers in order to make energy work better for them and the communities we serve. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results, Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.84 per share for the first quarter of 2025, compared to earnings of $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2024. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: electric and natural gas sales growth and regulatory outcomes increased earnings by $0.21 per share and other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. Higher depreciation and amortization reflecting our capital investment programs decreased earnings by $0.09 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Now let me comment quick in more detail on O&M expenses for the first quarter, which totaled $686 million or $81 million higher than in 2024. We expected O&M expenses to be front loaded this year with the increase due to known items such as higher nuclear outage amortization costs, increased insurance premiums, benefit costs and the impact of a 2024 gain on land sale. Some of the increased wildfire related expenses are subject to regulatory decisions later this year. These results are in line with our year-to-date O&M expense budget and we reaffirm our full year guidance of a 3% increase in O&M expenses relative to 2024. Turning to sales, first quarter weather and leap year adjusted electric sales increased 2% driven by growth across most operating companies and customer segments. For 2025, we continue to expect full year weather adjusted electric sales to increase 3%, as the current tariff and economic outlook evolves, we will continue to monitor any potential impacts to our sales outlook. Shifting to rate case activity, in Wisconsin, we filed our 2026 to 2027 electric and natural gas rate cases requesting a total revenue increase of $151 million and $24 million respectively, over two years. That's based on a forward test here, a 10% ROE and an equity ratio of 53.5%. We were evaluating filing electric and natural gas rate cases in Colorado and an electric rate case in New Mexico later this year. Moving to data centers, we are making solid progress on our high probability pipeline and remain on track to meet our goal of contracting our total base plan by this fall. Xcel Energy continues to receive requests for new data centers in its service territories. We are managing a robust pipeline and remain committed to our data center contract principles, ensuring new contracts maximize benefits to all customers and protect Xcel Energy from stranded asset risk. We also continue to make strong progress in the Smokehouse Creek wildfire claims process. We've resolved 151 of the 225 submitted claims, which we continue to view as constructive. We have committed $113 million in settlement agreements of which $79 million have been paid through Q1. Based on current information and settlement activity, we have updated the low end of our estimated liability to $290 million, which remains well below our insurance of $500 million as we described in our earnings disclosure. As part of the increase, we have resettlements related to some previously excluded categories such as compensation for railroad claims and settled claims related to tree damage. We've also updated our disclosures in Marshall in particular as it relates to two new causation theories introduced by plaintiffs in expert reports that were submitted in the first quarter of 2025. We remain in expert discovery until mid-July and are preparing for a trial in late September. Moving to guidance, we remain confident and reaffirm our ability to deliver earnings within our $3.75 to $3.85 guidance range for the year. Updates to key assumptions are included in our slides and earnings release. With that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. Xcel Energy posted first quarter 2025 earnings of $0.84 per share. We continue to lead the clean energy transition while ensuring safe, clean and reliable service and keeping customer bills as low as possible. We are focused on reducing operating risk in our system from extreme weather. We reached settlements with our Texas and Colorado resiliency and wildfire mitigation plans to see progress on constructive legislation in Texas and North Dakota. We have strong line of sight with our $10 plus billion investment pipeline with approval for at least 5,000 megawatts of generation resources in Minnesota and awards for $3 billion to $4 billion of transmission in MISO and SPP. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit metrics using a balance of debt and equity to fund accretive growth. And finally, we reaffirm our 2025 EPS guidance of $3.75 to $3.85. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Campanella: Hey, thanks so much for taking the questions.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, morning, Nick.
Nicholas Campanella: I just wanted -- Morning, morning. I wanted to ask, I appreciate all your comments in the prepared remarks. You are kind of a big transferability beneficiary. We're going through budget reconciliations right now. If there's any kind of outcome where the tax credits get sunsetted sooner within your five-year plan, how do you kind of think about the offsets to cash flow considering there might be a positive attribution to rate base as well? Do you still see some type of true cash impact and maybe you can kind of walk through how the plan could absorb that?
Bob Frenzel: Hey Nick, it's Bob. And I'll start and then I'll give Brian some time to get to some of the details. But there's been a lot of conversation around transferability in general, at least in the investor community, not actually a lot in D.C. and I've spent a lot of time there. Transferability was architected as part of the IRA. We think it's explicitly -- explicably linked to the credit program themselves. We know there's a lot of support as evidenced by letters that, that Congress and the Senate have written to their respective Finance and Ways and Means Committees around support for continuation of the credits in some fashion and form. And by that measure, we think the transferability continues along with those credits. So as I sit here today, I think very positively about the credits that come from our legacy projects, projects that are in service, projects that we've safe harbored and then depending on where the credits go in general, I think the transferability stays aligned with those credit profiles over time. But maybe I'll let Brian comment a little bit on some of the details you asked on rate base and/or cash flow implications.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, and maybe I'll talk about it in two different avenues and feel free to ask further questions if I don't hit on exactly what you're thinking about. No, I think about one is there's been a lot of discussion around the bill introduced by Representative Fedorchak in terms of -- but when you actually look at what that bill does, it doesn't impact transferability on any projects in service and it doesn't impact transferability on projects that would have been Safe Harbored last year under the old regime of tax credits. So when we think about it in terms of what we Safe Harbored last year for projects, we're in a really good spot basically through 2028 when you look at the four-year Safe Harbor with projects last year. And so we would expect those to have credits and transferability associated with them. So really the door check bill would be a 2029 impact. But how it steps down, it's a 20% credit in 2029. Now certainly we're not advocating for that bill because there's significant long-term customer impacts. But from a transferability perspective, in our cash flow perspective, we are very comfortable with that in terms of how it deals with prior wind farms and what would have been Safe Harbor last year in the old regime. Now your question I get is a little bit more what happened if transfer really went away for all projects, even in service or future projects. We do not believe, as Bob said, that will happen. Congress generally does not disturb decisions that have been made by businesses. They recognize the need for business certainty. But if that did happen, pick a point; you hit it on head, right? Rate base goes up because you're less tax efficient. We have an impact to our cash flow. So you would look at issuing some equity to manage some of those credit impacts. But longer-term it just becomes a timing issue where you're pushing those cash flows out in the future. But there's also alternative ways. You could look at tax equity in the regulated environment. But one of the more interesting concepts, and we do this in one of our jurisdictions is you can flow PTCs back in an alternative method. Everyone thinks about PTCs being flowed back over the 10-year period as they're generated in one of our jurisdictions, we flow them back over the life of the project. So pick a wind farm, 30 years, flowing back over 30 years, that improves your cash flow in the near-term, reduces attacks and efficiency and also provides a pretty stable, call it customer profile from bill impacts. So there's absolutely things that we think of internally that, that maybe not be understood externally. When we think about how do we manage if that scenario, like I said, we don't expect will happen, but how we manage if it did happen.
Nicholas Campanella: That's really helpful color. I appreciate that. Thank you. Just one quick question, just the broader kind of tariff outlook and how it's affecting economic development in your service territory. Your C&I sales that you guys put up on a weather adjusted basis still seems strong. I know that's at the end of March. Maybe you can kind of comment on how activity has changed in the service territory at all in real time. And clearly you're kind of reaffirming your load outlook here. So it seems like you're comfortable. But yes, maybe just a few more details there. Thanks.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Hey Nick, let me start. Look, definitely the sentiment meter has changed over the last 45 days. I don't think we've seen a lot of change in actual activity yet either on the consumer or the C&I side. But what you see in here in this earnings season from a lot of people who've already announced, whether it's banks or industrial manufacturers, there's a thoughtfulness around deploying capital right now, a thoughtfulness about the uncertainty of the regime that we sit in. And there is a lot of conversation and maybe sparked over the last couple, two or three days around how quickly could this environment change as well? We saw it hit very quickly. We've seen some peel back already. You've seen the market respond to that already. And so we use the word in our prepared remarks of dynamic or fluid. And I continue to believe that we don't see a lot of impacts right now in the customer. But we're cautiously optimistic that we work through this through the balance of the year. And obviously we've reiterated our guidance and sales forecast accordingly.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, I can just provide a little bit extra color on that too. Obviously one of the areas when you think about where the price of oil has gone, we serve the Delaware Basin, the most prolific basin. But we've been in contact with our large oil and gas customers in terms of expectations there, and they haven't changed. A little bit of feedback we got though is they're watching tariffs and how that could impact their business. But so far we haven't seen that impact on us. Our sales to that mining and transportation sector were up 9% quarter over -- year-over-year, specifically down in SPS. So still seeing it there. One area we saw a little bit of weakness in March was just in Colorado on the small C&I sales. But again, one month doesn't make a trend. So just something that we're watching. But overall, right now we sit here feeling comfortable with reaffirming our 3% sales growth for the year.
Nicholas Campanella: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys, very much, appreciate it. Look, if I can follow-up on Nick's question, it's really been a focus from a lot of folks on this transferability stuff. Just to go back to the, should we say alternative that you were talking to a second ago about the 30-year flow back? I mean, would that suffice in most of your cases? I get everything is discrete and specific, but do you see that sort of meaningfully offsetting the equity risk scenario here that, that could emerge from going back to, shall we say, the prior regime? I just want to make sure I understand kind of the total impact of what you're contemplating there, as well as just to clarify your specific docs, I know there's several different credits here and the eligibility for various credits to qualify for transparency, it could be bifurcated, it seems like. You can speak to that a little bit too.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Julien, let me first let me again reiterate that we don't expect transferability to go away particularly for projects that are in service and for the stuff that have already been safe harbored, particularly under the old regime as we think about it when the credits change from old regime to tech neutral this year. But yes, an alternative mechanism significantly reduces our equity impact. So you also have to remember that or how we think about financing it. We also have to remember this drives rate base goes up too when you have tax inefficiency. So -- but now as we think about this alternative fallback mechanism, obviously we'd work with our regulators on approval of it. But it is what we think about a very good solution in terms of how to manage some of the credit impacts. And another I'd say we have a strong balance sheet. We maintain a strong balance sheet for a reason. If you have to manage through any of these impacts, it's a timing issue when you think about this in terms of when you can monetize it. So overall, I wanted to provide some color on scenario that probably most of our investors don't understand that there are alternatives out there in terms of how you can flow back these and there are benefits to customers and to the company and how we do it, so. And then your question was around bifurcating different treatment accredits. Certainly the Fedorchak bill was just focused on wind and solar. It didn't impact the storage credits or the nuclear credits. But also we think that is just a marker out there as Bob's comments provided; there is a lot of support across Republican states. If you think about the House of -- the House letter that had 21 Republicans signed on to it. The Senate letter that had four senators signed onto it for Republican senators. So I think there's an understanding of the importance of the economy of these credits and what they do. There's a couple good studies out there about the economic impacts and the 14 million plus jobs that the IRA will create over the next 10 years. So that's how I think about it in terms of overall and transferability being a key part of it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. Hey, thank you for the details. Just following-up here nicely done. But can you provide some further elaboration on what's in this Colorado wildfire mitigation plan settlement agreement? It seems like there's some good stuff in there. But just want to speak to that a little bit more. If you can elaborate on what exactly is in that sort of plan.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thanks Julien, I can handle that. Yes, overall, a very constructive settlement with a unanimous settlement with all the parties in that wildfire mitigation plan. Again, if you remember, that's a three-year plan, $1.9 billion split between $1.6 billion of capital and $300 million of O&M. And how we think about it is it's a win-win from all sides is we get constructive cost recovery here in the near-term. We also get an extension of our insurance deferral that we had a one year extension that, that expired in October. So we have an extension of that excess liability insurance deferral. But we also agreed to secure ties approximately 1 point or seek to securitize $1.2 billion of spend by 2020 -- and by 2029. And that's really a helpful way to manage overall customer affordability. So when we look at this total package, we think it's a really good outcome to reach a unanimous settlement with a number of parties in that proceeding was again a good outcome. And we look forward to having the hearing in front of the commission here I think within a month.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you guys. See you soon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start on your comments on the tariff exposure that 2% to 3% on the capital plan, could you just talk a little bit about the process or the timeline over which you'd expect to have those discussions with vendors and any sense of where you think that exposure could potentially go post having those discussions?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Carly, good morning. I can take that one. Some of these discussions have already happened. When you think about certain project specific contracts that, that we're working on, whether it's renewable projects, storage projects, I think about that 2% to 3% being as absolutely manageable. When you think about that's a five-year time period, so the conversations have started working through specific ones but also working with various suppliers in terms of how much do they absorb, what happens there. But we also are already looking at how do you diversify from a supply base. So I'll give you a recent example. We recently signed an agreement for substation power transformers. This is, I believe last week that we signed it. This is where scale and scope comes in. So we signed an agreement with nine different suppliers, five U.S. domestic manufacturers, four global manufacturers, to give us that kind of ability to source where we think it is most effective for our customers. So I would say these discussions have been going on and not only just recently, but there was an expectation that tariffs were coming. When the election happened back in November, we expected tariffs. We included tariff impacts into the bids we made in our RFP and down in SPS in January. So I wouldn't view it as conversations have just started, but it's now as we understand where they are, then it's how do you navigate.
Carly Davenport: Got it. Appreciate that, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the liability related to Smokehouse Creek going up to 290. I think you had highlighted in the prepared remarks inclusion of some previously excluded verticals. But just curious if there's anything else that you see at this point that could pose risk to that number continuing to move higher or you guys still feel good about wherever that number goes relative to the insurance coverage.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I'll give you a little bit more color. No, the way I think about it is we're making really good progress on the overall claims. If you look at the details, we've settled 151 of the claims that come through our process. So we've settled more than we took in, in Q1. So making progress in terms of closing that from our internal claims process. We also have 25 lawsuits filed against us. What I didn't say in the opening remarks is we've settled or dismissed five of those already. So we've turned to settling the represented claims. And as you said in your question, and as I said in my opening remarks, we've now had settled with the railroad entities which was not in our low end accrual before we settled with utility entity that was not in our low end accrual. And we have made some settlements for tree damages and so we've included the settlement payments in our $290 million accrual. There's also one other call large claim that we've gone through the discovery process and included in our accrual. So from that perspective, again, it is following accounting guidance. It's a low end accrual and you can see what we excluded in our disclosures. But overall, I was pointing to people that we have approximately $500 million of insurance coverage and we are well under that policy limit as we sit here today and we'll continue to make progress over the balance of the year on these claims.
Carly Davenport: Great. Great to see the progress there. Thanks so much for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I actually just have one. All of the questions have been asked. Just any updated thoughts on the Marshall Fire, any conversations with stakeholders as we're approaching trial here this fall? Anything new there? Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Durgesh, yes, I think, just as I noted in my prepared remarks, that in the plaintiff's expert reports, we received two new causation theories, one related to a partially unattached piece of telecom equipment making contact with our line and the other one, that being an unidentified flying object making contact with our line. So four theories in total. When you look at the Sheriff's report, the Boulder Sheriff's report, which had the ignition being our first line, and then the underground coal seam. So that's where we are, I think a little bit of discussions just from a process perspective. We have mediation process in this case that's standard for trials such as this; deadline for mediation is May 29. So we'll work through that process. But as we sit here today and as we said before, we're diligently preparing ourselves for trial, which starts September 26.
Durgesh Chopra: Awesome. Thanks, Brian.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Hey, Durgesh, just one thing I'd add on there that I think is important is the -- that we believe that our indemnity agreements on our poll attachments are strong. As we think about the causation theories that have been proposed, that's just an important one to think through.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Hey Jeremy, how are you?
Jeremy Tonet: Good, good, thanks. Just want to, I guess, start off, could you elaborate on potential regulatory treatment of wildfire related O&M expense and are you expecting to recover some of these costs and what type of -- what kind of assumptions underpin your guidance at this point?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Jeremy, I think underpinning our guidance as such is always constructive regulatory treatment. I'll kind of hit on a couple. One, we talked about the Colorado Wildfire Mitigation Plan. Now that's a unanimous settlement, still awaiting commission hearing and approval. But that includes concurrent recovery for our O&M expenses related to our wildfire investments. And so that, as I said is a very good constructive outcome in awaiting the decision by the commission there. We have filed regulatory deferral for regulatory deferrals around our insurance premiums. We made a filing in Wisconsin, Texas, and New Mexico. And so we expect decisions there probably Q2, Q3 time frame on those three filings. And then in Minnesota, that would just be part of our rate case. We've included our wildfire O&M expenses and investments in the rate case, which has a forecast year for 2025. And that decision will play out that proceedings a little bit longer dated. But overall, we do assume constructive regulatory outcomes overall just as part of general guidance assumptions year in and year out.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe pivoting towards -- back towards data centers here. It seems like a lot of the pipeline has been in Minnesota, but just wanted to see, I guess, how you see things developing across other service territories, especially Colorado. Could there be kind of a broadening of this?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I think, as we've spoken about this, the last few calls we talk about, you're absolutely right. You've heard us talk about the opportunities in Minnesota and the interest we've seen there. We've seen it expand beyond Minnesota as you allude to. One, we already have a data center in construction in Colorado. That was one of our signed contracts. And the three contracts we're working on right now is what I talked about in my opening remarks that we expect to have signed by this fall. One is in Colorado. We also worked on what we call a large load cluster study in Colorado. And you look at looking at called this colocation area near the Denver Airport in Aurora, which was not only some data center customers but also a large industrial customer and a large distribution center. So gaining interest in Colorado. But we also have a lot of interest in Wisconsin too. So as we think about it, we have signed agreements in three different states today. And then we also the three agreements that we're working on, one in Wisconsin, one in Minnesota, one in Colorado. So it's helpful to kind of see that interest across our states. And we're also seeing growing interest in the Dakotas. There was a land sale last year in South Dakota to a data center. So we continue to receive inbound inquiries and have a strong pipeline. So our goal is to execute on fulfilling that kind of what we call high probability pipeline by this fall for our investors and really for our customers. When we look at the benefit it creates for our customers and maintaining affordability.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. I'd add in the Southwest as well, we filed AQ studies with the Southwest Power Pool for thousands of megawatts of data center inquiries down there. A little bit further back in our probability pipeline for data centers. But we're still seeing lots of interest down there. Think about it, our SPFC and I-tariff is one of the lowest in the country and has attracted some attention as well.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And just want to go back to Colorado if I could one last one. How do you think about pacing a high Colorado investment against high sales growth as you've outlined there? Do you see any periods of relatively elevated bill inflation as investments come in ahead of load? Just wondering, stakeholder feedback on bill inflation in Colorado?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I mean we have a significant investment plan in Colorado and I think we are very focused on affordability. Maybe I started from a little bit higher level is if we look at our customer bills in Colorado on the electric perspective, they're the second lowest in the nation from an affordability perspective as share of wallet. And then when you looked at the combined electric and gas, it's lowest in the nation from an affordability perspective. So we're in a really good place in Colorado from an affordability perspective. Significant investments, certainly, working with commission, that's an avenue of additional requests we made in our current resource plan in terms of providing the longer-term affordability looks. So working closely with our commission and stakeholders on that and that's also part of the wildfire mitigation plan that, that we just settled here in terms of looking at securitization, some of these unique investments we're making to protect our customers and communities. So certainly, top of mind, like you said, it could be a little bit elevated, call customer bills here in the near-term as we work to get that loaded online later, call it, in the five years but certainly something we'll work with our commission and stakeholders on managing that affordability.
Bob Frenzel: The other lens of this is we talked in our prepared remarks about $5 billion across all of Xcel Energy on savings from wind energy and tax credits. Colorado sits in one of the windiest and sunniest parts of the country. We have the ability to make an energy transition there very cost effectively. Our forecast for Colorado was to be more than 80% carbon reduced by the end of this decade, tapping into those great resources. We think that, that footprint allows us to be very attractive in economic developments as well. And when you think about low-cost energy and the attraction to bring economic development, whether it's data centers, whether it's the oil and gas load in the DJ Basin or whether it's new onshoring and reshoring, we think Colorado is a great home for economic development. And as we all know, more sales is beneficial to the broad customer base. So our continued focus on bringing businesses to Colorado, minimizing the bill impacts from an energy transition and from a growth perspective, it's a real focus for the company.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Wanted to clarify is the -- I think you called out 2% to 3% total tariff impact on your investment plans. Does that consider all of the renewables investment as well? And like specifically the AD CVD ruling that we had just recently and the potential increased cost in the solar supply chain.
Bob Frenzel: Hey David, good morning. Yes, we're -- that sort of 2% to 3% is really just focused on our base $45 billion capital plan. And when we think about that over a five-year time period, very modest and manageable. In terms of AD CVD, we do not expect any impacts from that recent AD CVD ruling that came out from the commerce department on Monday. So we're comfortable that, that was well communicated with that investigation, and we took steps with our suppliers to ensure that we would not get impacted by it. So we -- and from so I think longer-term on the wind side in terms of our agreements with our OEMs, we feel good about in terms of managing the tariff impacts on the wind side and the solar side.
David Arcaro: Got it. Perfect. And then just curious on the data center side of things, I think your longer-term kind of data center target or the pipeline level didn't change versus the prior quarter. It sounds like there's been activity though, maybe in the earlier stage pipeline. Is that the right way to think about it, where you've seen, I guess, additional gigawatts coming in the earlier stages? But what -- I guess, what's the cadence of how you would update that more firm pipeline forecast?
Bob Frenzel: Hey David, yes, I don't think it's -- I don’t think we've seen much of a timing in terms of pulling things earlier. What -- we've made really good progress, I would say, with the three that we're working on to sign. And like I said, there's one in each of our states, Colorado -- sorry, yes, Colorado, Minnesota and Wisconsin. But I don't think the timing of it has changed necessarily when I look at it, now if we're signing contracts for those three customers today, they're going to be a little bit backdated in our five-year forecast. So yes, overall, we haven't changed our kind of pipeline. Don't expect us to update that 8,900 until Q3. We'll just do with our normal kind of five-year sales cycle. But the timing, I would call it, is intact what's kind of within the next five years and what we expect to bring on.
David Arcaro: Yes, got it. Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Anthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning, team. It's just -- it's really nice calling Investor Relations and not hearing into Sandman in the background.
Bob Frenzel: He's probably listening, Anthony.
Anthony Crowdell: I know. I know. I know. I know. So how to make fun of them. Just one clarification, one question. I think it was to Durgesh's question earlier, on a new cause related to the Marshall Fire. I just apologize if I heard correctly, is a plaintiff claiming the cause of the fire was a UFO hit your wire and the wire fell and caused the fire?
Bob Frenzel: The cause -- so what I said was there are two theories introduced by the plaintiff’s experts in their reports that they submitted. And that was their language that an unidentified flying object or something hit our lines and our lines -- again, our lines did not fall to the ground. We had one line that came off of the insulator, but we had no down power lines, but that was the theory that they put forth. And the other theory was that piece of partially unattached telecom equipment hit our line. So those are the two theories, but you are correct in terms of how I phrased it in that first part.
Anthony Crowdell: Got it. Okay. And just if I could circle back, I think, Bob, you talked on it earlier on coal plant retirements. You highlighted just years of planning. I think you I think you maybe have scheduled maybe one or two plant retirements this year, maybe Comanche. Just thoughts if you go -- I assume they're still on schedule? Just any clarity you could provide to that?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. So the way I think about it is we probably have a coal plant a year through the balance of the decade. This year is the second unit at Comanche I think the unit, Anthony, is probably 60 years old, 50 to 60 years old. And so our expectation is at the end of the year that, that unit shuts down along with its sister unit, which shut down two years ago. And that's the plan, and we're working towards that. And when you think about the renewable build-out in the Colorado Power Pathway that is underway in the state right now, that's the reliability replacement for that unit that is retiring at the end of this year. So we work with our states for years, including sometimes almost decades on the transition plans. We've been incredibly successful in maintaining reliability. As Brian commented on, in particular, Colorado, one of the lowest electric bills in the country, while we've done a significant transition away from coal in that state, and we expect that to continue.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate you taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. What impact do you see from the potential new Texas legislation related to wildfires in terms of its impact to your mitigation plans and the future in Texas?
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, can you be a little bit more specific which piece of legislation that you're talking about because there are several pieces of legislation that are out there?
Ryan Levine: Yes. So there's a few bills being proposed by Congressman from your service territory around different ways to reduce risk to your service territory related to both private E&P land in terms of whose jurisdiction would be under and then a few others around mitigation plans. I don't know if that had any implications for CapEx or risk reduction for the company.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Let me start and then Brian can opine. But first of all, we feel really good about where our system resiliency plan, conversations went with stakeholders in Texas and unanimous settlement on that program is going to allow us to make hardening investments into the state that we think are important. The legislation that's gone going -- there's probably two that I talk about. One is around pole inspection programs and having more of a state law around that. I think we're generally supportive of pole inspections and pole inspection programs and reporting compliance with those programs. That pole inspections are generally operating expenses go through regular rate cases, and I don't think it's a material impact on the capital side for the business. And the second is more around wildfire liability and the opportunity to submit a wildfire management program and then having it done so in compliance with that program, you'd have an affirmative defense against civil lawsuits on liability side. So we think both pieces of legislation could be valuable. I don't think it leads to significant investment. I think that's largely being done through our SRP, which again, is under a unanimous settlement and looking for commission approval later this year.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Ryan, there's two more pieces I can touch on. Yes, there is some legislation that is really directed to the oil and gas lines. And then there's other legislation that we certainly support is more around kind of Texas improving their state firefighting capabilities. That's around funding for firefighting aircraft, funding for rural volunteer, firefighting departments, new emergency management facilities, things like that, which we certainly support. But overall, if I think about our system resiliency plan and the investments we're making, whether it's in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota, it's all about protecting our customers and communities. And that's how we think about the plan that we put forth is really protecting them in this legislation, we don't see it having an impact on how we think about the risk and how we protect our customers in terms of the investments we're making.
Ryan Levine: Thanks. And then in terms of tax credit transferability, have you discussed or previewed the credit implications for different transferability iterations with the rating agencies and how they may view the implications as it's more of an industry-wide issue? Any color you could share around how different decisions may be interpreted from your credit metrics?
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, we -- our annual meeting with the agencies are in September. Again, we think anything happening the transferability or having tax credits without transferability is a very low likelihood. So if certain -- if something happen, we certainly would have a conversation with them. But again, overall, our conversations back in September were good conversations, but didn't focus on this, which you think is a low probability outcome.
Ryan Levine: Okay. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller: Ryan teed up a little bit on Texas. That was my question. But on a little different perspective here. Obviously, a lot of headlines, a lot of talk about the power generation side. And given your different regulatory framework, I'd say outside of ERCOT, what's your take in terms of as there's more uncertainty around the rest of the state. Does that either impact you? Does it give you an advantage of attracting demands? Any kind of implications there as there's more and more uncertainty on the power generation side, demand forecasting outside of your area in Texas, if that makes sense.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Travis, the way I think about it, and Bob kind of alluded to this with the AQ studies, we have a significant amount of demand already. And that's a little bit a kind of point towards the RFP we have in flight right now. We've -- that RFP we have implied is between 5,000 and 10,000 megawatts of new generation in that upper end, that 10,000 megawatts is really to serve the -- our oil and gas customers with the demand we're seeing there. And again, I mean, that's -- so from our perspective, we have a significant amount of demand without even considering what's happening in the other parts of Texas. So our focus is on ensuring we can serve our current customers and potential data center load that we're seeing from it. So I would say we already had robust demand there even before any impacts from, call it, the other parts of Texas and if any entities want to locate in SPP territory.
Bob Frenzel: And just -- hey Travis, I don't know if your question was aimed at the risk side. I mean the interconnectivity between ERCOT and the Southwest Power Pool is relatively de minimis, and it's through D.C. tie. So there's no contagion risk, I would say, operationally between those two systems.
Travis Miller: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. Anything in the state legislation that's going on, again, outside of what you were discussing earlier with system resiliency and wildfire, anything in other -- those other bills out there that would impact you directly at all, again, kind of the power generation focused stuff.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. So I did talk about wildfire legislation in Texas. We also had similar legislation in North Dakota as well, which we were buoyed by. I think the only thing I'd comment on really that's broad on the generation side is really the continued trend and support for nuclear more broadly across the country and in our states; we've gotten nuclear siting legislation in both Wisconsin and North Dakota. And then in Colorado, they changed the law to recognize that nuclear accounts as a clean energy resource under their calculations for carbon-free generation. So not surprising, there's been a national trend towards nuclear as a preferred form of generation. We think it's years out into the next decade before nuclear becomes certainly, SMRs become likely across the country. But with data center loads and other large load growth across the country, you could see folks looking at even large-scale nuclear facilities again, to serve some of this big load.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. Well, Sanjee [ph], part of that real quick. Texas policy in terms of nuclear, do you have a stance either way?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. So look, Texas has been broadly supportive of nuclear. I mean I think they want a big piece of the nuclear supply chain and whether it's from R&D or manufacturing of large components to wholesale manufacturing of SMRs to the implementation onto the grid. So as a state, Texas has been pro nuclear for a host of reasons. And of course, we would support that as well.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks so much for the time.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Travis.
Operator: Thank you. As we have no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel, for any closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy 2024 Year End Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Roopesh Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Roopesh Aggarwal: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2024 full year results and highlights, provide updated 2025 assumptions and share recent business and regulatory updates. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. Some comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. As a reminder, we recorded a charge of $0.06 per share in 2024 related to the disallowance of replacement power costs, associated with an extended outage at our Sherco plant in 2011. Given the outage occurred 13 years ago, and non-recurring nature of this item, this charge has been excluded from full year ongoing earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings for 2024 were $3.44 per share, while our ongoing earnings, which exclude this non-recurring charge, were $3.50 per share. All further discussion in our earnings call will focus on our annual ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosure in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you, Roopesh, and good morning, everybody. At Xcel Energy, we know that economic growth and prosperity of our communities, and country depends on our ability to deliver energy to our customers, when and where they need it. While keeping their bills as low as possible. And in 2024, we delivered on another year, of solid operational and financial progress to that end. Across our eight states, we invested more than $7.5 billion to build and maintain infrastructure that, supports our customers' energy needs in areas like advanced technology for a smarter, more reliable grid long-haul and regional transmission, to support customer growth and system reliability needs, and carbon-free generation to continue our pursuit of a cleaner energy future. We navigated considerable headwinds during the year, and posted ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share, delivering within our guidance range for the 20th consecutive year, one of the best track records in our industry. Our long-term performance is attributable, to our committed team at Xcel Energy, you show up every day on behalf of our customers with safety, affordability and reliability as their top priorities. I recognize this is the first time, we've been below the midpoint of our target range in over 15 years. We made decisions in 2024 to make investments to improve resiliency, and protect our customers throughout the year. And we coupled with December weather that was considerably warmer than normal, and little time to adjust, the result was earnings at the low end. But because of the operational improvements and investments we made in 2024, we remain confident in our ability, to deliver on our 25% guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. The midpoint of, which reflects 7% growth from the midpoint of our 2024 range. And over the next decade, we expect to invest significantly in our infrastructure to deliver reliable, resilient and cleaner energy for our customers, as well as serve significant forecasted customer growth. Our five-year base capital plan, delivers rate base growth in excess of 9%, and should deliver long-term EPS growth in the upper half of our 6% to 8% guidance range. At Xcel Energy, our long-term strategic model and value proposition, is to make smart capital investments for the benefit of our customers, which improve reliability, resiliency and sustainability, provide excellent customer service and to keep bills as low as possible for our customers. In 2024, we reached several important milestones towards these goals. In November, Phase 1 of our Sherco's solar project started commercial operations, two additional phases will come online in 2025 and 2026. And once complete, Sherco's total capacity of 710 megawatts, will make it the largest solar facility in the Upper Midwest. And by using existing interconnection from our retired coal unit, we save customers money and accelerated deployment, by several years providing opportunities to serve new customers, including multiple data center projects on and around the Sherco's site. We're also near completion of the conversion of our 1,000-megawatt Harrington coal plant to natural gas. Which provides essential energy resiliency and reliability to our customers, and will benefit the local community there for years to come. In 2024, our wind fleet achieved availability of 97%, marking our best performance in five years in achieving first quartile benchmarks. High turbine availability ensures our customers benefit from the zero fuel cost resource, and provides production tax credits that keep their bills low. In line with our Minnesota resource plan, the NRC approved a 20-year license renewal for our Monticello nuclear facility. This allows customers to continue to benefit from a critical low-cost, carbon-free energy resource through 2050. One of the keys to energy resiliency and growth is expanding our electrical grid, to ensure that customers have access to the generation resources needed to meet their daily requirements. And I'm proud to say that for the past 15 years, Xcel Energy has been the leading provider of new transmission line miles in the country. In July, we began construction on the final segment of our Colorado Power Pathway project, which started construction in 2023. The power pathway is a 675-mile double-circuit 345 kV transmission loop that will enable Xcel Energy to connect more than 5,000 megawatts of essential energy resources in Eastern Colorado. And in the fourth quarter, the MISO Board approved tranche 2.1 of its long-term transmission portfolio and the SPP Board approved its 2024 ITP portfolio. These two portfolios will enhance transmission systems in our regions, and inter-regionally, ensuring that we can meet customer growth and resiliency needs. Our portion of these transmission projects could result in $3 billion to $4 billion of capital investment in excess of our base plan. We've also made considerable progress to protect our customers, communities and system from the increasing threats of extreme weather that we continue to see across the country. During 2024, we filed an updated wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado, a new system resiliency plan in Texas, and issued wildfire mitigation plans for each of our other states. We've also accelerated a number of risk reduction efforts, including operational mitigation, such as enabling public safety power shutoff, and wildfire safety operations across our entire system and making investments, to better sectionalize and automate these capabilities. Physical mitigations include the repair or replacement of priority one and two distribution poles, across our system in over 600 miles of vegetation management in Colorado, amongst other milestones. We've developed foundational tools, completing comprehensive wildfire risk mapping of our system, and deployment of advanced risk modeling tools like Technosylva. And we've increased situational awareness where in Colorado, we completed installation of 42 AI equipped cameras, and completed the installation of 25 utility coal mounted weather stations, with many more planned across our system in 2025 and beyond. Equally importantly, our customer bills have remained amongst the lowest in the country, is attributable to our thoughtful investments, access to some of the lowest cost renewable resources in the country, and focus on continuous improvement through our lean operating principles. Since 2020, our continuous improvement programs, have generated nearly $500 million of sustainable savings for customers, while improving operations and reducing enterprise risk. Since 2017, our steel for fuel program has saved customers nearly $5 billion in avoided fuel costs, and production tax credit benefits. Our average residential electric and natural gas bills, are 28% and 12% below the national average, with historical growth rate well below the rate of inflation. In addition, we've reduced our residential electric customer share wallet, by 13% since 2014. And with our low energy prices, customers have the further potential to reduce their energy expenditures, by over 40% as they adopt electric vehicles. At the same time, we reduced carbon emissions on our electric system, by 57% relative to 2005 levels, and remain on track to meet our goal of 80% carbon reduction by 2030, proving that our geographic advantage for renewable resources ensures that customers don't have to sacrifice costs, or reliability to achieve sustainability. Looking forward, we are focused in 2025 working to capture the unprecedented opportunities, for growth we laid out in our base capital investment plan, to deliver on our incremental capital opportunities, to advance our clean energy leadership, and to raise the bar on delivering a compelling experience for our customers, in order to make energy work better for them, and the communities we serve. Finally, I'd like to express my thanks to Paul Johnson. Earlier this year, Paul announced his retirement from Xcel Energy after 41 years of service. Over his career, his commitment, his integrity and his acumen have been critical, to the success of our Controller, our Treasury and our Investor Relations programs. He has mentored countless programs inside the company and across the investment community. I consider Paul more than just a cherished colleague. He's become a personal friend. I know you will all miss him, as will I. I want to extend my sincere appreciation to Paul, his wife Renee, their two sons and two dogs, and we wish him nothing, but the best in his retirement. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks Bob. And I think everyone in this room certainly echoes your comments above, Paul. So let's turn to starting with our financial results. Xcel Energy had ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share for full year 2024, compared to ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the year, include the following: outcomes from rate cases and riders increased earnings by $0.87 per share, and higher other income which increased earnings by $0.16 per share, due to interest income on cash balances, and the gain on debt repurchase that we proactively used to offset increased spend, on our wildfire risk reduction measures. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.40 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges net of AFUDC debt, decreased earnings by $0.24 per share, driven by increased debt levels upon capital investments, and higher interest rates. Higher O&M decreased earnings by $0.13 per share and other smaller items combined, decreased earnings by $0.11 per share. Turning to sales fourth quarter and full year weather adjusted electric sales increased, by 3% and 1% respectively, driven by increased C&I load in SPS and residential sales in PSCo. For 2025 we continue to expect full year weather adjusted electric sales to increase 3%. Shifting to expenses O&M expenses increased $96 million in 2024 reflecting actions we took to reduce future operational risk by increasing investment in wildfire mitigation. In addition, we experienced increased costs from generation maintenance, damage prevention and storm response. We also made progress on a light rate case calendar. In our Minnesota electric rate case, interim rates of $192 million, were approved effective January 2025. And in North Dakota, we filed an electric rate case and the commission approved our settlement in our natural gas rate case. Moving to 2025, we're looking to several milestones, as we make progress on adding 15,000 to 29,000 megawatts of generation, to replace retiring capacity and serve load growth. In the first quarter, we anticipate a decision from the Minnesota Commission on our RFP an IRP settlement. The RFP includes 720 megawatts of company-owned firm dispatchable resources. The IRP includes an additional 4,200 megawatts of generation needs. By summer 2025, we expect to file recommendations for up to 3,500 megawatts of this need across three RFPs. In the second quarter in SPS, we anticipate filing recommendations for 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of generation from our RFP that is in flight. And finally, in the third quarter in Colorado, we anticipate a commission decision on our resource plan for the 5,000 to 14,000 megawatt resource needs, with RFPs to follow in late 2025 or early 2026. We're excited to execute on the significant opportunity and look forward to working with our stakeholders, to drive economic growth for our communities, and continue our clean energy leadership. Moving to our five-year sales forecast of data centers, we have already signed contracts for approximately half of our new data center capacity included in our five-year sales forecast. These projects are under construction, and will begin energization late this year. Additionally, we expect to have executed contracts for the remaining amount that is included in our five-year sales forecast by this fall. We are in active discussions with several counterparties, and look forward to bringing on these large customers that will drive economic development, and benefit to all of our customers. Given our large backlog of additional opportunities, we are confident in our long-term sales forecast. Additionally, we continue to see significant growth in other parts of the business, particularly in the oil and gas region in SPS. As a reminder, our data center growth represents only half of our 5% long-term sales growth that we are projecting. To help fund our $45 billion 5-year capital plan, we issued nearly $1.4 billion in forward equity in 2024. This issuance significantly reduces financing risk, helps maintain a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, and funds accretive growth for our customers and investors. We also continue to make strong progress in the Smokes Creek wildfire claims process. We've resolved 113 of the 199 submitted claims, which we continue to view as constructive. We have committed $73 million in settlement agreements, of which $35 million have been paid. There is no change to our estimated liability of $215 million, as we described in our disclosure. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Xcel Energy posted ongoing 2024 earnings of $3.50 per share, navigating significant headwinds, and meeting guidance for the 20th consecutive year, one of the best track records in the industry. We continue to lead the clean energy transition, while ensuring safe, clean and reliable service and keeping customer bills as low as possible. We are focused on reducing operating risk in our system from extreme weather, including proactive mitigations across our system, our resiliency plan filing in Texas and updated wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado. Going forward, we are excited to make significant progress on our $10 billion pipeline of additional investment opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, using a balance of debt and equity to fund accretive growth. And finally, we are reaffirming our 2025 guidance, of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Nick Campanella: Hi, thanks. Thanks for all the information today?
Bob Frenzel: Hi, Nick.
Nick Campanella: So, I just wanted to kind of get your general thoughts. I know there's been a lot of headlines in the new administration, but particularly around renewable permitting and siting and - are any of your projects kind of in scope from either federal, or private permitting halt perspective? And then, maybe you can kind of also just remind us, what's embedded in the plan from a transferability perspective? Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Nick, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, broadly speaking, when I think about the EOs, they support the energy dominance goals of the administration we're supportive of a broad and all of the above energy strategy. And Brian's comments in the prepared remarks talking about sales growth, and need of our customers for our product, and our electrons would suggest that. We need to move, we need to be able to move very quickly on building our infrastructure, and making sure that we can serve our customers. We know that the administration supports economic development. We know that they support low-cost energy, and while many of the EOs are directed at oil and natural gas, and our focus area is really on the electricity side of the ledger. Look, we support permitting reform broadly at a national, and even state and local levels in order to be able to build the infrastructure, we need to meet this era of growth. We have about 30% expected load growth over the next five years, and making sure that we can deliver on that is important. So any - we think that any of the executive orders and any of the challenges that may be embedded in there today are things that we can always work through. As a reminder, we don't have any offshore wind. We don't have projects on federal lands, and our permitting needs are actually relatively light for wind and solar, and storage assets. So I think, we'll be able to work through it all, and I'm optimistic that our capital plan for '25 and beyond, are going to remain intact, and we'll be able to work with the administration, and all the agencies to make progress here. Brian, do you want anything to add?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Nick, I can just add a little bit of color to that. And there was an article yesterday around the Army Corps and our projects, we do not expect that to impact our projects in flight. And as Bob said, the other projects in flight, we feel comfortable with where we stand, in the permits that we have in our continuing construction, and continuing progress on all our projects in flight. And obviously, with the RFPs once - whether it's tariffs or regulations, or we can certainly look at how that impacts RFPs. But we feel very good about the need and our overall pipeline, and executing on both the stuff in flight and the pipeline. Just quickly, you asked - your other question is about PTCs. We have approximately $700 million a year in transferability embedded in our forecast, right, that's a reduction to revenue, and then we transfer the credits. And so that's been pretty consistent, over the past year in terms of what we've forecasted.
Nick Campanella: I appreciate the answer on that. That's really helpful. And then the - at the end of your prepared you kind of talked about, you do seem to have some line of sight to announce additional customers this year. Just how do you kind of think about the cadence, of pulling in those 8.9-gigawatt customer requests? And at which point, do you think you would reevaluate that sales CAGR? Is that more of an EEI later in the year item? Or just how much of that can actually fall into this five-year time horizon and impact where you are in the 6% to 8%? Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I think expect us in terms of updating capital plans, five-year sales forecast plans, all of that generally is our Q3, earnings release so we can talk about EI. So I expect that all of that be comprehensive update on a regular cadence. Now what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is we expect to be able to signed contracts that will fulfill the - what we have in our base plan for the data centers. And we expect to, we're working actively working in negotiations on several of those, and expect to have them all executed by the fall. So pretty excited about that. And then, yes, as you alluded to, we have a backlog behind that, which we'll turn to working on that as we get through these. And I think that just highlights, the kind of pretty significant opportunity we have. By the time we're doing expect to talk about this in greater detail in the fall is, we'll have a data center in every one of our operating companies. So we have regional diversity, data center diversity, they'll be with different hyperscalers. So we feel really good about the long-term sales prospect. And as we continue much forward, we'll see if there's opportunities to add more, it's not just the demand there. But ensuring that we have the discussions with our stakeholders and commissions about being able to build those assets. I mean you heard Bob say, we need all the above energy strategy. We need to build these. And so, it's really working with our stakeholders, to drive economic development, and benefit for all of our customers.
Nick Campanella: Thanks for all the thoughtful answers today. We'll see you soon.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thanks, Nick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Bob Frenzel: Hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Paul, we will certainly miss working with you, best of luck in retirement. Maybe just if we could touch on the wildfires a little bit here, just given national headlines recently, it seems like developments in other states might have impacted Xcel trading recently. I'm just wondering what thoughts you could provide here incremental as far as the outlook, the possibility for federal wildfire policy changes. Any views from D.C. here, just in conversations within Colorado as well, just trying to get some color there?
Bob Frenzel: Hi, good morning Jeremy, it's Bob. Look, obviously, the California fires were a tragedy for that community, and it does bring a both a federal and a state highlight, to potential solutions there. And we're going to work at both levels through EI largely, at the federal level and then obviously, across our states for anything we can do to continue to protect our customers, and our communities from that kind of threat and that kind of risk. I'd say the dialogues, are active across the federal government and at the state level. Obviously, at the federal side, there's a lot going on. I think a lot on TCJA, IRA and items like that. So I think any wildfire movement, and the federal level is probably a back half of the year, kind of efforts and focus. But California certainly put a bright light on the issue and national problems, the national solutions. And I think there's a big role, for the federal government here to help setting standards, helping with insurance backstops, getting to functional markets, both on the insurance side and on the capital market side, as you alluded to. So I think there's a big role for the federal government here. On a state basis, we're having great conversations, Texas, Colorado, the Dakotas, around everything from roles of the companies. And roles of the states and how are we going to set standards for forestry, how we're going to set standards for building infrastructure for operations and making sure that there's a clean line of responsibility, for who's doing what to make sure that we can protect our customers, and our communities. I don't have anything to talk about that's advancing right now, but we're early in legislative sessions, and maybe we'll come back to you in the first quarter call.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And just going to D.C. at large, is there anything else? I know you talked about a bit with Nick there, as far as changes you think going forward, especially as it relates to, I guess, transferability, is there a need to go through the federal government in any way? Do you see anything changing there?
Brian Van Abel: Jeremy, you just broke up in the very first part of your question there. Why did you say, I got the last part.
Jeremy Tonet: Just about any changes on D.C. I know you touched on it a bit there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Certainly, we're working very closely with our policymakers around D.C. Obviously, one of the things we're not in working is around the IRA, and what happens through legislation. And certainly, as we see it now, I think what we're hearing is that they're going to attempt to do one bill, but if that was on a split into two. I think you've heard me speak before, is we believe the key tenets of the IRA are intact. When I say that, I'm talking about tax credits and transferability, they kind of go hand-in-hand. And so, we feel good about that. I mean it is - there's an incredible amount of jobs in manufacturing, and economic benefit being driven by there, right, which is primarily going into red states. So I think, there's a recognition of that. So we feel good about where that stands overall, and we'll just watch a play out and continue to be plugged in.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And just the last point there, does transferability go through the federal government? Or is it bilateral?
Bob Frenzel: So I think the permissibility of transferability, is definitely embedded within the IRA. I think the transferability themselves, is a bilateral contract with us and any other tax paying entity, yes and I think that persists.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, that's exactly. We negotiate directly with our other companies. We have a number of Fortune 500 companies in our backyard here in Minneapolis that we partner with. The one caveat is co-ops municipalities that use direct pay would go directly with the government, but we don't use direct pay. We're using transferability.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And if I could just finish up on D.C. real quick here. The new administration is more of a focus, I think, on gas and maybe there was in the past in - at the same time, resource adequacy has been very much in focus. And just wondering your thoughts on adding incremental gas fired generation, to meet higher-than-expected load growth. Is that evolved in any way based on what's coming out of D.C., or just higher growth expectations and have conversations, with large C&I customers changed on this side as well at all?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. So Look, we - I made a comment in my prepared remarks about, sort of the real advantage we have across our eight-state footprint, and the ability to deliver low-cost energy, with wind and solar and that persists. And so, we think that those are very valuable asset classes for our customers. They're very important for our hyperscaler and data center customers, who are trying to have their own sustainability goals, and we think that persists. We've been clear that we're going to continue to focus, and achieve our 80% carbon reduction, by the end of the decade. But we've been clear since, we made that announcement that we need dispatchable resources, to support that. So gas has a real role to play, in our active resource plans right now, we've got CT builds in the Upper Midwest, in Colorado, and in the Southwest. And in our resource plans that are on the come. We also have incremental gas resources in there. They're all combustion turbines. So we think we need peaking resources, and we don't think we need baseload gas, because of our advantage in wind and solar, and our ability to deploy solar and storage. But we will have new gas across our systems. They'll have low capacity factors. We've talked about having them clean fuel capable at construction, and other items to make sure that we can meet sustainability goals in our states, but we will have new gas coming, and we are converting some of our coal stations to gas as well. So increasing importance for gas in our footprint, but a maintenance of a real sustainability footprint as well, given our geographic advantage.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. Thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team. Thank you guys very much. And Paul, it's been a real pleasure, I got to say?
Paul Johnson: Thanks.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got absolutely. Are you kidding me? So guys, let me talk a little bit about '24 and '25 quickly. I know we've talked about some of the bigger picture items here, but coming back to, obviously, as you say, a little bit out of the norm for you guys historically on '24, some items that, as you say, you were trying to deal with through the course of '24. But in addition here, when you look at the '25 drivers there's a few items that net to, I suppose, up to $40 million negative versus the prior kind of bits and pieces here, if you will. How do you think about where you're positioned on '25 and getting "back on track" and what I mean by that is back on track relative, to what you guys have consistently delivered in terms of within your – within, or at or above your midpoint level?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. I can provide a little bit of color. I think on face it adds up to that, but I think you got to look at the property taxes, are offset in regulatory mechanisms. So that doesn't have an impact, and I look at some of the other offsets. It's probably less than half of the impact that you quoted. And so, when I think about 2025, we feel very comfortable with where we sit. It's early in the year. We always target midpoint of guidance. So I expect that we deliver this year, like you said, last year was a little bit of an anomaly for us. But overall, I feel very comfortable with 2025, and there's just some other offsetting stuff in there that gives me that comfort.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, right. So bottom line, back on track, '25 onwards here. I appreciate it. And I don't want to work with you guys too much, but you guys have made several times your confidence in the sales growth outlook, you made it in the prepared remarks, you said it in the Q&A. At the same time, how do you think about the backdrop here, when I think you guys dropped the sales growth number from the slides itself, I can't discern is that - was that purposeful? Is there some sort of update coming at some point here? I just wanted to kind of, ask you to elaborate. Maybe I'm nitpicking too much?
Brian Van Abel: I think you might be reading into that too much, Julien. And I mean, generally, we talk about our five-year sales growth on the Q3 call. I mean you just heard me reiterate it. In 2025, our 3% sales growth is unchanged. We feel good about that. So there has been no change. I mean, basically sitting here, what we wanted to do, is give a little bit more context in the data center growth. Because that's about half of that 5% and the fact that we already have three signed contracts in construction. All three of those plan to energize later this year. We expect to deliver the rest of that contract, or the capacity that's in our base sales forecast by this fall, and we're in active negotiations exchanging term sheets right now with multiple counterparties. So that's where - so I think you might be reading into it a little bit, but our 2025 sales growth is unchanged and our outlook, five-year outlook is unchanged. And I think I'd just add - I said this in the opening remarks is plus only half of our load, is from data centers in our five-year sales forecast, having this diversity of growth is also a benefit to, I mean we continue to see very strong growth out of the oil and gas sector in the Permian and Texas in New Mexico. So overall, hopefully, that helps with a little bit of additional color with how we feel.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Well, thank you guys very much. I'll leave it there. All right. We'll talk soon. We'll talk to you on the third quarter call on that sales update.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Julien.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, good morning. I'll wish you a final's call. So just, I guess, just one other thing on the data centers that I can't recall the 8,900 megawatts pipeline, is that - did that - is that number the same as before? Did that go up? And just maybe on that topic, just a little more on the tone of conversations, any shift in the last few months.
Brian Van Abel: You'll see that number is unchanged. We just provide additional color into kind of that what's included in our base, and what we have contracted already. So we didn't change that top side. We have a lot of discussions. But the question around tone, I guess you could you bring this back to DeepSeek and what we're hearing. So we had discussions with a number of hyperscalers post DeepSeek. And some of the common themes, is the efficiency gains were expected. It didn't catch them off guard and DeepSeek was focused on training and not inferencing, where we really think the long-term growth is going to be. And then in all of our discussions with the data centers, these active discussions around the ESA is, there is no change in tone. There is no slowing down. So absolutely not. I think that's why we feel really good about where we are relative to the data center. So as you'd expect us to be, we are in contact with a lot of them post that news, and just given the reaction it had on, or the impact it had on our industry. So - but we feel good about the growth line going forward.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just a quick numbers question. SPS, I think, was basically flat on the year, despite all that growth. Is that just regulatory lag?
Brian Van Abel: We actually had a wholesale customer load roll-off that started last year. So you saw the full annualization of it this year is one of the bigger drivers of it. So that will get captured going forward.
Steve Fleishman: That's right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two quick follow-ups on a couple of the topics we've hit on so far. First, just on the data center comments. As you sign those remaining contracts that are in the five-year plan by the fall, is that something where we should expect to see any sort of announcements around those transactions, or investments to support those facilities? Or is that something that more will happen in the background?
Brian Van Abel: Hi Carly, good question. A little bit depends on the counterparty, and potentially the regulatory filing around it. So maybe a little bit TBD, whether there'll be actual formal or not or not. But we're certainly wanting to respect the wishes of our data center customers, depending on how they want to handle this.
Carly Davenport: Got it.
Bob Frenzel: I might just add that there are times that the local economic development teams, are also very happy to have supported the Governor's priorities in our states. And so sometimes, the communities or the state wants to make an announcement, too. So I would suggest that. We may have more to say, as we go through the year, or it might be quiet until we give an update on the third quarter call.
Carly Davenport: Got it. Great. That's very clear. I appreciate those comments. And then maybe just circling back to the wildfire mitigation front. Obviously, it's been very much in focus. Just as you think about the two proceedings on the Colorado mitigation plan, and the Texas SRP. How are you guys thinking about the prospects to reach a settlement in those proceedings? Or do you think they'll go the full way?
Brian Van Abel: I think we're certainly - as we look forward, we'll take Texas first. We've seen the settlement in the SRP by some of our peers in Texas. So we're certainly hopeful that we can reach a settlement. I think it's recognized in Texas by our stakeholders, the importance of wildfire mitigation, and making sure that we are protecting our communities and our customers. And so I think we're hopeful that in Texas. In Colorado, we'll just start to engage. We haven't received any testimony yet. We'll receive answer testimony from our stakeholders here later in Feb, should be next week. I think, late next week. And then there's a settlement deadline. So that's the deadline to watch April, mid-April is a settlement deadline in Colorado. So we'll start to engage those conversations, and certainly hopeful we can reach a settlement. But certainly, we're comfortable going through this, given the importance of this plan, the significance of this plan going through hearings in a decision deadline, which we would expect at the end of August from the commission.
Carly Davenport: Great. Thank you so much for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hi team, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just maybe March so far, that's where I want to start. And then, I'll go back to a big picture question. Just what's the latest there? Obviously, the trials start in September 2025. What should we be tracking between now and '25? Could there be sort of a settlement, or some sort of a resolution between the parties - maybe just latest thoughts there, please? Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Hi Durgesh, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, there's not a lot going on a lot of changes in the Marshall proceeding. As you indicated, the trial is set for September and the judge reaffirmed that recently. And as we indicated in the fourth quarter, we have made some decisions, the presiding judge has made some decisions around the structure of the trial. We'll do a liability-only trial in September and if necessary, subsequent trials around damages. And so not much has changed. I guess the only new news out of the judge is probably the venue decision that, he made was going to keep the trial in Boulder County, as opposed to the adjacent county Jefferson, which is there was a venue change request. So not much going - not much new there. And again, back to your second question, which is really around settlement and settlement opportunities. As we said previously, we disagree with the share support, and the source of the second ignition and are prepared to defend that in the trial in September.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks, Bob. And then one big picture question on tariffs. Obviously, you have a very sizable renewable investment in the plan, and the China tariffs are now in effect. So if they're going to be sort of there for a prolonged period of time, how are you thinking that impacts your plan, how you're derisking your supply chain? Your thoughts there, please? Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hi, good morning, Durgesh, and thanks for the question. I mean, I think the China tariffs were probably well communicated. And it's not as though we haven't dealt with tariffs before, there was tariffs under the previous Trump administration. We had tariffs under the Biden administration, AD CVD investigation. So something that we've gotten pretty familiar with in working with our suppliers and the manufacturing in terms of whether there's manufacturing capacity outside of China or just ensuring we're making the right procurement decisions to deliver the best possible price to our customers. So I would say the China tariff is not unexpected and not surprising and as you would expect, given our forward-looking nature and all the renewable stuff having in flight that, we had planned for something like that, and have taken the appropriate actions.
Durgesh Chopra: Awesome. Thank you. And Paul, we will miss you greatly. All the best. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Anthony Crowdell: Hi, good morning. I don't know if we go that far, but yes, congrats Paul. Thanks again. Just I guess two quick questions. I wanted to follow-up on Steve's comments, I guess, more on the tone of the data center. I'm just curious if we can contrast the tone between maybe customers, associated with the data centers and non-data centers. I mean is there more of a sense of urgency, with maybe data center customers to hook up? Or do you see it's the same across whatever customers are coming to you?
Brian Van Abel: Anthony, you mean like other C&I or oil and gas or just…
Anthony Crowdell: Exactly. Yes.
Brian Van Abel: I mean I think from the data center side, it is certainly always speed to market continues to be the one of the most important factors, in terms of, can we deliver the transmission generation capacity on the time line that they're looking for. As for other customers, I mean, we continue to see significant growth out of the oil and gas industry. And I think that's probably reflect not probably. It is reflected in the resource plan that we filed in New Mexico in our RFP, when you look at the upside of that RFP in Texas and New Mexico, that is 14,000 megawatts of generation, that's informed by our oil and gas customers in terms of what their electrification needs are. I also think what you saw out of SPP, with the recent approval of this big portfolio of projects, including a 765 kV that is awarded to us and will build. Is that continued growth and our customers are looking to get connected. So I wouldn't differentiate. We don't differentiate between among customers, among customers. But overall, it hasn't changed - the tone hasn't changed with data centers related to kind of their speed to market and how important it is for them.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. And then just on that, if I think about maybe political, or regulatory support that you get with new customer hookups, I'm sure it's great for all the communities, whether it's property tax offsets, or what the property tax would pay, I mean, but I think there's probably more economic development associated, with the non-data center customers. Is that fair to look at it that way, and maybe that they get maybe greater continued regulatory support, or political support than maybe the data centers are actually, as you said earlier, there's no differentiation between the type of customer that's getting hooked up, a hookup is great for regulators?
Brian Van Abel: Well, I think, Anthony, I think it really depends. I mean, if you're talking about a data center that's going to build out to a gigawatt plus of capacity, you have years-and-years of construction jobs. And then, they may be doing other development within the community, support the community's significant property tax base - and it does provide benefit, to all of our other customers. And when you're talking about a data center load that large, it does drive benefit for all of our customers. So I don't think it - I wouldn't characterize it that way, because the data centers and these large low customers understand that they need to bring economic development, and benefit to all of our customers for us to get it approved in front of the commission.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. And I'll echo much appreciation, Paul, enjoyed over the years, and appreciate all the help over the years. Question on a high level, we're trying to figure out kind of what are some of the constraints really across the industry on some of the big CapEx numbers and the growth numbers coming out. What about labor a lot of questions about equipment, and tariffs, et cetera, et cetera. But what about labor availability, both for you and what you maybe see across the industry? Is that a concern?
Bob Frenzel: Hi, Travis. This is Bob. Great question and certainly one that we're focused on and probably have been focused on for a number of years. We've been working actively with both national and local IBEW's and other trade organizations that we work with, to hire the critical talent that we need, to own and operate these assets. We've been working trying, to give insights into our backlog of capital projects that we need to our vendor partners, to make sure that they know where our growth is coming from. And so our job is really massively in terms of partnership with people, who help provide us the human talent that we need, to do this big build-out. Now that gets pressured by other people also needing talent. And so, we are in constant competition for human capital and talent, both at our vendor side, and for our company talent as well. So it's a great question. I think we started the process. There's more work to do there. Everything from funding programs in developmental, senior colleges and technical colleges going into high schools, and recruiting at that level, trying to get folks that may want to bypass the university, and go straight into a trade or a craft. So any and everything we can do to make sure that we've got the human capital, to make sure that we can do the build-out that we need.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just specific on the data centers, Apologies if I missed this in many of the comments, but do you anticipate any specific regulatory filings, for any of the customers either you have signed, or you're working with, or just thinking about something that might need such a big build-out that, you need some kind of preapproval or approval?
Brian Van Abel: Travis, yes, we would likely expect - we haven't disclosed which states that we're negotiating with these customers on. But yes, we'd likely expect that we would seek regulatory approval. And that's a little bit back to my comment of the data centers understand for us, to get regulatory approval, it's got to show benefit to our current customers, and benefit kind of the communities.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Brian Van Abel: So well, with that, I just want to lastly echo Bob's comments around Paul retiring, you can tell he's in the room with us for one last time. He's been a mentor to me, a mentor to many of us in this room, and a close and personal friend to me, ever since the 15 years that I've been at the company. So thank you again, Paul. Roopesh, welcome to the first earnings call. We look forward to many more going forward. So with that, I'll wrap up. Thank you for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call your lines will be on listen-only. However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, President, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory updates, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2025 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings releases and SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. In the third quarter of 2024 Minnesota Commission disallowed $46 million of replacement power costs associated with the extended outage at our Sherco plant in 2011. As a result, we recorded a charge of $35 million, or $0.04, in the third quarter, which was in addition to an $11 million, or $0.02 charge, that was accrued in the second quarter of 2024 related to that matter. Given the nonrecurring nature of these items, both charges have been excluded from third quarter and year-to-date earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.21 per share, while our ongoing earnings, which exclude this charge, were $1.25 per share. All for the discussion in our earnings call today will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosure in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities and we enable a future power by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, and we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $2 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging conditions, and we accelerated our wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've provided – we've been a leading provider of wind energy and with our filed resource plans we expect to stay in that position. We've delivered on our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in the industry and looking to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation, new and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our community's vitality. We've deepened our commitment to serve and support customer needs efficiently. For example, since 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved almost $0.5 billion in O&M expense while improving operating outcomes and reducing risk. In addition, we've kept our O&M costs significantly below the rate of inflation over the last 10 years. And our Steel for Fuel strategy has delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. And finally, this discipline, alongside support of state and federal policies enable us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well under the rate of inflation. We're $0.16 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, and we are initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share. And today, we're introducing our updated 5-year $45 billion capital investment plan, which centers on four key areas. Clean Energy, which continues investment in generation that provides customers with a secure and clean energy future while helping our states and our customers meet their ambitious policy goals. Customer electrification, which helps customers electrify their transportation needs, transitioning homes and businesses away from fossil fuel heating and converting fossil fuel loads to clean electric power loads. New load growth, which expands our electric system to support customers surging demand and requirements over the next decade and beyond and safety and reliability, which modernizes and hardens our system to ensure continued safe operations and address increasing risks from severe weather. There's a lot of focus across our industry and country regarding data centers. Xcel Energy has nearly 9,000 megawatts of opportunities in our customer pipeline before 2030. The scale of this pipeline gives us the ability to thoughtfully negotiate agreements that deliver the energy and capacity needed to important new customers in the region while protecting Xcel Energy and its customers and ensuring lasting relationships with our data center customers, ensures that new data center load that's brought onto our system benefits all customers. It drives load growth to our increasingly decarbonized energy system, generates economic growth in vitality in our communities and delivers on the national imperative to support a domestic data center industry. As a result of these guiding principles, we anticipate we will secure contracts with about 25% of this pipeline in the five-year forecast period. We also expect these opportunities to continue to grow and the need extends well past the next decade. We previously signed data center agreements with Meta and QTS and completed land sales with entities, including Microsoft to support new facilities. In October, a new data center customer completed a land acquisition in our service territory, and we're in the final stages of signing service contracts with that party. Turning to the supply side of the equation, we continued progress during the quarter on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We reached a settlement in our Upper Midwest resource plan. And as part of that settlement, 720 megawatts of company-owned natural gas CTs and battery investments were selected. In addition, the agreement reflects the need for an incremental 4,200 megawatts of wind, solar and storage a portion of which is included in existing RFP solicitations. The settlement is pending a decision by the Minnesota Commission, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025. In October, we made a new energy resource filing in Colorado called the Just Transition solicitation. Our projections indicate the need for up to 14,000 megawatts of new generation to meet the phase out of our coal plants to accommodate increasing demand from data centers and to achieve state and customer emissions goals. We anticipate a decision on that filing in fall of 2025 with RFPs to be issued in early 2026. And we're working on our solicitation and SPS which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewable and firm dispatchable generation. These are due in January of next year, and we expect commission approvals in 2026. Protecting our customers from the threats of extreme weather also remains a top priority. In August, severe thunderstorms brought heavy rain, hail and winds of over 60 miles an hour to customers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Xcel Energy employees and contractors safely and promptly restored power to over 250,000 customers who lost service during those storms. We're thankful for the dedication of our employees and contractors that ensure that our communities continue to have safe and reliable service that they expect from Xcel Energy. In addition, we'd like to thank our crews who've worked tirelessly to provide mutual aid assistance to other utilities to support recovery and restoration efforts from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton. And regarding wildfire risk reduction, we continue to make progress on our accelerated wildfire mitigation efforts as well as our Colorado wildfire mitigation plan filing. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate filing our Texas resiliency plan, which will include wildfire mitigation in the Southwest. Finally, turning to a tradition that I'm very proud, during the third quarter, nearly 2,200 volunteers from Xcel Energy in our communities took action to support nonprofit organizations during our 14th annual day of service. Volunteers dedicated almost 8,000 hours to support 125 projects for nonprofits across our eight states. We're grateful to the thousands of volunteers and nonprofits that come together year-after-year to put good energy into action that fuels growth influences change and lifts up our neighbors. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results, Xcel Energy had ongoing earnings of $1.25 per share for the third quarter of 2024 compared to ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: outcomes from rate cases and nonfuel riders increased earnings by $0.25 per share and higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investments and other items increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Turning to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales increased 0.2%. However, third quarter weather adjusted sales increased 1.3%, based on our forecast, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of a 1% increase in weather-adjusted electric sales. Our new five-year plan includes 5% per year electric sales growth, of which approximately 50% is from data centers with other growth coming from the oil and gas industry and EVs. Our sales forecast only assumes contracted or high-probability data centers. We also large data center – we also expect that large data center low growth will continue beyond our five-year plan, and there is upside to what we have included. Year-to-date, O&M increased $58 million, primarily driven by increased generation maintenance, damage prevention, wildfire mitigation and storm expenses. In addition, we are facing increased costs from our recent excess liability insurance renewal. As such, we are revising our full year O&M forecast to 3% to 4% increase relative to 2023. During the quarter, we also made progress in several rate cases. Earlier this month, the Colorado Commission completed deliberations on our natural gas rate case, which reflects an estimated rate increase of approximately $130 million which includes $15 million of incremental depreciation that was not included in our original request. The decision was based on a historic test year with an average rate base and a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, reflecting an ROE range of 9.2% to 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52% to 55%. Rates will go into effect in November. In early November, we plan to file a Minnesota Electric Rate Case, seeking a rate increase of $490 million over two years based on an ROE of 10.3% and a 52.5% equity ratio. We’re also requesting interim rates of $224 million to go in effect in January of 2025. The final decision is expected in 2026. We continue to make progress in the Smokehouse Creek wildfire claims process. We’ve settled 86 of the 179 submitted claims, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome, 23 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimated accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for this fire. Shifting to our investment plans, we provided an updated $45 billion five-year base capital expenditure forecast, which reflects annual rate base growth of 9.4%. These investments are critical to serve growing electric demand, meet clean energy goals and ensure system safety and reliability. We have an additional $10 billion plus pipeline of potential investment, which we view as conservative and could be significantly higher. This additional capital reflects generation from RFPs and resource plans, low growth from data centers and beneficial electrification and additional transmission, including opportunities from MISO Tranche 2 and the Southwest Power Pool. We also refreshed our base financing plan which reflects approximately $19 billion of debt and $4.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It’s important to recognize we’ve always maintained a balanced financing strategy, which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. As a result, you’ll notice we issued $1.1 billion of equity via our ATM program this year. This equity issuance is not part of our 2025 to 2029 financing plan, and reflects our commitment to credit quality while delivering on our long-term financial objectives. Maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund the clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low. Moving to earnings, we are reaffirming our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. We are also initiating our 2025 earnings guidance range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, which reflects 7% growth from the midpoint of 2024 guidance. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. We are updating our long-term EPS growth objective to 6% to 8% with expectations to deliver earnings in the upper half of the range. The increase in the EPS growth rate reflects our significant investment pipeline and confidence in our financial outlook. We also modified our dividend growth objective to 4% to 6%, with the expectation to be at the low end of the range. A lower dividend growth rate allows us to retain additional cash flow to fund growth and lowers equity funding needs. In addition, that will lower our dividend payout ratio over time, which provides greater financial flexibility and drive power for the future. With that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We reached a settlement in our Minnesota resource plan and filed our latest Colorado resource plan, which allow us to lead the clean energy transition, ensuring customer affordability and reliability, while driving economic growth. We continue to make progress on our wildfire mitigation plans, which reduced risk from extreme weather. We announced an updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We provided a balanced financing plan to fund accretive growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. We are on track to meet our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance and have provided 2025 guidance consistent with our growth objectives. And we revised our long-term earnings growth to the upper half of the 6% to 8% objective range and dividend growth to the low end of the 4% to 6% objective range, which is indicative of our significant capital investment pipeline. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my quesotins.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning, Nick.
Nicholas Campanella: Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask, you talked in your prepared remarks, you had a customer make a large land acquisition. Where was that exactly? Was that in Minnesota, or could you provide more details on that? And then is that included in this 5% kind of consolidated load growth outlook long term for the company, or is that pressure higher? And then how do we think about rate design there? I know that’s a lot in one. Thanks.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Nick. Good morning. Undisclosed customer, but yes, it was in Minnesota. And that’s one of the, call it, as we think about high probability loads. We’ve been, as you can imagine, in active discussions with them and significant progress on services agreement. So, great to see the continued progress we have on the data center front. And so I mean, we’re getting into as part of the negotiations, you get into rate design and in terms of pricing, but I think, it’s important as Bob laid out the guiding principles and how we think about it and ensuring that all of our customers benefit from these large loads that come on, sort of help drive economic growth for our state, but also benefits all of our customers. I think it’s just something I’m not sure if people caught it, but there was a planning session at the Minnesota Commission on Tuesday that included the data centers, IBEW, Department of Commerce, us, and other significant stakeholders, talking about how do we support and move faster on the data center front. And so, we’re pretty excited about those conversations. It’s not really constructive and look forward to working with our commission on these opportunities.
Bob Frenzel: And Nick, just to answer, I think, probably part two of a three-part question was, is it included in our forecast, so we’ve got about a quarter of that 9,000 megawatts are included in our five-year sales forecast. This land acquisition would be one of the projects that would be a part of that forecast. Obviously, we think that this is a trend that’s likely to continue in our regions for a lot of reasons, and we have real confidence in our ability to meet that forecast as well as to continue to see sales growth transition into our regions over time.
Nicholas Campanella: Hey, that’s great. I appreciate that. And maybe a one-part question. But on the financing, I know you’ve priced the $1.1 billion, are you done for the year? Would you derisk the five-year plan at this point? And what’s the right mechanisms to do that in your mind? Thanks
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, thanks for the question. Yes, as you can see, we did about $1 billion of ATM issuance in Q3. So certainly, a very strong quarter for us. And that does fulfill our equity needs for the year. That’s our plan for the year. Now it doesn’t mean that we can’t be opportunistic if we think through the end of the year, we like something, actually, we don’t need to do anything through the end of the year. Second part of your question, look, we view an ATM, and we’ve always talked about this, is it’s an efficient mechanism to get our equity issuances one. But it doesn’t mean we won’t look at all other products and options on the table as we move forward.
Nicholas Campanella: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Can you hear me okay.
Bob Frenzel: We can hear you.
Steve Fleishman: Great. So, just wanted to reconcile the CapEx increase with the equity, because I think, CapEx went up about $6 billion of equity and we went up $0.5 billion. So, it’s kind of a lot less than that 40%-60%. So, is that because you prefunded some with this $1 billion, is that because cash flows just getting better, or just how should we think about that?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Steve, a couple of things, and thanks for the question. One, you’re right. Generally, we guide investors to a 40%-60% mix. Part of that is we do get a little bit of benefit as we lower the dividend growth rate that I talked about that helps a little bit in the five-year, but also gives us more dry powder longer term. But it’s really about kind of the cash flow and the timing of the capital. And if you look at how we design it, when we put together that slide around the credit metrics, our credit metrics are very stable. Generally, still going forward, we expect that 40%-60% mix, but we were able to be a little bit flexible here and not have as much equity as we need it as we roll forward our five-year.
Steve Fleishman: Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then totally separate question, just knock on wood, we’re getting, hopefully, near the end of wildfire season, if it ever ends, and we haven’t seen anything happen. So maybe you could just talk to Bob, maybe just talk to the actions that you’ve taken on wildfire mitigation, how you feel they’re working, what else you might do? And just – and then related, could you just clarify the insurance amount? And are you including deferral of that in your guidance? Or are you assuming you have to expense it in 2025? Or yes, that would be helpful.
Bob Frenzel: Yes, great questions. Appreciate it. I’ve said before, I’m very proud of the activities and the accomplishments that the company has executed to protect our customers and our communities since the March time frame. I think we’ve really built a lot of muscle around our wildfire protection mechanisms. First and foremost is operating the system with safety and so our capabilities in both enhanced power line safety settings and our abilities to execute PSPS is first and foremost in our minds of what helps protect our customers and communities in that process. I think we built a lot of muscle and capability there. Over time, we know that we have to harden the system and segment the system, and we take a lot of lessons learned from our peers in California and what they’ve done in terms of situational awareness, the ability to see whether coming sooner, the ability to alert their customers faster and more confidently in their ability to segment the system, so that the impacts of EPSS or PSPS are mitigated or muted in that process. We’ve been working on the intelligence side of that. We’ve installed AI cameras. We’re starting to look at weather stations, and starting to incorporate other data feeds in this time frame. And again, huge benefits from being a fast follower here to what other people have plowed ground on and learnings that they’ve had over a decade of dealing with this kind of risk. And then with – on the regulatory side, obviously, we’re moving forward with our wildfire plan in Colorado in a system resiliency plant in Texas. All of those will help us to accelerate pole inspections, accelerated replacements of anything that we see out there, more aggressive vegetation management. So I think we’ve done a lot to protect the system in the short-term. And I think our actions as we go forward are going to be very much focused on how we mitigate the impacts on our customers over the long-term and making sure that we have a resilient and safe system into the future.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Steve, I’ll handle that second part of the question around just insurance deferrals. We completed our insurance renewable is this month, premiums are significantly higher as we kind of alluded to in Q2. We saw premiums triple on us capacity did shrink some. So we do have – we have a regulatory deferral docket in front of the Colorado Commission where they have a sudden expedited schedule to get decision by the end of the year. And we’re in discussions with our peer utilities and staff in Texas around the industry issue around increasing excess liability premium. So we do include constructive regulatory outcomes in our 2025 guidance, and that is included getting recovery of our deferrals and constructive cost recovery around our wildfire mitigation plan is an overall part of our constructive regulatory outcomes for 2025.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and for the updates. Maybe just start on the new capital plan, I guess how should we think about the kind of $6 billion capital increase relative to the 40 basis points increase in the rate base CAGR. Is that just a function of base effects rolling forward the plan in other years? Or anything else that we should be keeping in mind there?
Brian Van Abel: No, Carly, you’re exactly right. It’s just a function of rolling forward and having a bigger base as we roll forward to the next five years. So that’s all it is a function of nothing else going on.
Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe to follow-up, just on the 5% new load growth forecast, you mentioned in the slides that being sort of back-end loaded due to the timing of data center load coming in. So is there any other granularity you can provide in terms of sort of when you expect to see that more significant inflection in load and any sense of the magnitude there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Carly, I think if you look at our 2025 guidance, our sales guidance is 3% for 2025 and expect it to go up there to 5% to 8% in the years after that and really peaking in 2020 as we see it and that’s really driven by, like I said, kind of a combination, which is what we view as a great to have the diversity. Half of that sales growth of the 5% is coming from data centers. But we also have significant growth in the oil and gas region in SPS out of the Permian Basin, and we’re starting to see the effects of beneficial electrification around EVs and other BE in Colorado that helps driving kind of the other part of that growth. So I think we see kind of more kind of middle to back end weighted, but also having this diversity in growth is helpful in the overall plan.
Carly Davenport: Great. Thanks so much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: And Happy Halloween. Thank you for all the details that you provided on the call today. Just want to come back to kind of high-level thought process here. Historically, you’ve stuck to the conservative 5% to 7% EPS CAGR with the plus more recently, but noted that there’s all these array of new opportunities that you talked about. And so just wanted to get, I guess, your thought process on moving it to 6% to 8% CAGR at this point. And it sounds like you’re still at the high end there. So I just wanted to kind of walk through that a little bit more if possible.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey, Jeremy, good morning. I think about it in two ways is one, if you just look at our base plan, the majority of that capital is investing in our wires business, right? We’re focused on that kind of safety and resiliency in our wires business, and that base plan drives 9% – 9.4% rate base growth. But then it’s all about the additional steel underground related to the projects we need to deliver on retiring our coal plants, as Bob talked about, and executing on 5%-plus electric growth. So we view that as a tremendous opportunity. We’ve talked – Bob talked about our resource plans in flight. When you add all those up, there’s between 15,000 and nearly 30,000 megawatts of generation we need to add to our system to serve our customers over the call through 2030. So a huge opportunity. And I think the other part is we’ve demonstrated through the RFP process recently, that can be extremely competitive in these generation procurement processes that we have a top-tier internal regulated development team that can bring projects that are very competitively priced. And so we expect to build a now, and I would say, at least $10 billion of those pipeline of projects. And that’s why we’re sitting here very confident about not only the next five years, but longer-term executing at an upper half of the range and potentially going above it.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s very helpful there. So with that last comment potentially going above it, I thought it might be too early to ask there, but I just wanted to dive in a little bit more. I think you talked about three buckets that feed into the incremental CapEx opportunity. Can you weigh out I guess, over the next 12 months what some of the milestones could be and kind of what would it take to move more of that into plan?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So let’s hit the first ones that are more near-term. MISO tranche 2.1, which we should get a decision by the end of the year. Then we’ll need to go through the regulatory approval processes. But that’s roughly about $2 billion of transmission opportunities. We got the SPP, ITP that was just approved by the Board this month. That’s another about $2 billion of projects that we expect to be awarded to us because of reliability-driven projects, meaning that the need is within a few years. So those are kind of the transmission buckets. The SPS, RFP is another big bucket, 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts. We’ll get bids in, in January. And the first look investors will probably get is roughly probably Q2 of next year when we file our preferred portfolio of New Mexico. So that will at least get some insight into that with approvals going into 2026 for that. The Minnesota resource plan, we should get a Q1 decision out of our commission on the overall resource plan, which includes, as Bob mentioned, 720 megawatts of storage and CTs in there, along with some additional RFPs we’re working through. And then finally, related to Colorado. We just filed the Colorado resource plan, which we’re pretty excited about with upwards of 14,000 megawatts in that we’ll work through that resource plan, call it, within a year, and then we’ll file RFPs. So that will be a little bit longer dated on all the opportunities. But you’ll continue to see execution opportunities throughout the next 12 months to 24 months for us.
Bob Frenzel: Jeremy, just to add on to Brian’s comments, I’m really excited. We’re starting to see this energy transition we’ve been talking about and working on for the past five years, really start to accelerate as we start to get to the periods where we’re proactively removing our coal plants from the system and replacing them with cleaner and, in some cases, lower cost generation resources. Brian is right, the development team that we’ve built in-house, starting with our 2017 steel for fuel plan has been an incredible asset for the company. I’d be remiss if I didn’t talk about our transmission capabilities. Obviously, we have a lot of transmission to build in the company and across the country. We’ve been the leading provider of new line miles of transmission over the last 15 years as a company. And with all the projects we mentioned here, whether it’s the Colorado Power pathway, whether it’s LRTP2.0, 2.1 billion the ITP process in the Southwest. We’ve got a terrific transmission development construction team here that are helping us execute on a very strategic asset for the company and the country.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Exciting times ahead. Thank you for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Keep going, I’m super impressed, so thank you. Look, I wanted to follow up on the 6% to 8%. And obviously, the timing here is obviously coincident with an accelerating backdrop on sales growth here. But what does he say about confidence in wildfire outcomes in your mind? Is there anything implicit in the read into this? I mean, again, somewhat of an unknowable, but I’m just curious if there’s anything that you see in a litany of recent developments on that front as well here, if you can.
Bob Frenzel: Look, I'd suggest – sorry, Julien, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First of all, as I think about wildfire current proceedings as well as litigation and long-term outcomes in our states. I feel confident in our wildfire position, both from my comments earlier on what we're doing to protect the customers and the community going forward. as well as our position is unchanged as it pertains to our litigation matters, both in the Southwest and in Colorado regarding Marshall and Smokehouse Creek, long-term, I think we're doing the right things in the system to harden it and protect our customers. There's obviously some investment that's needed there. I would suggest that obviously 6% to 8% is an ongoing earnings number. And if we had an unexpected outcome in any of the proceedings, we'd have to accommodate that. But our position has been – we didn't work – we didn't act negligently in our systems in the Smokehouse Creek. Our accruals are consistent quarter-over-quarter and within our limits of our insurance and we look forward to working through those proceedings and really getting behind us and starting to partner with our communities as we move forward in time with our resiliency plans.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Fair enough, Bob. And actually, just going back to Steve's question for earlier and for the record, I get Jeremy all the time. Just on what we said, you mentioned EPSS and PSPS. I mean these are obviously terms we know well from California. I mean, given – you talked about being a fast forward, how quickly can some of this be implemented, right, in terms of achieving meaningful derisking of the system here? I mean what kind of time frame are you looking at? I mean, it seems like some fairly readily implemented kind of solutions.
Bob Frenzel: So look, I think quickly, and I mean that in a – the – we have the capability to do the PSPS today. We have the capability to do EPSS today as we think – and every single day, we do a wildfire risk assessment on the conditions across our system across all eight states and make decisions on how we position the system, how we set up breakers and how we set up controls. I think probably the difference between where we sit and where some of our peers in California said, is the granularity with which we can do that. Our protection may come at an entire feeder level, which might be a 10-mile long stretch of distribution line. Our goal in the future is to be able to segment that distribution line into much more manageable, maybe one mild chunk instead of one 10-mile chunks so that we can be more targeted with the protections and more protective of customers. So I think as the final analysis is we have great sort of bulk protection systems. And we need to get – I would say, we're working with a sledgehammer today. We need a scalpel in the future, and that takes investments over time. But I think from a true protection mechanism, we've got a lot of the capabilities that we need. It's just a little bit blunter than we'd like.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right, guys. Congrats, again. Nicely done.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just maybe on the – good to see the equity out of the way for this year, strong quarter, Brian, like you mentioned. Maybe just how should we think about the timing of the $4.5 billion that is in the plan? Is that ratable over basically same amount over a year annually or back-end loaded? Just any color there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey, good morning, Durgesh. Yes, I mean I think you've heard us before, we don't necessarily comment on – or give guidance on the timing of our equity, but here's the way to think about it is if you look at the shape of our annual CapEx over the next five years, that's a good way to assume it kind of follows that shape as our annual CapEx is larger in the first few years. So that's how I'd think about it.
Durgesh Chopra: That's helpful. Thank you, Brian. And something that is near and dear to you, the transferability. Maybe just help out what portion of the CFO in the plan is transferability, how are you doing there versus your annual target for 2024?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, we've executed all of our credit sales for 2024, working on 2025 significant demand. And really, it's kind of in and out, right, in terms of seeing give the customer what the offset in revenue and then we used to pick it up on the tax line. So from a cash flow perspective in and out, we've had many discussions about this, I think we lost as leaders in this in terms of the opportunity. Also working with the large buyers of this. It's helpful to have – we have 17 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard here that we know extremely well. And so we're not only looking at 2025, but also longer-term deals and getting the pricing we expected. So I think, overall, we expect we'll be monetizing $700-plus million of credits annually going forward and the markets there, and it's been a great tool to have.
Durgesh Chopra: Thanks, Brian. How much do you do this year? Can you just remind us quickly?
Brian Van Abel: Roughly $400 million to $500 million.
Durgesh Chopra: Thanks so much. Congrats.
Durgesh Chopra: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Fowler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning, Ross.
Ross Fowler: Good morning. So just a couple of things. Maybe winding back to the Marshall Fire a little bit. We saw the judge's order on September 30 on the 25 trial. So obviously, now we're talking a different level of multiplier from that, and we sort of bucketed it in two pieces from what I can tell. So is there any reduction or settlement of claims related to that? Or how do we think about the calendar from here given that, that order is out?
Bob Frenzel: Okay. Ross, it's Bob. Let me try and address what I think your question is, first of all, in Marshall, let's start with, we don't think we acted negligently. We know that the fire was started on the 12 tribes property, the first ignition occurred there, we don't believe we acted negligently in the operation of our system and we dispute the Sheriff’s Report that we called the second ignition. Notwithstanding, obviously, the litigation persists and the structure of the trial was architected in the judge's orders about a month ago. And so the way they've constructed it is, the first trial will determine liability and the issue did Xcel Energy's equipment start a second ignition as part of the process of the overall fire. We'll use a second trial, if necessary, to determine damages and then each individual claimant is going to have to prove up their own damages, and we're not going to have sort of a blanket claim or a blanket number applied to any challenges. So yes, we think that the trial structure was constructive from the judge's perspective. So that's what happened in September. I'm not certain if I answered your question or not.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I think the other part is just that in terms of – I think you're asking a little bit about the multiplier effect where the actual jury would have to hear each award damages and can have a multiplier across all plaintiffs. So helpful. I'll come in that regard.
Ross Fowler: And then next calendar steps, what should we look for as the next sort of thing to watch for here in the process?
Bob Frenzel: So we're in diligence right now, heavy diligence, the trial set for next September for a couple of weeks. So I think we've got a while before there are any real milestones in the trial going forward.
Ross Fowler: Okay. And then you go through in the slides today on Slide 11. You're well below the national average in most jurisdictions on bills. So maybe contextualize, there's a lot of increase in CapEx here and really good rate base growth. Have you sort of laid out what that increase would be the customer builds over the course of the forecast?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think that we sit in a really good starting position, as you mentioned, and it's for a host of reasons, obviously. And as we move forward through time, we actually think the bill impacts are relatively benign as well. We sit in a region that is incredibly advantaged for renewables. And so this opportunity to invest in clean generation and maybe even fractions of the cost that other parts of the country see is really what helps us keep bills low for our customers. But there's a couple of other mechanisms. Obviously, we've been very prudent in managing our operating expenses over a decade and that helps keep bills well below the average. I think we have very proactive and productive energy efficiency and demand management programs, which help our customers manage the size of their energy usage and obviously, the access to lower-cost energy helps along the way. So these are the programs that we think help keep build down. I think probably the best thing we've done is we filed in our Colorado just transition solicitation proceeding, we filed a 20-year plan in Colorado that incorporates all the investment that's expected in Colorado over that period and yielded a customer bill increase of about 2.2% over that long duration. It will be ups and downs from that number and it won't be linear along the way, but we think it's relatively manageable. And we're always looking for ways to mitigate even those types of increases through. Again, very aggressive cost management. Our 1X LNG Way program I mentioned in my remarks, has delivered real benefits and avoided costs to our operating expense line and to our fuel line.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I'd just add, I think that's something we're really proud of. You mentioned Slide 11, but the slide before that around all residential share of wallet is something we're really proud of. Our bills on inflation-adjusted are lower than they were a decade ago. And then if you look at our two biggest jurisdictions, Colorado's second lowest of the country in share of wallet, Minnesota is fifth loss in the country in share of wallet. So we're starting from a really good place too, as we think about the significant investment cycle. So I appreciate the question on that.
Ross Fowler: Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Bob. Great update today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a great update around here. A couple of questions for me. You guys have a couple of settlements in front of the Minnesota Commission. One is the resource plan gas rate case. Any reason to kind of think that some items in those two maybe controversial and caused some delay in the settlement approval?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Sophie, good morning. Let me take first one Minnesota gas case, unanimous settlement, I think, is very straightforward. ALJ recommended approval of our settlement this month. And so we expect the commission decision in Q1, so certainly optimistic that it will be approved. On the resource plan, I think, again, those – a resource settlement with the major stakeholders interveners in that document. I think it really demonstrates kind of our work with our stakeholders going forward, a settlement that not only addresses the resource plan into really an expeditious manner, which is great to see, but also resolves one of our RFPs outstanding. So overall, I think we're pretty excited about the work in partnership with our stakeholders and the resource plan and hopeful the Minnesota Commission, which would be a Q1 event, too.
Sophie Karp: Great. Great. Great. Thank you. And then on kind of like an wildfires, I know industry have been talking for a while about legislative solutions to that. I'm just kind of curious if you have any insight into which states where you operate or other states maybe in the West may take that up and come like session? Is there any kind of data points on that right now?
Bob Frenzel: Sophie, its Bob. From a regulatory perspective, obviously, we think Colorado will take up, and we expect a decision in our wildfire proceeding in August of this year – we, sorry, August of next year. Our resiliency plan in Texas, the commission has been working through those dockets very efficiently. So we expect outcomes in Texas next year as well. On the legislative front, I think that's probably a longer burn candle, making sure we look at the legislation in all the states, I think it's topical for certainly all the Western states as we move through time. I'm not certain, I'd suggest there's a lot of outcomes that we expect in 2025, but a lot of dialogue around how do we protect customers and communities in those states.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I'll just add, a lot of focus on education with our stakeholders and our legislature's partner in Colorado, and we're also working with our pure utilities in Texas on that front in terms of talking to stakeholders on Texas. It's also one of EEI's primary topics and issues that they're looking to address. So very topical for our industry, and we'll continue to work with our states to see if there's longer-term solutions.
Sophie Karp: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Hey Travis.
Travis Miller: I know this is no longer the hot topic, but green hydrogen, I wondering if you had any update on where you all stand. I know that was a big initiative for you at least several quarters ago. Does it show up in pluses or minuses show up in the new investment plan, hydrogen hubs, any updates just generally on the green hydrogen initiatives?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks for the question. You're right. It's sort of been a bit on the back burner for the company and probably for the country as well. We're still seeing progress made in Europe around hydrogen. I saw a big energy pipeline complex get approved in Germany. This has been a big priority for the DOE, and I've been on record saying that the country needs a cleaner molecule. And hydrogen is probably the most flexible one that we've seen. And whether it's used in its pure form as green hydrogen or it's combined with CO2 to make something more like a clean fuel, like a green methane. I think that we're going to need a molecule like that in the country for industrial processes. It has slowed down in its initiatives. We were a recipient of a hydrogen grant with the DOE and that work continues, albeit fairly slowly. And we're still really waiting on regulations coming out of treasury final regulations on 45Q that would be on the production tax credit for hydrogen. So a little bit back burner for us. I still think – I think it's a promising technology. And as you look at the increase in growth that we're seeing across the country in terms of electricity, firming up wind and solar is going to need to happen. It's likely to happen with gas and batteries in the short-term. And over the longer term, maybe a combustion turbine fired on a cleaner fuel is the path forward. And so like we're seeing the acceleration in nuclear R&D, you might see some acceleration in green hydrogen, R&D and advancements in the cost curve because I think the need is going to be higher as we move forward in time.
Travis Miller: And nothing is included in our capital forecast for hydrogen?
Bob Frenzel: Nothing.
Travis Miller: Nothing. Did I hear you, is that right?
Bob Frenzel: Correct.
Travis Miller: Okay. Okay. And then you kind of answered my question, but the resource plans, then it's too early to expect any kind of green hydrogen.
Bob Frenzel: Yes that's correct.
Travis Miller: Okay. Okay. That's all I have. Thanks so much.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: Hey good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Hey Paul.
Paul Patterson: Just back to the, I guess, Ross's question on the rate trajectory, I guess. You guys think you guys mentioned 2.2% in Colorado. Is that over the next few years? That sounds like a long-term thing. I'm just wondering just – I know you guys have a difference in expectation in terms of sales growth and what have you. And I would assume that would offset a lot of this over the next few years, is that kind of the area we should be thinking about just rough obviously, it's going to vary. But is that kind of roughly what we should be expecting around your service territories in the next three years or so just in that neighborhood?
Brian Van Abel: Hey Paul, this is Brian. What Bob was mentioning was in our Colorado resource plan, we filed a longer-term rate trajectory that encompasses all of our expected investments over. It was a five-, 10-, 15- and 20-year period Bob was mentioning the 20-year numbers where you had a 2.2% rate growth over that time period, so right in line with inflation. And that included rate base growth of 9%, so significant investment. And that was the retail sales growth of roughly 5% for the time frame helped to offset that, which is really a point is those large loads can help provide customer headroom and bill headroom for all of their customers. And so a good piece of analysis that we included in our Colorado resource plan. I think over the next five years, look it's going to vary by jurisdiction. Over the next five years, we're roughly seeing about a 3% bill impact which we think is very manageable longer-term opportunity as we showed in the Colorado resource plan to have the large – to have kind of customer bill headroom created from the significant growth we're seeing across different industries.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And then just on Slide 9 and the sort of the potential there on data centers. Just could you just remind me what that means? These customer requests and I guess sort of the cadence that we might see in terms of, I mean, just there's a huge delta between the two. Just if you could, I'm sorry, if you could just sort of elaborate a little bit more on that, what that...
Brian Van Abel: Sure. That's – when you think of that as our pipeline of requests that we've actually taken in our – from our economic development team. But then it's – then we – how we get down to the high probability lowered is what Bob talked a little bit about is through publicly announced projects, we signed agreements whether they've acquired land or purchased from us and we're close to signing maybe in the next 12 months. So that's kind of how we bring that down to that 2.6% growth that we include on that slide. What this also demonstrates is if a high probability load doesn't come to a first on, there's a significant pipeline behind it. So not only do we think that's conservative, but we also see this growth extending beyond 2029. We just give you a five-year sales growth number, and we expect that to continue to build in our opportunity where we're focused on is continuing to help serve these data center customers in the long-term.
Bob Frenzel: Awesome. That's the sort of the very specific company answer. I think what you're seeing, though, is obviously big demand across the country. And we know there's double counting in a lot of people's inbound requests as these large loads come looking for transmission and generation service, but it highlights a different need, which is we as a country, we as an industry need to be accelerating our ability to develop both transmission and generation to serve the load that we think is on the come. And on the face of it, it's a meaningful load. It's a little more concentrated. If you can provide it across the entire country, it seems manageable as you get into very specific load pockets, it comes with a lot of need and a lot of speed that's needed. And so we think about a pace and a scale of both investments to meet this need as a company and as a country, and partnerships with our stakeholders and local communities, regulators, legislators coming together to make sure that we can solve this opportunity for the country as we see it. And as you mentioned, rising tide lifts all ships. If we have a higher load factor on our system, that brings the per unit cost down for everybody. And so today, if the country has a load factor in the 40% to 50% with high load factor customers like these with EVs charging at night with other high intensive energy loads, I think that is an opportunity for us to mitigate cost increases across the entire country as we transition both our transmission and generation footprint for the next generation. I'm excited about it. I really am. It's an opportunity that we're going to have to step into very quickly and in partnership with a lot of people and some new people at the table, but I'm excited about all of it.
Paul Patterson: Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. As we have no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel, for any closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, and I will be coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded. And for the duration of the call, your lines will be in a listen-only mode. However, a question-and-answer session will follow-up at the prepared remarks and questions will only be taken from institutional investors and analysts, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today’s conference. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2024 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the company delivered another quarter of solid operational and financial progress. Our long-term business model remains robust. We continue to deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and communities. We enable a future powered by cleaner fuels and a more resilient and intelligent grid. We partner with stakeholders to encourage economic development, we provide products and services capable of meeting our customers' most important needs. In the most recent quarter, we invested $1.7 billion in resilient and reliable energy infrastructure. We delivered earnings per share of $0.54 for our owners. We provided industry-leading storm response and strong customer reliability despite challenging weather conditions for our customers. We accelerated wildfire risk reduction measures to enable safer and more resilient communities. Xcel Energy's commitment to our communities and investors is anchored by our core investment thesis as an integrated pure-play utility and a clean energy leader. For more than two decades, we've been a leading provider of wind energy to our customers, and we were the first US energy company to commit to a carbon-free electric future. We delivered our earnings guidance for 19 straight years, one of the best records in our industry, and we look to make it 20 this year. We have a long-term and transparent growth plan, making investments in clean generation new to and enhanced energy grids and economic development programs to support our communities vitality. In 2020, our continuous improvement programs have saved $400 million in recurring O&M expense, while improving operating outcomes and reducing enterprise risk. Our steel for fuel strategy delivered more than $4 billion in customer fuel-related savings since 2017. This discipline alongside support of state and federal policies enables us to reduce emissions and keep residential electric and natural gas bills 28% and 14% below the industry average and growth well below the rate of inflation. With our 11,000-plus employees commitment to serving customers, we're $0.14 ahead of 2023 year-to-date earnings, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance. During the quarter, continued our progress on our clean energy transition through multiple resource planning and RFP processes. We issued an RFP for 1,600 megawatts of wind, solar, storage and hybrid resources in the Upper Midwest. These are due in September, we expect commission decisions in 2025. We now have active RFPs for over 4,000 megawatts of resources in the Upper Midwest . In Mexico and Texas, commissions approved 418 megawatts of company-owned solar generation that's expected to be in service between 2026 and 2027. And last week, we issued an RFP and SPS seeking 3,100 megawatts of accredited capacity which could ultimately yield more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables and firm dispatchable generation. Bids are due in January of 2025, and we expect commission approval in 2026. Last quarter, I discussed a number of initiatives that Xcel Energy is taking to reduce wildfire risk. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a short amount of time. Since March, we've developed the capability to deliver enhanced daily wildfire safety operations across the enterprise as well as the ability to conduct proactive, public safety power shutoff as evidenced by recent events in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico during threatening conditions. We've accelerated pole inspections, including replacing priority 1 and priority 2 poles across our system. We're expanding visual coverage with our Pano AI-enabled camera system to over 50,000 square miles in Colorado, enabling first responders access to critical information, including precision triangulation and fire locations. And we've accelerated deployment of Technosylva's risk modeling system and expect it to have it operational enterprise-wide by the end of the year. We recently filed an updated Colorado wildfire mitigation plan that integrates industry experience incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies, adds new technology and expands the scope, pace and scale of our programs to reduce wildfire risk. The plan has four primary programs that include enhanced situational awareness, the improved meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous monitoring. Operational mitigations that include enhanced power line safety settings and public safety, power shutoff capabilities, system resiliency through increased asset assessment and remediation, Pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and vegetation management and improved coordination, technology and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders as well as PSPS resiliency rebates. We expect to file resiliency plans with SPS that will include wildfire mitigation later this year and are developing former wildfire mitigation plans for the rest of our states. Finally, we're working with stakeholders at both the state and federal level on legislation to enhance the safety of our communities from evolving weather risks while protecting the financial integrity of companies that provide these essential services. Moving to economic development. We're seeing a material shift in long-term electric demand on our system after several years of relatively flat sales growth. Our current five-year electric sales forecast assumes approximately 3% annual growth. Nearly half of that growth is driven by electrification of oil and natural gas production, electric vehicle adoption, and beneficial electrification, economic growth and increasing customer counts. The remainder of that growth is driven by contracted and high-probability data center load, including previously announced deals of Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado as well as others. We believe this forecast is now conservative, given a pipeline of data center requests totaling 6,700 megawatts by 2030. If all of the data center requests came to fruition, our data center sales CAGR would be over 9%. We continue working through the request and plan on updating our sales and capital investment forecast on the third quarter call. Xcel Energy is strategically positioned to secure economic data center load with high-quality partners due to our access low-cost renewable generation, the availability of water and fiber infrastructure, unencumbered land and our speed to market. At the same time, we'll continue to focus on the impacts to all customers, ensuring we have both economic contracts and system resources to provide safe, clean and reliable power to our communities. During the quarter, there were two regulatory outcomes that provide for cleaner and more resilient electric and natural gas distribution system, First, Colorado passed a bill that enables qualified electric utilities to make necessary distribution investments with timely recover to achieve state policy goals, including transportation and building electrification and enabling distributed energy resources. This was the result of extensive stakeholder process supported by the Colorado Energy office, our IBW labor partners, environmental advocates, NRDC and WRA as well as the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and others. Second, the Colorado Commission approved the modified clean heat plant, which establishes a starting point for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas distribution system. Full year budget of up to $441 million was approved, which sets funding primarily for beneficial electrification and natural gas efficiency. We look forward to working with the stakeholders and regulators to implement these initiatives to meet our long-term sustainability goals in Colorado. Finally, we recently released our 19th sustainability report. We're proud of our history at Xcel Energy. And as we look forward, we're committed to delivering the essential energy services our customers value and need while driving positive change that supports the environment and communities. I'm deeply appreciative thankful for the commitment and hard work of our employees and partners to deliver a clean energy future. We remain relentless in our pursuit of our vision and will continue to deliver long-term value to shareholders an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for the communities in which we live work. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.52 per share in 2023. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: revenues from electric rate cases and riders to recover capital investments combined to increase earnings by $0.26 per share. Higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.04 per share, and revenues from natural gas rate cases increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.04 per share and other factors combined to reduce earnings by $0.01 per share. Turning to our sales discussion. Year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.4% and natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. We're updating our 2024 forecast to reflect a 1% increase for electric sales with expected increases in C&I load in the second half of the year. Longer term, we continue to see robust demand in our C&I sector, driven by data center loads in Minnesota and Colorado, along with oil natural gas electrification and SPS. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on a relatively light rate case calendar. In June, we reached an uncontested settlement in our Minnesota natural gas case, providing a $46 million rate increase based on a 9.6% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. The final commission decision is expected by year-end. In our Colorado natural gas rate case, we received intervener testimony in July. There's a settlement deadline at the end of August with hearing scheduled for September. We expect a commission decision in in the fourth quarter. And July, the Texas Commission approved our $13 million distribution rider request. This represents our first distribution rider requests in Texas, and we expect it will allow us to reduce the frequency of future rate cases. We also continue to make progress on the claims process for the Smokehouse Creek wildfire. We've received 141 claims, of which 43 have been settled, which we view as a positive and constructive outcome. 21 lawsuits have also been filed. In addition, there is no change to our estimate of our accrued liability of $215 million. As a reminder, we have approximately $500 million of excess liability insurance coverage for the fire. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 19 years. We're executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability and resiliency economic development to support our communities. We're proactively enhancing our wildfire mitigation actions to manage the risk to our systems to protect our customers from extreme weather. We remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with the wildfires, if I could, and risk mitigation there. How do you think system risk stands now? How do you expect it to, I guess, improve over time with the wildfire mitigation plan, is were kind of even across the system? Or are there certain parts in focus? And then finally, it seems like there's some fires in Colorado right now. Just wondering if any of your equipment was involved in any way?
Bob Frenzel: Yes, I appreciate the question. Look, as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm really proud of what we're going to accomplish on the operational side to provide the real-time risk reduction that we need today to give us the time to make the necessary enhancements and system resiliency and hardening for our system over time. Clearly, we're further ahead in Colorado. We just filed our second wildfire mitigation plan, and we've been working on the first one for over four years. But that shouldn't be taken as anything other than a huge focus that we also have in Texas and in Mexico around our plans there. Our capability to do wildfire safety operations and PSPS exists on a daily basis across the entire enterprise, which drives real-time risk reduction. We're benefited as a company by all the hard work of the people that have come in front of us in California. We expect to dramatically reduce our wildfire risk based on their experiences and doing some of the lessons learned from all of those organizations. They've been more than accommodating and helping us and others across the country. And clearly, the need is there and evidence, we think there's a real supportive backdrop in our states to help us pursue these necessary investments to continue to risk reduce our business.
Brian Van Abel: And Jeremy, this is Brian. Good morning. Just on the second part of your question about the current fires in Colorado, our assets were more than a mile away from any of those believed ignition points.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s all very helpful. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to pivot here a little bit to the data center opportunity, as you outlined there, it seems like the opportunities are accelerating from when you discussed it with the market. Just wondering if you could frame that a bit more what you're seeing and where across your footprint that's happening? And just any more color would be helpful.
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Jeremy, Bob again. Look, we're really excited about what we're seeing. Obviously, we believe we have a very attractive service territory across all 8 of our states for different reasons in all of them. But when we speak with hyperscalers and other data center developers, we have what they're looking for low-cost clean energy, access to fiber access to water and other infrastructure, human capital, land that makes us attractive. Right now, we're seeing most of opportunities materialize in the Minnesota and Colorado footprint, but our deeper backlog, I would say, is across all of our service territories in all of our states.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Jeremy, I can just expand on that a little bit. If you could pop the slide that we put in our earnings release today, which is updated from the data center slide that we had a couple of months ago. You can see it's a significant increase in the customer requests. As Bob said, the biggest opportunity was in Minnesota, now it's growing. We're seeing significant opportunity in Colorado now and even expanding outside of Minnesota and Wisconsin and South Dakota. And so we're working closely internally with our economic development team. We think about it as we're updating our long-term sales forecast right now, which will roll out in Q3. Our long-term sales forecast right now is in the 2% to 3% range. I would expect that to look more like the 4% to 5% range and our base long-term sales forecast when we roll that out as we incorporate some of these high probability loads into our five-year guidance. Just another good example about how we look to proactively work with our commissions. The Minnesota commission here in Minnesota has publicly stated, they didn't have planning sessions around how do we accommodate and meet this both economic development opportunity for our communities and also, how do we provide benefit to all of our current customers and create more opportunity for investment.
Bob Frenzel: And Jeremy, I think this is part of a much broader theme that I've been talking about as it pertains to our company. If you put those criteria that data centers are looking at today, I would suggest that's true for almost any energy-intensive industry and our view that they're at some point going to overly co-locate in parts of the country where energy costs are lower and green energy could be cleaner, and that sits right across the footprint that we straddle. And so, as you look at stuff like hydrogen and clean energy production, if we get to direct their capture as a means of carbon mitigation, you could see a lot of that headquarter in itself or locating itself in our backyard as well as other manufacturing probably where transportation isn't as critical. I think all of those are economic development opportunities that are not in our forecast but areas that we think should beneficially accrue to the parts of the country that we serve.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Great to hear. Big numbers there. Congrats. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Thanks very much for your questions, sir.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move to Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Bob Frenzel: Hey. Good morning, Carly.
Carly Davenport: Good morning. Wanted to just follow-up on a couple of Jeremy's questions there. Maybe just first on the wildfire front, is there any sort of feedback from stakeholders, you can share so far on the wildfire mitigation plan you filed in Colorado? And then you had mentioned plans to file additional wildfire mitigation or system resiliency plans in other states. Can you just talk about what forms that might take and where you're most focused in the near-term?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hey Carly, this is Brian. It's now early in the process in the wildfire mitigation plan filing in Colorado. We're just starting to see some discovery requests. But overall, we think about the work and the scope we're getting from, call it, the first few responders and the community has been positive. Our investment in the Pano AI cameras is already -- there's been some recent articles where has helped identify fires not started by the utility, but helped work very proactively with the first responders to get them out and mitigate fire risk and protect our communities and our customers. So, I think overall, it has been supportive. But again, like I said, early in the process. Kind of the next kind of pivoting to your second part of the question, is we're focusing on right now is developing our system resiliency plan in Texas, which is what will incorporate our wildfire mitigation plan. So that will be later this year and look for a similar filing in New Mexico later this year, too, and then working through what it will look like in Minnesota in the Midwest for wildfire mitigation plans. We can incorporate a lot of the wildfire mitigation plan into our multiyear rate case in Minnesota as we think about which we'll file in November of this year.
Carly Davenport: Great. That’s really helpful. Thank you for that. And then the second one is just on the load growth in the data center piece. Could you just talk a little bit about your process for working down the request into the pipeline? Or I guess, said another way, what is sort of your bar for including load in that near-term pipeline estimate, which goes into your broader load growth estimate?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So, if you think -- I'll give you a little bit of color. We kind of highlighted on that slide in our earnings deck is one. We have a contract with them, for example, QTS and Meta that's included in our five-year forecast. And then we have something called near-term pipeline which, for example, maybe we've sold a parcel of land to them. And what we consider is 80% probability. So very high probability that it's going to come into our sales forecast within the next five years. And this is working very closely with our operating companies and our economic development team with these customers. And then everything above that, we do not have in our sales forecast. So there's a huge opportunity above what we call 80% high probability load. And so that's a little bit of color. So, as we continue to kind of march through time, you think some of the stuff that we don't view as 80% probability today becomes more of an opportunity and we drop into that what we included in our base forecast.
Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much for the time.
Operator: Our next question today will be coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks guys very much. Good to chat again.
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Julien congratulations, I heard you proud papa these days.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Appreciate that. Absolutely. Guys Nicely done here. I got to say, lots on that pipeline. Maybe to pick up where Carly lifted off here on just kind of probability weighting here. How do you think about that filtering through your processes? For instance, I know you didn't emphasize as much the relative load growth of the SPS, for instance, in the context of data centers. But how do you think about even the numbers that you guys were throwing out there of the 5 gigawatt number getting updated here sort of pro forma for that process that you're working through right now? Effectively, as you probability weight and update with 4Q, how does that filter into the processes you already have in flight for procurement given what seems like a perhaps more pressing need to address the RFPs that would need to be necessary?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, Julien, so I'll start and then Brian can add on. I think you know the company pretty well we've generally taken a pretty conservative approach to forecasting whether it was capital investment opportunities in this case, sales opportunities. Our process is alive and well right now and is geared towards a comprehensive update in the third quarter earnings call. And so we'd expect for, as Brian walked through the sales funnel on Carly's question and then the update on our capital forecast, whether that's the RFP results coming into our forecast whether that's new sales or whether that's capital needs driven by our wildfire mitigation plans, our needs to serve customers to the extent that we see high probability load growth that needs investment as well as all of our resiliency and reliability plans as we roll forward in time. So expect something at the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter from us on a fulsome enterprise-wide look at all the parameters.
Brian Van Abel: Julien, just let me add to that a little bit. If we think about all the RFPs we have in flight, for example, Minnesota. We have multiple RFPs in flight while we're looking at this potential new load that's rapidly evolving. So we have that opportunity as we go through these RFPs and we're in a resource plan filing with the Minnesota Commission, which we provided kind of what call a base view, but also in electrification in a high load view. So we have processes in flight that helps us move quickly on the staff and secure resources and work with our stakeholders, similar in SPS. We just followed an RFP for over 3,000 megawatts of accredited capacity. Now that was based on our resource plan in New Mexico that had a base plan, but also a high electrification plan working with all of our oil and gas customers. And that's why you see us talking about this 5,000 to 10,000 megawatt nameplate capacity range in SPS because we see that load up there, we're working with our oil and gas customers. So SPS is much more of an electrification in the oil and gas industry. Down there, we're in Colorado, Minnesota, in the Midwest is much more of a potential data center opportunity.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Thank you. And then maybe on the other side of this, nicely done in Colorado on some of this legislative effort here. How do you think about the time line and implementation of that legislation just given the sub 8% earned ROE on a trailing basis, how do you think about that improving said number of 50 basis points or what have you from the legislation here over time?
Brian Van Abel: Julien, and maybe I'll just take a step back and just say this is a really good piece of legislation now supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders. As we think about it, it's really, kind of, how do we help advance state policy around beneficial expectation, whether that's electrification of the transport sector, electrification of home heating and so worked with a very broad group of stakeholders to get support and passage of this legislation. As I think about it, there is a distribution system plan that we'll file in November in Colorado, which is really kind of the basis of this legislation and think of it almost a resource plan for the distribution system above their capacity investments we need to make and how do we think about the different levels of penetration and how it accelerated some of this can be. And so we'll file that in November, work through that. And so there's a -- the full rider will be implemented in 2026 around the investments needed to kind of drive our distribution system forward. And now when we think about from an earned ROE perspective, we've earned about 8% approximately Colorado over the past few years. So this will really help us drive a significant closure of that gap as we think about it as we go through kind of like I said, 2026 when it's fully implemented. But we also have other investments in Colorado as we think about the renewable investments we're making and the transition investments that we're making to help drive state policy and achieve our decarbonization goals of the state that could concur recovery too. And so as those investments ramp up, that will help close that gap too.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. Nicely done guys. Perfectly.
Operator: Thanks for your question, sir. We'll now move to Sophie Karp calling from KeyBanc. Please go ahead, ma’am. Your line is open.
Sophie Karp: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the -- going back to the data centers trend. So I guess is there a point at which this incremental loan growth and the acceleration of sales trends translates into the earnings growth at what point would you be comfortable sort of making that leap?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, as I think about it, right? I mean, I think about this data center opportunity in two ways. One is really getting the contracts right and having the data centers -- having -- adding new data centers provide benefit to all of our customers on the system. And that's really important to demonstrate benefit going to the commission with the contract that demonstrates benefit to our current customers. Now longer term, absolutely, there's an investment opportunity or investment need here to support these customers. These are large loads. And so as I think about it, we're moving through the planning process right now, both from, as I talk about a sales forecast perspective and the high probability loads and how did that translate into our capital forecast. So I expect a broader update from us bolt-on that 5-year capital plan and the sales forecast plan in Q3, and that should help address your question.
Sophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then a more higher level question. With all this new load coming in, and I'm not sure if load is going to be interruptible or not interruptible. But do you see the need for, I guess, more gas-fired generation on your grade anytime soon and how receptive do you think the regulators would be to those types of generation additions? Thank you.
Bob Frenzel : Hey, Sophie, it's Bob. So look, I think that -- great questions. We sit in a resource rich area for wind and solar. We see increasing needs for storage resources. But as evidenced by our most recent and our resource plans, we do have incremental combustion turbines that serve to back up and serve our customers to make sure that we have reliability when the wind or the sun or the storage is unavailable. So in our most recent ERPs in Colorado, our recent resource plan up here in the upper Midwest, we have incremental CTs coming back. And I think with increased load like of the magnitude we're talking about, we would actually see increased numbers of backup generation, almost as an insurance policy for our networks to make sure that we have reliable and affordable energy for all.
Sophie Karp: But no plans to add CCGTs from now?
Bob Frenzel : I'm sorry, can you say that again?
Sophie Karp: No plans to add CCGTs, combined cycle?
Bob Frenzel : No. At this point, we don't have any plans today to add any combined cycles to our network. But I mean, we have to evaluate the probability of real load and what the resource availability is to serve it. So not today, but I wouldn't say that anything is off the table.
Sophie Karp: Got it. thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take questions from Greg Oro [ph] calling from UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks very much. Just regarding -- the you're working your way through the Smokehouse fire settlements. And just kind of how are you thinking about whether -- how those are going in terms of -- are there any groups that are precedential? How do you think about kind of resolving that and moving forward, sort of timing and process?
Brian Van Abel : Hey, Greg, I can provide some color on that. So 141 claims settled, and we're moving expeditiously through those and have already reached settlement on 43 of those claims. And so how I look at it, these claims have spanned, call it, a variety items, everything from homes to agriculture buildings, to fencing cattle, feed, personal property. So it gives us a pretty good data point while so -- well, 43 settled is not all encompassing, but it is a good data point. And I think the important point as we think about it, reassess our liability of $250 million and the claims so far support and help validate our accrual. Another data point, the report that received in Q2 was from the Texas A&M Agralife extension. And that report covered -- it was an economic estimate of the agricultural losses from the entire complex of fires down there. And that report for a value of $123 million agriculture losses. And that report included some very large buckets, cattle, feed, agricultural structures. And so when we look at that report, and that number and what we've included for our accrual, it does support our assumptions. And so that's the latest information we have through Q2, and we'll continue to try updates as we move through time.
Unidentified Analyst: Helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Nick Campanella calling from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Nick Campanella: Hey good morning everyone. I hopped on late, so hopefully I'm not repeating others, but just first, just as you're progressing through Colorado gas, what's the ability to settle this in your mind at this point? Is that something that you're open to? Or is this taking a fully litigated pass? And then I just have one follow-up. Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Nick, yes, we sort of received intervenor testimony relatively recently. We have a settlement deadline of August 27. And we certainly look forward to working with our stakeholders with interveners to attempt to reach a settlement. So, we've reached settlement in the past few cases in Colorado, so we're hopeful that we can reach this settlement, also ready to go through the fully litigated process if we need to, that'd be hearings in middle September and this CPUC decision by the end of the year.
Nick Campanella: That’s great. I appreciate it. And then I guess if I could just ask on the financing quickly. I know you priced a little bit of ATM in the quarter. Is ATM the primary vehicle to use here for the rest of the year in terms of your equity needs?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I mean the ATM will be our primary vehicle. It doesn't mean we wouldn't be opportunistic if there's a potential block. We'll also look at some of the other equity content products as we go through the time. But overall, ATM is our plan. But also I look at where our CFO to debt is at 17%, right. Now we have flexibility, given we have strong credit metrics, and that's why maintain a strong balance sheet as we have flexibility in terms of when we can look at issuing equity.
Nick Campanella: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you, very much. Mr. Campanella. We'll now go to Travis Miller calling from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you. I wonder if there was any update on timing or plans for a Minnesota electric rate case and then tied to that, any lessons learned or takeaways from the settlement in gas case that could be applied to any timing or requests on the electric side.
Brian Van Abel: Travis. Yes, we're looking -- we're planning on November 1 filing for sort of a multiyear plan on the electric side. If you remember, we're in year 3 of our multiyear plan right now. So we've communicated that. As we think about the gas side, no, we always look to see if we're going to reach a constructive settlement with the parties, and we've been able to on the gas side. So I think that's a good data point as we think about it. So early days given that we haven't made the filing yet, but I think November 1 filing, it's longer process in Minnesota. But once we get through kind of the intervenor direct testimony or robotic testimony, we'll certainly look to see if there's an opportunity to settle.
Travis Miller: Great. Okay. Thanks. And then back to the data center, that 6,700 or however much it ends up being in terms of requests and potential, how sensitive is that number to regulatory proceedings, whether it's the planning process that what you're talking about was going on in Minnesota, whether it's rig cases, RFPs, how much sensitivity is that to just all regulatory proceedings?
Bob Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Look, when I think about the opportunity here that's in front of us, our obligation is the company is to make sure that we were able to serve current customers as well as our future customers and make sure that everyone is treated economically and fairly. I'll be honest, we don't have -- we're 21, 22 gigawatt peak load system today. We don't have 6,000 megawatts of capacity available today. We have some, but we would need to, as part of our existing RFPs and resource plans to add more generation to the stack. So that would take a resource planning process and a regulatory process. I think we've proven over the last seven or eight years, our ability to do that and do that with efficiency to make sure that we can address the expanding needs of our customers and states. So we will need generation over time. But I think we have plans and processes that are in place that allow us to speed the market to address the needs that our new customers might need today, as well as the growth that they forecast through the end of the decade.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. And then just real quick, transmission distribution capacity. You talked about generation capacity, is there enough T&D? Or would that also be a constraint?
Bob Frenzel: So largely, these customers are largely transmission customers, so we'll talk transmission grid needs. And we've got, again, some capacity on the grid today to meet their needs today. In all of our jurisdictions, we're expanding our transition pretty aggressively, whether it's through the MISO LRTP processes, up here in the upper US and what's been approved and what's on the comment [ph], as well as the Power pathway in Colorado and other transmission proceedings in [indiscernible], and then our work in SPS with the Southwest Power Pool to build more transmission down there. So I think we've got transmission in flight. Again, the capacity today is available, but not the full extent of the 6,700. So our goal is to make sure the transmission generation needs are ramped according to what becomes our high probability customer needs.
Travis Miller: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you for the questions Mr. Miller. Our next question will be coming from Ryan Levine calling from Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. Any color you could share around rate design for the data center opportunity? In an earlier answer, you mentioned economic development opportunity, does that signal a certain rate structure for this customer class? And on a similar vein, what role do you see VPPs impacting the ability of Xcel services, data center load in Colorado and more broadly across your service territories?
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, you broke up on the second part of your question, but first part of the question seemed like it was around the rate design as we think about these data center loads. So far, we've approached that on a contract-by-contract basis, and so it can be unique. But the principle is that we need to make sure that the revenue that we receive from these data centers covers more than the incremental cost that comes to our system. So what I mean simply is that our current customers are not harmed by adding these. And whether that means you have a provision in the contract, that's a ratchet if they don't deliver on the load they said they're going to deliver or a take-or-pay type contract. So these are fluid conversations, but the principle is that we need to bring something to our commission that is in the best interest of our current customers. And if you wouldn't -- I couldn't catch up. You broke a little bit on the second part of your question, so if you could repeat it, it would be helpful.
Ryan Levine: Sure. What role do you see VPPs impacting the ability of Xcel to service this data center load in Colorado and across your service territories?
Brian Van Abel: Look, I mean I think VPPs can almost be another demand-side management tool as we think about it. So we think there could be a role there. I didn’t know that was part of our distribution legislation in Colorado to do some planning and study work around VPPs. So I absolutely think they can play a role in the future. Just like if you think about some of this potential large load, could you have it on an interruptible load uncertainty period. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, as you think about the overall umbrella of more demand side management tools to address in sort of this significant loan growth that we see in our future.
Bob Frenzel: And Ryan, today, we have almost 10% of our peak load in Colorado is available for demand management tools already. And so we'll continue to work with commission and providers as Brian said, with the distribution bill that was just passed to Colorado. So there's an opportunity here, but we do have a very full demand response program already in existence in Colorado.
Ryan Levine: Thank you. And then, do you have a way of quantifying what percentage of historical Wildfire risk has been reduced or will be reduced by the implementation of the current WMP? And how do you see this risk evolving in the coming years?
Bob Frenzel: I don't think we've got a quantitative number for you today, but as I made in my prepared remarks. As I think about the operational mitigations that we put place, dramatically reduce real-time Wildfire risk in our business. We do this on a daily basis, enterprise-wide, and that affords us the time to go in and then do some of the situational awareness and some hardening and enhanced operational things that we want to do in our system. Today, the tools we have are pretty Blood Tools we'd like to get to more surgical use of those tools overtime. And that's a big piece of what our Wildfire Mitigation plans to is just use the operational tools we got today, make them more surgical so they're less customer impactful overtime.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah. And Ryan, if you run our wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado, we say that the WMP investments and plan will reduce our risk similar to that of what we see in the leading utilities in this space.
Ryan Levine: Thank you for the time.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We do not have any further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to CFO, Brian Van Abel, for closing remarks. Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you, all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We wish everyone a good day. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-24 23:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this conference is being recorded.
 [Operator Instructions]
 Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]
 I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed.
 This morning, we will review our '24 first quarter results and highlights, discuss recent wildfires and our mitigation efforts and share recent business developments. Slides accompany today's call are available on our website. Please note that we changed our presentation. As a result, we no longer refer to electric and natural gas margin. Instead, we'll discuss changes in revenue and cost of goods sold from the income statement.
 Please note that these most fluctuations in cost of electric fuel and natural gas are recovered through regulatory mechanisms and are generally earnings neutral. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Bob. 
Robert Frenzel: Thanks Paul, and good morning, and welcome, everyone. It's been 2 months since wildfires impacted our Texas neighbors and before Brian walks through our financial results, I'd like to discuss the actions we're taking to protect the public and to strengthen our systems resiliency in the states that we serve.
 In February, multiple wildfires were ignited in Texas. And from the outset of those fires, our focus has been on the people, in the communities, and the Panhandle and on the safety and the well-being of our coworkers and their families there. I want to thank all of the first responders, emergency personnel, state and local employees and our own SPS employees who worked tirelessly in support of our customers and our communities during and after the event.
 They provided wildfire response, community assistance, relief services and work tirelessly in the field to restore essential services. I've been to the panhandle and I've witnessed the impacted areas and I can see for the entire Xcel Energy team when I say that we are saddened by the losses, and we will stand with the Panhandle community as we recover, rebuild and renew that area as we have for over 100 years.
 Xcel Energy has acknowledged that our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smoke House Creek fires and smaller Reamer Fire, which quickly burned into the Smokehouse Creek Fire footprint. We assume claims that Xcel Energy acted negligently in maintaining an operating infrastructure. In addition, we do not believe that our facilities caused the Windy Deuce or the Grapevine Creek fires and believe that their additions are caused by distribution lines owned by other companies.
 In an effort to expedite relief and recovery in the community, we've established a claims processes for those who have property or livestock loss in the Smokehouse Creek fires, and are actively settling a number of claims. So far, 46 claims have been submitted. And as on April 22, Xcel Energy and SPS have been named as defendants in 15 lawsuits.
 Based on the most current information, we believe it's probable that we incur a loss due to the Smokehouse Creek wildfire and accrued a liability of $215 million which is offset by an insurance receivable since it's lower than our approximately $500 million insurance.
 Please note that the $215 million loss equivalent preliminary estimate, which reflects the low end of our range and is subject to change based on new information. More information on Smokehouse Creek, please see our disclosures in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q.
 On all utilities we're experiencing profound changes in weather and climate related impacts on our operations. As a result, we must continue to evolve our operations for these unparalleled dynamics. Risk mitigation and system resiliency has long been a priority for Xcel Energy in continuing into the future.
 Our strategy consists of 3 phases: first, immediate near-term response; second, regulatory activities needed to address comprehensive wildfire mitigation and resiliency plans; third, additional state and federal legislation that could be valuable.
 Part of our first phase, we've accelerated risk-reduction initiatives across our system, including accelerating portfolio inspections and replacements as well as operational actions such as proactive deenergizing the lines and adjusting reclosure settings, known as power saving, power shells and enhanced power line safety setting.
 We've been operating under approved wildfire plant in Colorado since 2020. As part of our second phase strategy, we will file updated wildfire mitigation plans in our respective states beginning with an updated Colorado WMP later this quarter. The plans incorporate industry learnings that are tailored to our unique geographies and risk profiles.
 Newly expanded actions include increased vegetation management, accelerating pole inspections, hardening and replacements, distribution undergrounding segmentation and covered conductor programs, transition line hardening and ore rebuilds, enhanced reclosure settings and correctively energizing of lines and situational awareness programs, including weather stations, cameras, and other monitoring software.
 Later this year, we intend to file a system resiliency plan that will include wildfire mitigation at SPS is contemplated under recent Texas law. And the third component of our strategy is to continue to step up our efforts to innovate and plan for evolving climate wildfire risk.
 We know that our ability to enable a clean energy transition and to deliver important products to our customers is predicated on maintaining a reasonable cost of capital, and we believe that proactive legislation in a state and federal level is a potential vehicle to ensure that our customers continue to receive affordable, reliable, sustainable, and safe power service.
 We are doing this alone. We're working across the industry with peer utilities, industry groups such as EEI and EPRI, [ partner ] of Energy, federal, state, and global agencies, first responders, our labor partners, and countless others. While we need to reduce wildfire risk our core operations remain strong and our investment opportunities robust.
 During the first quarter, we made significant progress on our clean energy transition and resource plans. In February, we filed our resource plan for the NSP system, we proposed to add 6,400 megawatts of new resources and extend the lives of our Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear facilities past 2050.
 The proposed plan reduces carbon emissions by more than 80% while increasing customer bills by approximately 1% annually. We anticipate a decision on our proposal by the Minister of Commission in 2025. In New Mexico, the commission accepted our resource plan and proposed approximately 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by 2030.
 We anticipate issuing an RFP for the resource needs this summer. And finally, the Minnesota Commission recently approved our updated transportation electrification plan, and we filed an updated transportation electrification plan in New Mexico in April. We also made continued progress with several economic and commercial development projects.
 In February, we announced that working with Microsoft to bring a new data center to our retiring Sherco coal facility. The proposed data center is positioned to be 1 of our largest customers in Minnesota and is projected to bring jobs and investments to the community.
 In March, Meta broke ground on its previously announced data center that will be powered by NSP Minnesota. Meta will provide funding for new infrastructure upgrades, including transmission lines to support the project, and the facility is slated to open in late summer 2025. Xcel Energy proactively worked with data center developers, communities, and stakeholders across our states to ensure that we can reliably and affordably serve this new demand while providing benefits to our other customers.
 With several additional opportunities in the pipeline, we expect data centers to drive further growth for the foreseeable future. Our employees are at the heart of these many accomplishments. Our team is composed of dedicated and hard-working and courageous employees are committed to serving our communities with safe clean, reliable, and affordable energy.
 For the 11th year in a row, Xcel Energy was honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine, placing 2nd overall amongst the most admired gas electric company's in the country. For the fifth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere. Xcel Energy is 1 of only 5 energy companies in the United States recognized this year. Xcel Energy also joined the Economic Opportunity Coalition, a public-private partnership with the U.S. government, where we committed to allocating 15% of our U.S.-based contract spending in the areas of energy supply, distribution, transition, and clean energy small and underserved businesses by 2025.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. 
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results. Xcel Energy had earnings of $0.88 per share for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.76 per share in 2023. The increase in earnings reflects our investment of approximately $8 billion over the last 5 quarters to improve resiliency and enable clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities.
 The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: the impact of electric and natural gas rate reviews to recover our capital investments increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting lower labor and benefit costs, lower bad debt expenses and gains from a land sale for a data center.
 Non-fuel riders recover capital investment increased earnings by $0.05. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher depreciation and amortization decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs. Higher interest charges decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.01 per share.
 Coming to sales, year-to-date weather and leap year adjusted electric sales decreased by 0.3% and natural gas sales increased by 1.7% as compared to 2023. Please note that we have revised our projected electric sales growth to 1% to 2% for the year, largely due to declining use per customer and timing delays for expansions for some of our large C&I customers. However, we can certainly expect long-term electric sales to grow 3% annually.
 During the quarter, we also made progress on a relatively light rate [ calendar ]. In April, the Texas Commission approved our electric rate case settlement without modification. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $65 million based on the black box settlement which includes an ROE of 9.55% and an equity ratio of 54.5% AFUDC process.
 In our Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, we received intervenor testimony last week. Hearings were scheduled for July and expect the commission decision by year-end or in the first quarter of next year. And in our Colorado natural gas rate case, procedural schedule has been established that reflects intervenor testimony in July, hearings in September and a commission decision in the fourth quarter.
 Please see our earnings release for more details on our regulatory proceedings. We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. In addition, we've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release.
 With that, I'll wrap up with a brief summary. We are proactively enhancing our operational and wildfire mitigation actions, commanded risk to our systems and protect our customers from extreme weather. We continue to expect to deliver 2024 earnings within our guidance range as [ we have for the past ] 19 years.
 We are executing on our capital investment plan, including clean generation, transmission, and distribution to support reliability and resiliency and economic development to support our communities. And we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings growth at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range starting in 2025 and dividend growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% objective range.
 This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 Our first question is from Nick Campanella with Barclays. 
Nicholas Campanella: Thanks for all the information today. I guess a couple of questions to kick it off. You have a lot of resource plan activity going on across SPS and the RFPs seeming like they're coming out this summer. Just how are you kind of thinking about competition for capital within the current CapEx plan now that you're seemingly accelerating some resiliency plans at SPS and NIPSCO maybe you can kind of remind us what's incremental [ versus not? ] And then also just touch on your financing plan and [ it needs.] 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, certainly, Nick. If I go touch upon all that the multiple parts of that question, just please be feel free to follow up. Absolutely we're pretty excited about the upcoming RFP and SPS. We talked about it before seeking a range of generation between 5,000 and 10,000 megawatts combination of renewables and dispatchable firm capacity. And we'll look to launch that RFP in July. It's a little bit of a longer timeline. So I'll help you understand in terms of how -- what's underlying.
 We do expect to file CPCNs in the summer of 2025. So summer of next year with decisions in Q1 of 2026. So that capital really will be kind of in the '27 to 2030 type of spend time frames. So I think [ it was really elongating, ] adding to the sum of the back end over 5 years but elongating our growth opportunities beyond their 5 year and what we're seeing there. So that's how I think about that capital, but really great opportunity and excited to get started on that.
 You touched a little bit on that. Absolutely, we're looking to continue to invest in resiliency and risk mitigation spend. Just want to note, we have about $10 billion in our current CapEx spend around distribution and transition resiliency. But as we look to file our Colorado [ WNP ] here later in this Q2, there will certainly be incremental investment needs related to reducing our real wildfire risk.
 So we'll evaluate all of that within our kind of current normal cadence when we come back in October of this year to provide a kind of roll forward for a '25 to '29 plan, and we think about competition for capital. I think as we sit here today, we're very [ comfortable -- comparable ] with -- I reiterated we'll be at or above the top end of the 5% to 7% range. I think just looking at all the opportunities we have in front of us with rate base of [ opportunities ] above 9%. And we'll let the finance that as we always have been.
 I think it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet and important to keep that going forward. And so we'll look at it financing incremental growth with accretive equity at that kind of 60%, 40% range. So I hope I touched on everything you're asking about. 
Robert Frenzel: I think I'll just add 1 thing on the Brian's comment. I think you asked about sort of relative competitiveness of the company. We would expect to offer in our own development projects into the SPS proposal, and we've proven that we -- with our scale and utility-owned wind and our growing expertise in solar and storage, we think we would be very competitive for some of the generation in Southwestern Public Service RFP process. 
Nicholas Campanella: Got it. That's really helpful. And then I guess just -- and you did hit all the points. To put a finer point on the equity needs, I guess, do you just see really kind of no change to current plans, even with the multiple a little bit lower here? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So the way we think about it, obviously, like I said and reiterated where we expect to be within the growth range. And that takes into account our lower multiple impacts over the past quarter, certainly. As I mentioned, we think about the significant investment opportunities going forward. And it's important to have a strong balance sheet. We try to maintain that strong balance sheet.
 But obviously, you will look at what is that that's on balance sheet gives us to some timing flexibility from an equity issuance perspective. And obviously, we'll evaluate that and obviously, we'll evaluate whether there's potential timing flexibility our own capital in the near term. But I think overall, as we think fundamentally, everything is intact from a long-term perspective in terms of maintaining a strong balance sheet and funding the investment needs for the clean energy transition with equity as we need to maintain the balance sheet. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Fleishman: So just on the Texas fire. You mentioned the legislative report coming out in May. Just what should we expect to be coming out in that? Is that -- who caused it? Or how should we think about what's going to come out in that report, like we focus on? 
Robert Frenzel: Look, at a macro level, I was pretty encouraged by the process we went through with the Texas House and the committee. I think one of the tenets of good risk mitigation is involving all the stakeholders who have a hand in doing that. And I think the committee hearings were a pretty good example of getting all -- mostly all of the interested parties and participants in our [ room ] proactively talking about the issues. And on balance, I think the sessions were productive, still the committee was looking to be prospective and gathering information for future solutions.
 And I think that's how I'd expect to report in May to come out. I think we'll see stuff on recommendations for utilities, emergency responders, proactive things that we're doing in the counties to mitigate fire risk. I think there's already [ tend to say ] for a service report on causation. I'm not certain we see something else from the committee on that. But I think the report is going to be in line with the sessions themselves with constructive recommendations for how to proceed going forward. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the damage estimate that you took as you've noted, I think, in your release a lot of kind of what's in there, what's not in there. One clarification just is how about not punitive damages, but noneconomic damages. Is that in your estimate or not in your estimate? 
Brian Van Abel: I think, yes, Steve. I'll handle this one, and I'll give you [ key helpers], obviously, we'll point to our disclosures. But I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of that $215 million in the lower end of. 
Steven Fleishman: Yes, that was great. 
Brian Van Abel: And here's very large that some of our pockets it includes. Residential properties and related losses, cattle and feed, agricultural structures and fencing, noneconomic damages and then a number of other items. So obviously, this is subject to changes again additional information since we're still early in the process. 
Steven Fleishman: That's helpful. And then just on a follow-up on the question about equity. Just given some of the overhang that's been caused by this, how are you -- are you kind of revisiting like other options of getting equity than just issuing it? Are there asset sales or other things that you might consider? Or is that just not as attractive as just funding with equity? 
Brian Van Abel: Obviously, it's something you'd expect. Bob and I to evaluate in the normal course, what other options are there. I think we've been -- what you've seen from us is that we were a pretty straightforward conservative financing plan from a company perspective. So I don't -- I think right now, that's our current plan of action. I think I've been on record about not at all interested in minority interest sale in the line. So that's our fair plan of action as we sit here today. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then last thing on the data center growth. So just on the facility at the old Sherco site, how was that being served? And then just, Bob, you mentioned talking to a lot of others. Could you just talk to kind of how they're viewing your territory and just making sure you're able to kind of do this in a way that is kind of good for the broader customer base? 
Robert Frenzel: That's a great question. In the conversation and Steve, and it's very topical, both inside the walls of the building as well as around the industry. On your specific questions with regard to the Sherco site, the site get powered with grid energy. And as you know, we're the first company to commit to being a 100% carbon-free electricity.
 So we are a significant importance in the renewable [ knowledge ] system, and they will benefit from all our system actions. More broadly, as we look across our footprint in the company, we think, depending on the operating company, we have really attractive dynamics for super scalers and other data center and high energy use customers. And whether it's very low-cost C&I energy in the Southwest or [ knowing ] weather and high renewables in Colorado or a similar footprint here in the Upper Midwest. I think that we're having conversations across our footprint. And I think we've got both access to water transition infrastructure, land and energy, and clean energy that they find attractiveness.
 So we've got a significant amount of interest from super scalers and others and then look forward to sharing more of that as we develop our forecast. 
Brian Van Abel: Steve, I just want to -- just add a little bit of color to that. I think you kind of hinted that, how do we think about it from a current customer perspective [ build ]? I think as we bring on new data centers and is something we did with Meta and the approval of Meta in Minnesota. We make sure it's a win-win for our existing customers. That's really important as we continue to move forward with this significant opportunity. 
 And I think there's an opportunity there to work with our policymakers and regulators, to help drive economic development within the right context and then also ensuring that we can move quickly because you will need to build out infrastructure both on the generation side and the wire side that can serve some of these significant opportunities that we're seeing over the next 5 to 10 years. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. 
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to continue with the data center question with one more finer point here, I guess, as it relates to SPS, just given the need for power and given the very cheap natural gas in that area, I don't -- wouldn't necessarily think of SPS as a place that would -- data centers would target, but just wondering if what you're seeing there if cheap Power is a draw? Just any thoughts in general? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Jeremy, I think -- I mean, as Bob has mentioned, we're seeing data center interest across all our service territories. And so service are preferred to have maybe a little different point of attractiveness. And then you hit SPS as on the lowest C&I rates in the country. So interest there. But I would say the other significant growth that we continue to see in SPS, and this is really what you're seeing come through our numbers now when you look at the year-over-year growth from the C&I perspective is the oil and gas expansion in the Permian Basin there and [ averaging ] they're doing from an electrification perspective.
 So right now, that's the near-term growth of and SPS with longer-term data center opportunity we're discussing this with some data centers down there. We also have a fantastic renewable resources down there from a wind and solar perspective, a little bit leads to that. When we talk about that RFP coming out in SPS in our resource plan, those are the reason why we have a range of 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts and I'll try the range is ensure that we enable some of the growth that we're seeing. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Certainly, New Mexico, at the low end of the cost curve for production in North America there. So maybe continuing with Texas a little bit more and following up on the wildfires. Just wondering if Texas caps noneconomic damages or just any other details you could provide there? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Right now, there is no cap on noneconomic damages in Texas. There is a cap on [ punitive damages ] this 2x economic damages falls up to [ 750k ] cap for noneconomic. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And then looking forward to the Colorado Wildfire Mitigation Plan filing, there's been some press in the state around recent deenergization in Colorado. Can you speak to the opportunity for sectionalization or other efforts to reduce customer impact? Any other nuances to the filing you could share with us? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. First, I'm really proud of what the team did in Colorado in executing on behalf of public safety during a volatile weather event. As you can imagine, the -- [ because we have the second ] file on our wildfire mitigation plan, it's going to have a lot of continuation of the existing plan and probably incremental areas that we'd be looking for. But as I think about the big buckets of opportunity there, really early warning capabilities.
 We've already sold 21 panel cameras, but I think there's a real opportunity for increased early warning capabilities with AI-powered cameras as well as weather stations in and around our territories and our equipment. Obviously, we have opportunities to improve our operating capabilities in public safety power [ shutoffs ], as well as even the power line enhanced power line safety settings. But we're executing those today, and we're doing a pretty good job. We have more work to do there.
 I think about the third bucket and where your question leads to is sort of asset resilience capabilities and we can continue to expect our poles and wires, replace stuff and maybe accelerating some of that. But I think [ we've also ] system resiliency, and this gets back to [ what ] your comment on sectionalizing. We've done some of that. We have a real opportunity to do that more, both our intelligence at a granular level of weather and what's happening in weather as well as our ability to control our system at a more micro level to mitigate customer impact is a real priority for us in this plan.
 And lastly, given as part of the plan is the public policy opportunity that we might have to protect our customers. So big buckets there, but hopefully, I got to your sectionalizing question as well as asset [ harving ] like undergrounding, covered conductors and other pieces of both transmission and distribution systems as we think about protecting public safety is a priority for us. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful, there. And just a last one, if I could, as it relates to gas cases in Minnesota and Colorado, any updates there that we should be thinking about or conversations with stakeholders and regulators on those cases and how you feel about those cases. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And just I'll get on first, the Minnesota natural gas case because that's probably the one that spurred us along, given that we just received intervenor testimony and the Department of Commerce recommended a $44 million increase of a 9.4% ROE. We have hearings in mid-July, but we'll certainly look [ into this ] opportunity to engage with our stakeholders to see if we've reached settlement, which we did in the last Minnesota gas rate case. So we'll look to engage, like I said, here is our July. So from now until July, we'll look to engage there.
 On the Colorado side, we're still pretty early in the process. We haven't received intervenor testimony yet. The procedural schedule just came out. So for us, it will be that the settlement -- we get intervenor testimony in mid-July. We get opportunity, there's a settlement deadline at the end of August, and then we don't reach a settlement, we'll be hearing in mid-September for the decision in Q4. 
Operator: Our next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. 
Carly Davenport: Thanks for all the details so far. Maybe just on the resiliency plan filing at SPS that you expect in late '24. Can you just remind us of the timing to getting that ultimately approved and when that spend would come into play? And then I guess any early views on kind of the sizing of that potential filing or in addition to the wildfire mitigation piece that you flagged what other buckets of spend do you think will be important there. 
Brian Van Abel: Carly, it's Brian. As I said, we're just looking to put that filing together, it will be late in Q4. So from a timing perspective, you probably into Q3 of the following year for it to get approved. So I think from an overall perspective, I mean, if you look at some of our kind of just distribution spend in SPS and you look at our 5-year capital plan, and what could be [ albacore ]. Obviously, we're currently focus on the Colorado WNP and we'll take a lot of those programs and apply it to SPS, but tailored because SPS is a very different geography than call it Texas is very different geography when we think about what should we be doing to have risk mitigation from wildfire perspective, and so we'll tailor it. But I think we'll give you more color as we get further development of that resiliency plan later this year. 
Carly Davenport: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on O&M, nice benefit during the quarter there. Is that just a function of kind of year-over-year timing? Or is there a potential downside to that annual guidance on O&M being up 1% to 2% for the year? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes, good question. I think from our perspective, really have, as you kind of noted, we haven't changed our guidance for the year-end even though we had a significant quarter-over-quarter change. So I look at it more from where we are from a budget perspective which you don't see. And we're slightly has our budget for the first quarter. But from where we sit, I think it's early in the year, that our goal is just to land within that 1% to 2% O&M guidance range as [ we sit here.] 
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. 
Anthony Crowdell: Just 2 quick ones. One is any major change in the company's cost to ensure the company's operations. 
Brian Van Abel: Anthony. Yes, that's a good question as we think about it. So I assume you're asking specifically about wildfire insurance or excess liability. 
Anthony Crowdell: Yes, I do. Yes. 
Brian Van Abel: I think yes, all our other programs, I would say, are relatively stable or don't have significant challenges. As I think about wildfire insurance and just let's say for the wildfire insurance versus the overall access liability is they are 2 different things. I think this is a very key industry issue, both at the state and federal level. And if you've been following with EEI, this is one of their top priorities this year from a federal perspective.
 In terms of how we think about getting a focus on [ damage ] limitations? Is there insurance backstop or solution at a federal level and think about specific criteria for wildfire mitigation plans in exchange for liability protection. So those are some of the broad buckets EEI, [ you're thinking about. ] Obviously we're thinking about it from a state perspective as we look forward. Our legislation sessions are wrapping up here or have already wrapped up this year.
 So what we will do is we'll look to work with our policymakers in our state's kind of from here for as we think about next year's last session to see if there's any state level solutions that we think about it.
 Now specifically from a company perspective or a commercial insurance perspective, even prior to Smokehouse Creek, we were seeing [ clinical ] understanding that from some of the commercial carriers, they were already looking to reduce their capacity and not just for us but overall, their exposure from a wildfire insurance perspective. And so that's going into the next policy cycle. These are annual renewals.
 So our renewal is in [ tele ] Q4. So we'll give more visibility into it, but I'll give you some -- a little bit of a sense of where we sit today as we have above $500 million of coverage, and we're paying about a $40 million premium for that coverage, and that's total excess liability, including wildfire. But I would expect that covers that capacity to come down and I expect premiums to be pressured, absolutely. So like we -- like I said, we're still a ways away from our renewal. So again, we'll provide more color as we get close to, but that's where we sit today. 
Anthony Crowdell: Great. And then just one last one. I think, Bob, you had mentioned pursuing some proactive legislation for wildfire risk. Would you be willing to let like hey, the maybe top 3 things? Or what are your goals in getting the legislation passed, like what's -- would you like to be included in your maybe first wave of legislation pass, whether it's limits on noneconomic liability? Or I'm just curious, any color on that you would provide. 
Robert Frenzel: Anthony, thanks for the question. As Brian said, this is a big and emerging national issue. And we've seen pressure both on the retail side of insurance, homeowners struggling to get homeowner insurance that protects from wildfire risk, and you're seeing it in the commercial side on the wholesale side as well.
 So we've been active at the federal level, particularly talking about sort of the national opportunity we might have here. I think about there are [ precedents ] at the federal level, you see something like where goods are really important for everybody like the FDIC or FEMA or for flood insurance or other type programs or even nuclear backstop insurance from the price standard [ connect ].
 So there's several [ precedents ] around protecting national goods like banking access, like access to affordable electricity. So as I think about where the federal government could help, is this probably applies to the state level, too, which is having approved wildfire mitigation plan that can be reviewed by an agency of a same or federal level. And then if you're in compliance and current on that plan, then you have access to some form of backstop insurance program that provides protection and maybe access that maybe the current carriers are providing at an attractive or an affordable cost, as that group of entities comes up to speed on risk and risk mitigation.
 So I think those are the big parameters that I would think about. And certainly, there's state precedents, you can take [ UTA ] or Nevada or California laws and seen programs where companies along with their regulators and legislators are coming up with programs that provide more cost-effective backstop for companies to bring down the risk.
 And as I said in my prepared remarks, at the end of the day, we have an enormous energy transition that we need to fund and making sure that our cost of capital is attractive to fund that keeps the transition affordable for our customers and for the country. And so I think it's important that we manage this risk, we manage the financial cost of this risk, and those are some of the areas that I would think are most important for us to go after. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Just to add a little bit to that. I think as Bob talked about importance of that insurance backstop and filling a WNP, but I think there's also an aspect there is if you're following [ the plans of the WMP to the presumption of routes ] which I think is important, too, and also looking at a limit job liability or limit on damages. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. 
Sophie Karp: I have a couple of questions, today. So on the Texas fire, can you clarify how, I guess, the claims system and the litigations that's been filed against you are going to well work together for [ like I have a better word ]. Like are people who are litigating, not filing claims or can they do both? Like how does it work? 
Brian Van Abel: Sophie, yes. I mean, so first of all, I'll talk about the claims process and still early, but we obviously encourage people to submit claims. It was [ 46 ] so far. But how it works is anyone can submit a claim, and when they submit that claim, they don't waive their right to pursue a lawsuit. But if there is a claim settlement, then that absolves or release any other potential lawsuits that they could file.
 So that's how it could work, but also from a -- if someone files a lawsuit, it certainly could be an opportunity to settle through that lawsuit too. So -- but like I said we are encouraging people to enter the claims process, and we've settled a couple already that are in active settlement discussions with others. 
Sophie Karp: Got it. Got it. And then my other question on Colorado and next to the gas got this clarification from the commission there that they want the utilities to pursue non-pipeline alternatives, I guess, for gas in Colorado. Could you comment on that and just sort of how that will impact your investment in that state, particularly with gas? 
Robert Frenzel: Sophie, it's Bob. Look, we've got a number of gas proceedings in Colorado over the last year. I think you're referring to our clean heat plan. And we think that was an industry leading or very unique filing and proactive on the company and the commissions' part to move forward that. Big picture, I think they're sitting, they're looking at the gas system as an effective delivery of energy but making sure that if we've got capacity need from a growing customer base out there that we're looking at something other than pipeline alternatives.
 And we're actively engaged in that and something we've always as a company looked at. But I don't think it's going to affect necessarily us going forward in terms of significant changes in capital forecast for where we sit today. But maybe a more proactive approach with stakeholders and communities about finding maybe different types of solutions to solve the similar issues, whether that's more beneficial electrification, more powering of homes for home heating and other needs. And we're certainly engaged in that process with them. 
Sophie Karp: So the non-pipeline alternative is basically a word for electrification? Or could that be something like increasing like compression station output or something like that? Like just kind of -- what is that? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, so actually, you bring up increasing compression station, it's certainly an opportunity. I think generally it's thought of -- what are the electrification opportunities. Say, there's going to be a new neighborhood builds. What is the alternative, it's -- okay, you saw that [indiscernible] gas and expansion of a pipeline or what are the alternatives from electrification perspective. So that's probably the best way to think about it.
 I think if I were a [ bucket ] out there, and it's a very important project for the governor and the geothermal whether at a district level or a residential level or community level, exploring the possibilities of geothermal in the state are something we're willing to work with or we're going to work with our customers and our stakeholders in the state. So it's not necessarily just electrification. It could be more different forms of heat for homes and communities. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. 
Ryan Levine: What role do you see PSPS having in terms of your wildfire mitigation plans? And are there any initiatives that you could take proactively to gain more stakeholder support to be able to implement that on a go-forward basis? 
Robert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. Certainly, we think of PSPS as a kind of a tool of last resort. But public safety is our priority in making sure that our communities are protected in volatile wind events and wildfire risk case is really important to us as well. So are there opportunities for us to gain more public support, of course, there are. And the ways that we can improve our own performance as we, [ again ] more muscle here, because this is something that I don't love to do. But when we have to do it, I think there's areas of improvement that we as a company have identified and are working with our Colorado Commission to do so. And that includes early notification, excellence in outage maps, something I talked about earlier on segmentation.
 So all this comes as a function of our wildfire mitigation plan. If we have better early warning devices like cameras, weather stations, our ability to effect on a more localized level where the risk is and where the outage would need to can be can get better. But that's going to take some time, some effort, some partnership with our agencies and stakeholders in Colorado for sure. 
Ryan Levine: And then shifting gears on the financing plan as security prices continue to move. How do you look at maybe assessing a time to come to market for capital raises. I think in earlier question, you suggested the avoidance of asset sales, but any color around response to maybe different security prices and how that can impact your financing plan? 
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, I think a little bit as the color I provided before is obviously, overall, we believe our growth plans from an investment perspective, a long-term EPS growth perspective impact and same in our chance of maintaining a strong balance sheet. What I talked about not necessarily in avoidance, but how do we look at the timing of equity and the timing of capital, particularly on the timing of the equity, given that we have a strong balance sheet, is we can look at being flexible there. But I would expect that when we're investing $39 billion of capital at a 9% rate base growth. That does come with the financings. And generally, our prior financing year in and year out, that's aligned with the capital spend.
 So that's the best way to think about it. But obviously, we'll understand what happened to the cost of equity here. And also with the cost of that we have gone off [ over ] the short term in terms of our [ churn ] rates have gone. So but that's factored into all of our plans, as I sit here today and talk about reiterating on being at or above our 5%, 7%. 
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then just last question, in terms of CapEx outlook, given maybe acceleration of infrastructure build-out in North America. Are you seeing any indications that maybe costs will come higher for what's already slated to be built in the coming years. Any color you could share on that? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Ryan, it's Bob. Look, I think as we see reindustrialization, we see data center build-out. Certainly, there can be cost pressures that come from basic materials and construction materials like concrete, steel, and things like that. I think we take our best estimates when we put our capital forecast out, but something we watch pretty closely.
 Labor is another area of opportunity there. I think that one of the things we're very focused on as we see an energy sector transition, making sure that there's a pipeline of talent starting early on in trade schools and partnering with our labor unions and with business partners there, to make sure that the pipeline of [ linemen ] and pipe fitters and welders are capable of keeping up with the demand.
 So we try to send early demand signals to them, and it help them recruitment processes across our territories and really partner on a national level to make sure that we're seeing enough trade come into the business broadly that we don't see a an immense amount of labor pressure. 
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. 
Paul Patterson: Just -- I apologize if you guys have gone over this. But just on the [ NUC ] life extension, could you remind me what the impact financially is. Have you guys already -- it varies from company to company how the depreciation impact is reco -- when it's recognized, et cetera. I was just wondering if you could review that for me shortly, quickly if it's not a problem. 
Brian Van Abel: Paul. Yes, you're referencing the resource plan that we just filed here in Q1 related to the extension of Monticello. So Monticello we already extended to 2040, and we've recognized that depreciation in terms of lower customer bills. So we're looking to extend [ Monticello] from 2040 to 2050. And then Prairie Island both units [ 20 ] years, so we'll go from the early 2030s to the early 2050s. 
 We have not recognized those 3, call it, lower depreciation rates in the customer [indiscernible] rate case. We'll wait until we get through this proceeding to get approval and like we wrap it into our next rate case. So this proceeding is probably going to take 18 months play at the very least. So it's going to be probably [ held before ] we can plow that back into customer rates in terms of lower depreciation. 
Paul Patterson: Okay. Great. But just is there any potential for regulatory -- sort of positive regulatory lag? Or does it -- are you guys planning on having immediately impact customer rates? 
Brian Van Abel: No, this would likely just be captured either how to defer here or likely if we're in a multiyear plan to have a [ true ] mechanism part. 
Operator: Thank you. As we have no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any closing remarks. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. 
Operator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Hosts, you may stay on the line.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-24 23:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy 2023 Year-end Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Paul Johnson: Good morning, welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.
 This morning, we will review our '23 results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory updates and provide updates on our long-term growth plans.
 Slides accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ both anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.
 Today, we'll discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.
 In the fourth quarter, Xcel implemented several workforce actions to streamline the organization, ensure resources are aligned with business and customer needs to ensure our long-term success.
 Xcel initiated a voluntary retirement program under which 400 non-bargaining employees retired. In addition, we eliminated 159 bargaining positions. As a result, we recorded a workforce reduction expense of $72 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of '23.
 Also in '23, we recorded a charge of $35 million or $0.05 per share related to a legal dispute between CORE and Xcel Energy regarding prior year operations at the Comanche 3 coal plant. Given the nonrecurring nature of these items, both have been excluded from ongoing earnings. As a result, our GAAP earnings were $3.21 per share, while ongoing earnings which exclude these nonrecurring charges were $3.35 per share.
 All further discussions in this earnings call will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this, please see the disclosures in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. 
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy continuing to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy while delivering an operational and financial performance.
 In 2023, we executed on the largest capital program in Xcel Energy history, investing approximately $6 billion to improve resiliency and enabling clean energy for our customers while delivering economic growth and vitality for our communities. 
 Our investments in operations enabled ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share, representing the 19th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. Meeting our financial commitments is critical to maintaining a competitive cost of capital, which benefits our customers as we access the capital markets to fund our operations. 
 In December, we received approval for our ground breaking clean energy portfolio with over 5,800 megawatts of new generation resources. This $4.8 billion of new generation investment, which when coupled with the necessary transmission represents almost an $8 billion worth of commitments in Colorado to deliver a cleaner energy economy.
 I'm proud of how our teams partnered with so many stakeholders to deliver on these achievements. And as I look back on the year, we accomplished so many other great outcomes. While the final values aren't in yet, our SAIDI scores improved and we believe we'll be in the top quartile of U.S. utilities for delivering reliable electricity to our customers. Across our wind fleet, we continue to deliver strong net capacity performance and exceeded our corporate availability target for the third consecutive year.
 We navigated a very busy regulatory calendar resolving multiple rate cases and reached a pending settlement in our Texas electric rate case. We filed our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado and our natural gas innovation plan in Minnesota, providing a framework in both of those states to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for our natural gas customers.
 We've approved transportation electrification programs in New Mexico and in Wisconsin, along with updated transportation plans pending commission approval in both Minnesota and Colorado.
 We were partners in over $1.5 billion of awards by the Department of Energy to support the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, wildfire and extreme weather resiliency, Form Energy long-duration energy storage pilots, and additional transmission as part of the MISO SPPC's projects. These grants will lower the cost of these clean energy and resiliency projects for our customers.
 In 2023, we signed agreements for data centers with Meta in Minnesota and QTS in Colorado. Data center and AI-driven demand continued to be a low driver on our system with several gigawatts in the pipeline across our footprint. In Minnesota, we received approvals for an additional 250 megawatts of solar in our 10-megawatt 100-hour Form Energy battery pilot both at our retiring Sherco coal facility.
 We have active RFPs for over 2,000 megawatts of renewable resources across our operating companies, which we expect resolution on later this year. 
 We also filed resource plans in our SPS company, which could add an additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts to our system by 2030. In December, we retired Unit 2 at our Sherco coal facility while continuing the trend of no personnel layoffs at our retiring coal facilities over the past 15 years. We reduced carbon emissions for the electric utility by 53% as compared to a 2005 baseline, on track with our goals for 2030 and 2050.
 All the while, our customer bills remain amongst the lowest in the country. Over the past 5 years, the average Xcel Energy residential, electric and natural gas bills are 28% and 14% below the national average, respectively. And over the last 10 years, we kept our annual residential electric and natural gas bill increases to 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively, well below the rate of inflation.
 We're actively involved in our communities as our employees, contractors and retirees provided more than $11 million and volunteered over 40,000 hours to support charitable organizations across our footprint. We initiated 18 economic development projects for our communities, which are projected to create more than $2.4 billion in capital investments and 1,400 jobs.
 For the seventh consecutive year, we received the top score from Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, the nation's foremost benchmarking survey in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.
 And finally, we received several other recognitions, including being named a top military employer by multiple organizations and one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine.
 We're proud of these achievements, which reflect operational excellence and strong policy alignment, allowing Xcel Energy to provide a valuable product with significant benefits to our customers, our communities, our employees and our shareholders.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. 
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. For the full year 2023, we had ongoing earnings of $3.35 per share compared to $3.17 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.10 per share. This reflects $0.10 of unfavorable weather as compared to last year.
 Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.06 per share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions. Lower conservation and DSM expense increased earnings by $0.06 per share, which is largely offset in lower margins.
 Higher other income increased earnings by $0.05 per share, primarily due to rabbi trust performance, which is largely offset in O&M expenses.
 Lower other taxes, primarily property taxes, increased earnings by $0.04 per share. And in addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.14 per share driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment; and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting our capital investment program.
 Turning to sales. Full year weather adjusted electric sales increased by 1%, consistent with our guidance assumptions. For 2024, we expect electric sales to increase by 2% to 3%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses decreased $47 million or approximately 2% for the year. This is consistent with our annual guidance and reflects management action to offset inflation and other challenges we faced during the year.
 During the fourth quarter, we also made constructive progress on several rate case proceedings. In December, we filed a settlement in our Texas Electric Rate Case, which reflects a rate increase of $65 million; an acceleration of the Tolk depreciation life to 2028; and the ROE of 9.55% and equity ratio of 54.5% for AFUDC purposes. The commission decision is anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.
 In November, Wisconsin Commission approved an electric rate increase of $1 million and a natural gas increase of $5 million based on an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. The decision reflects adjustments for our residential affordability program, updated fuel and purchase power costs and other items, which are earnings neutral. Rates were effective January 2024.
 In November, we filed a Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case requesting a $59 million rate increase based on an ROE of 10.2%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. In December, the commission approved our request for interim rates of $51 million, subject to refund starting this January. Final decision is expected later this year.
 As far as future filings, we plan to file a Colorado Natural Gas Case in the next week or so. In addition, we also anticipate filing a revised Wildfire Mitigation Plan in Colorado in the first half of 2024.
 Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability. We executed multiple contracts in 2023 totaling $400 million. We anticipate executing $500 million of PPC sales in 2024. Transferability reduces near-term funding needs, and most importantly, lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers.
 Moving to our capital forecast. We've updated our 5-year capital plan for the decision in the Colorado Resource Plan, which now reflects an investment of $39 billion. This base capital plan supports investment in renewable generation, transmission to deliver the clean energy and customer-facing investments for a reliable and resilient advanced grid. The baseline results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 9%. Not included in our base plan is approximately $5 billion for renewables and firm capacity associated with RFPs at NSP and SPS and future filings in Colorado.
 We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects the incremental debt and equity financing needs for these investments. Please note that the guidance assumptions in our earnings release have also been updated to reflect changes to the capital forecast for this year. As a reminder, we anticipate any incremental capital investment to be funded by approximately 40% equity.
 It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit metrics and favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, maintain a competitive cost of capital and keep customer bills low, especially in a higher interest rate environment.
 Finally, we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, which we believe is conservative. We now expect to deliver earnings at or above the top end of the range in 2025 -- starting in 2025.
 In addition, we will rebase future annual guidance of actual results. As a result of the significant capital investment opportunities and equity funding needs, we now expect to grow the dividend at the low end of our current 5% to 7% dividend growth range with a target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. This will reduce our equity financing needs over time, lower financing risk and give us even more dry powder and financial flexibility in the future.
 Now I'll conclude with a brief update on the Marshall Wildfire Litigation. The statute of limitations ended in December, and as expected, we saw a significant increase in the number of claims. As of now, we are aware of 298 lawsuits with approximately 4,000 claims. In early February, there will be a hearing at which time a schedule may be determined. We believe the trial will likely begin in 2025.
 With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We're executing on an ambitious investment plan for our customers to deliver clean, reliable energy that investment enabled Xcel Energy to deliver 2023 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 19th year in a row. For the 20th consecutive year, we increased our dividend to investors. 
 We resolved multiple rate cases and filed foundational plans for our natural gas utility to reach its net zero goals. We retired our Sherco Unit 2 coal plant early and reduced carbon emissions by 53% from 2005 levels. We received approval for our groundbreaking portfolio of clean energy resources in Colorado. We updated our base 5-year capital plan to $39 billion, which reflects 9% rate base growth. We have additional capital backlog in all of our jurisdictions.
 We have a strong line of sight to achieving -- to achieve earnings at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. And finally, our electric and natural gas customers have some of the lowest bills in the country, while continuing the safe and reliable service they expect from Xcel Energy. 
 This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator: Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations on a variety of different metrics here. But you guys had already been tracking above the midpoint of your 5% to 7% and given the -- the rate base going up say, 1.5% even with kind of incremental dilution, how do you think about that adding up, right? I mean I'm going to put it back to you a little bit, like how do you think about doing the math there, if you will? And just setting expectations. Obviously, every year might be slightly different here. 
Robert Frenzel: I like the phrase doing the math. I think I might have heard that before. Look, we're really excited about our investment profile over the next 5 years, across our 8 states, multiple asset categories, clean generation, transmission, advanced grid, electric vehicles, everything in support of our customers. Obviously, the EPS growth rate follows the rate base growth with some amount of dilution for financing costs at the parent level. The new updated capital plan is accretive. We expect during this 5-year period to be at or above the top end of our 5% to 7% range. But we think 5% to 7% is still a good long-term growth rate for the company, and that's our guidance right now. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, I'd just add that we do expect -- that's a conservative growth rate. And as I noted in my remarks, going forward, we will rebase off of actual earnings. So important things to note in our script. And overall, as Bob said, we're really excited about it. We're excited about our opportunities and our steel for fuel and the clean energy transition. And I think we're one of the fastest transitioning utilities in the country. And our electric bills are 28% below the national average. So I think we're in a great place for our investors and our customers. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. I appreciate being able to rebase of the actuals. That's certainly a sign of strength, as you say.
 Now maybe just to come back to the timing of equity here. How do you think about that vis-a-vis the updated plan and updated needs? And perhaps just to clarify this, just for the time being, at least this year, no change in that 5% to 7% at least for the current plan here? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Julien, yes, no change and our guidance assumptions for this year is still $3.50 to $3.60. Now there is an increase in CapEx if you look kind of plan over plan this year. But that was really back-end loaded as we work through some of the regulatory approval processes. From an equity perspective, look, we have -- we've said we've been -- we've talked about doing at least $500 million annually through our ATM and expect that ratable over the 5 years. And then we do have some drip. The amount above the $1.5 billion above that, we'll be opportunistic, and we'll look at it. But I think it kind of follows with how our incremental CapEx follows. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then on Minnesota commissioner you've experienced, what's your relationship and maybe a little bit of a brief comment here on where we stand in Minnesota, if you will. 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. No, we've got a long-standing relationship. The new commissioner comes out of the department, and we've been working with him very proactively over years. So we expect a continued strong relationship with the Minnesota Commission. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. 
Richard Sunderland: It's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Can you hear me? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, we can. 
Richard Sunderland: Great. Just picking at the last point on equity. I appreciate opportunistic in terms of timing. Can you speak a little bit more in terms of format of how you might address that I guess, the gap from the ATM to the total needs. Anything on the table at this point or any guardrails to that? 
Brian Van Abel: No, the way we'll -- a pretty plain vanilla way we finance our company. So kind of the base case to be is a block issue. And something you can obviously look at doing a forwards or something. We look at mandatory converts, but our base case is just doing blocks above the level that we feel comfortable with on the ATM. 
Richard Sunderland: Understood. Very helpful. And then looking at a high level in terms of the O&M outlook and then parsing that relative to the workforce reduction announcements. Could you speak a little bit more to the savings there over the near to medium term? How that factors into your overall O&M trajectory and how you're thinking about that O&M outlook, I guess, over the long term as well relative to the work you've accomplished over the past few years. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Let me hit the workforce reduction question first, and I'll transition to the longer-term O&M outlook for us.
 I think from a workforce reduction perspective, us like everyone else faced some significant cost challenges and pressures over the past few years. And so we -- as Paul said, we undertook that to streamline the organization and ensure some of our resources are aligned where our customer needs are and our growth opportunities. 
 So as Paul said, approximately 400 employees are through that voluntary retirement program and another 150 positions were eliminated so that we look forward that generates approximately 2% O&M savings on a run rate basis.
 But we will look to reinvest some of that, as I said, into the growth areas of the company as we look to support our customer needs. But overall, sets us up into '24 that is included and incorporated into our 2024 guidance. As I think about 2024, our guidances were up 1% to 2% relative to '23, but it's really flat to '22 when you look what happened in 2023. 
 Now longer term, you asked about kind of what our longer-term expectations are, we've been managing our O&M with a laser focus on operational efficiency. I think if you look at our IR deck from Q4, we're 1 of 3 utilities that have O&M flat or down since 2015 on the electric operations side. So something we're really proud of.
 And while we look longer term, we have some tailwinds of coal plant shutdowns. We expect we'll be shutting down a coal plant roughly a coal unit roughly a year. We spend a lot of time on technology in looking at how we can leverage technology in our operations in the corporate areas. And then I think most importantly, we haven't talked about this that much as we launched something that we call One Xcel Energy Way which is our continuous improvement engine. We deployed it last year, so we're in the year 2 of it. Really focused on the lean principles and being a transformation engine that is looking at waste reduction and waste elimination. And so that's something we're putting a lot of effort and focus on it and that team reports directly to me, so I'm very involved in it.
 So we think longer term, our goal is to absorb inflation, absorb the, call it, areas we need to invest in from a growth perspective and maintain O&M roughly flat and ensure that we can keep our customer bills low for the long term. So we're pretty excited about it. Obviously, it's not easy but something we spend a lot of time on. So I appreciate the question. 
Operator: Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. 
Durgesh Chopra: Bob, congrats, a solid quarter here to you as well Brian and the rest of the team. Just I thought the dividend growth trajectory change was interesting. You're now saying low end of the 5% to 7% because you have high growth rate. Maybe just talk through your thinking there. You were kind of growing faster, so that gives you more flexibility on the financing side. Just a little bit more color there would be helpful. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Absolutely. So as we look at it, given our significant growth in our base plan, we just added $5 billion of capital to it and that -- the fact that we're guiding to the top end or above our conservative 5% to 7% EPS growth, we thought it was prudent and the right decision to lower our dividend growth, still within our dividend growth guidance of 5% to 7%.
 But as we think over the long term that helped us reduce the equity we needed for this $5 billion of capital. But even longer term, when you look at the compounding impact of a lower dividend with significantly high capital needs it feels like a prudent decision, gives us longer-term financial flexibility and dry powder and reduces financing risks over the long term.
 So we feel really good about it. We feel really good that we have a very good total shareholder return proposition for investors, and we'll continue -- we expect to deliver here [indiscernible] 
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. And Brian, just as you -- there's obviously a ton of CapEx opportunity, you outlined $5 billion additional CapEx. Do you expect -- is that 5% the floor? Or could you -- could the dividend growth be further lowered in case you have -- you're adding more capital to the plan? 
Brian Van Abel: Durgesh, I think we'll assess it every time if we have a significant chunk of capital, update our plans as we do regularly, we obviously evaluate all parts of our total shareholder return. 
Durgesh Chopra: That's fair. Okay. And then just one last one for me is just thank you for the color on Marshall Fire, the additional complaints and other things. Maybe just what are the key steps for us to watch there? And when could we expect updates? 
Robert Frenzel: It's Bob. Thanks for the support as always. With the fire, I think the next sort of milestone I'd say is we have a sort of a trial planning period of meeting first week of February. Given the change in cases and plaintiffs that schedule got moved back a little bit to give new claimants more time. We'll get a better trial calendar.
 As Brian said, we expect a trial some time in '25. Look, we -- after that, we go into discovery, there's not much to do past that. So we'll update everybody when we know more, but there's not much to say other than the facts remain the same on the case and roll the calendar probably to early next month. 
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Fleishman: Yes. So I just wanted to clarify, all your growth rate commentary is that based on the base plan? The updated base plan? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Steve, the updated $39 billion plan. Yes. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And on the -- could you just talk to the PIMs in Colorado and just how you're feeling about being able to manage any -- I guess it could be good or bad, but just any risk exposure from that? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Certainly, Steve, and for the folks that haven't been close to that proceeding. We really have 2 PIMs, which the commission asked to propose a couple of PIMs. So we have a cost to construct and think of that just as a capital, what's our budget for the project has been. And we've operated under those types of things for a long time, whether in Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico, we've had those in Colorado. So we propose a PIM. The commission modified it a little bit, so it's a plus or minus 5% deadband and then customers sharing -- savings and sharing was a penalty or incentive above the 5%.
 Overall, we're comfortable with managing within that PIM. We feel like we put forward good budgets for our projects and knew going in that we would be held to what we proposed given that was a competitive process.
 So we feel comfortable about that. On the operational PIM, again, it's -- the commission modified it slightly but generally adopted what we proposed. That's an overall -- think of it as LCOE PIM on a 3-year rolling average with a plus or minus 5% deadband. And the first 5% to 10% above, it's 80% of the costs or savings you have for customers, the company bears 20%. So if you look at it, we view that's very manageable and appreciative that the commission adopted the PIMs that we -- our structure that PIMs are put forward. 
 So we look forward to working through the CPCNs with commission and then we have the Just Transition plan coming up, which is additional opportunities as we think about transitioning our generation fleet in Colorado. 
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then lastly, just some Washington question. The, I guess, time line, if any, on the nuclear PTC. Your thoughts on the proposed hydrogen rules and what that means for your project. And if you want to take up any thoughts on election risk to IRA. 
Robert Frenzel: Steve, it's Bob. The last one seems like a lot of fun to talk about, but I'll probably pass on that fastball. On Washington, in particular, the hydrogen production tax credit, we were very active, we've been very stalwart in our position that we believe that clean fuels and clean molecules are going to be needed as part of a broader, cleaner energy economy. We felt that hydrogen was probably the most attractive molecule that we could produce in a clean and green way. 
 We are really proud to be considered for a Hydrogen Hub and in our Upper Midwest proposal, The Heartland Hub. But I got to tell you, the 45V tax credit draft guidance out of the treasury was disappointing. It doesn't feel as if we're trying to support a hydrogen economy in the United States. It's going to make it more expensive for our customers, harder to develop an electrolyzer industry on an industrial basis in the country and will slow or stall clean fuel deployment in the United States. We expect to make comments within the comment period. We expect EEI to make comments. We expect other customers to make comments. So I think the treasury is going to have a lot to balance here, strict additionality and hourly matching if it's going to make it more challenging to produce hydrogen at a cost-competitive basis with other fuels. So that's kind of where we are on hydrogen. And I think you asked about nuclear, our math -- go ahead, Brian. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I can just chime in on nuclear. So we expect guidance here in Q2 is our current thinking. Obviously, the guidance we're looking for is how do you calculate the gross receipts, meaning how do you calculate the value. We've got advocated for the use of LMPs, obviously, given that we're in an RTO. 
 Certainly, if you look at our earnings guidance, we have not incorporated that into our ETR. But when we look at kind of the forward curve, we would expect north of $100 million benefit for our customers. So something that we're -- that we provided our comments and hopeful that treasury comes out and favor us because it's a great benefit for our customers. 
 So looking for that Q2. Just a follow-up on Bob's comments on hydrogen. I mean disappointing, the analysis I've seen is green hydrogen now structurally more expensive than blue hydrogen for the next decade and significantly more expensive than gray hydrogen. And so it will depress the development of the green hydrogen market. And so hopeful to get some changes to the final rules. 
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. 
Anthony Crowdell: Just hopefully 2 quick ones if I could follow up on Steve and Julien's math class question. When you think of the 5% to 7%, you're at or above the high end, and that's all in the base capital. What would cause you to get to 6% growth? 
Brian Van Abel: Well, I mean, at or above the high end implies that we're above 6% growth right now. But I take it your question, what would cause us to go to 6% to 8%, if I can interpret it. Like we evaluate it we feel 5% to 7% is the right long-term growth rate. It's conservative and rebasing off of actuals and signaling that we're going to be at the top end or above is the right place to be long term. 
Anthony Crowdell: Great. And then I think you mentioned you're filing a Colorado Wildfire mitigation plan later this year, I believe. Just could you give us a look into that? I mean, is that also a potential for additional capital -- CapEx and then -- or any changes in operation you're thinking once you make that filing? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Anthony, it's Bob. Good to hear you this morning, and thanks for the questions. We're operating under an existing wildfire mitigation program in Colorado right now. And I'd say that, that plan includes asset hardening and replacement. It's got pilots for various technology solutions and risk modeling embedded within that. 
 I think the updated plan that we're anticipating for Colorado would be a continuation of a lot of those existing programs and maybe moving from more pilot to more scale -- or scale deployment of everything from coatings on poles to covered conductor analysis and deployment to enhanced recloser settings and recloser installations across the business, potential for incremental undergrounding in various areas and probably some operational opportunities around enhanced power line settings and PSPs mechanisms. 
 Still working on finals. So I don't think it's going to be a material driver in terms of our capital deployment, but I do think it will be an enhancement to our risk reduction in our Colorado company. 
Anthony Crowdell: And Bob, just lastly, do you -- does that plan have to get approved or just accepted, just a procedure that goes on in Colorado on a wildfire mitigation plan? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. It goes through a regular way of proceeding with intervenor testimony and our testimony [indiscernible] approval by the PUC. 
Operator: Our next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. 
Carly Davenport: Just two quick ones for me on some of the resource plan opportunities that you've highlighted. So first, on Colorado, obviously, strong results on that plan in 2023. How should we think about just the next milestones to watch in Colorado, whether that's around the CPCN process for the transmission or the Just Transition filing? 
 And then just second on SPS. We saw the load growth come in close to 5% overall in '23. So just in that context, can you talk a little bit about the SPS opportunity around the future RFP there to sort of accommodate that level of potential growth going forward? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, absolutely, Carly. Related to Colorado, we'll begin -- so the marker will begin to file CPCNs for all of our projects in transmission starting in likely late February. And then you'll just see them kind of filter in probably over Q2. And then those will be regular way CPCNs, I think probably 8- to 9-month type approval processes on each of those filings. So those are the next markers at least on the projects coming out of the Colorado Resource Plan that was just approved.
 And then we're working on filing our Just Transition Plan in June and that was originally focused on the replacement of the Comanche 3 assets with a little bit of the commission approving No Regrets Portfolio in this December. I think there's opportunity to bring the incremental resources. We do think we need additional resources that we propose and even the commission acknowledges that there may be an opportunity or they believe that we may need those resources.
 So that will be all part of the Just Transition Plan filing. And again that follows a typical Colorado time line in terms of 9 months or so to work through that proceeding. So it would - pushes that into 2025. But overall, excited those are kind of looking at '28 to [ '29 ], '30 type clean generation opportunities and how do we transition our fleet in Colorado as it will be completely out of coal by the end of 2030 in Colorado.
 On SPS, really great low growth opportunities in SPS. And you noted our sales growth there in 2023, we expect to continue to see significant sales growth in that region. I think that is really the driver of our SPS resource plan. We provided a range from 5,000 megawatts up to 10,000 megawatts. That 10,000 megawatts is really working with our large customers on their electrification forecast. So I think it's a significant opportunity. We do not have that anywhere in our capital plans. So we will make -- we will work through that filing and the New Mexico Commission will -- they don't officially approve it, but they accept the resource plan, and then we'll look to launch the RFP in the summer time.
 And then we'll get our results later in 2024 and likely start working on selection early in 2025. So pretty excited about that plan, excited about supporting the benefits of electrification down in SPS and making sure that we can serve our customers.
 So overall, like I said, really great steel for fuel low growth -- steel for fuel opportunities in serving the low growth in our territories. 
Robert Frenzel: Carly, it's Bob. I just add on to what Brian said is probably remiss if we didn't comment on the Minnesota and the Wisconsin RFPs that are in the SPS RP that's in flight right now, which represents 2,000 megawatts of new clean energy in the Upper Midwest and in the Southwest. We expect resolution of those, as I said in my prepared remarks, this year, and they're included in our incremental capital opportunities in our investor deck. 
Brian Van Abel: And just one more thing to add. We'll be filing a resource plan in Minnesota on February 1, which is a continuation of the transition of our generation fleet as we shut down our coal plants in Minnesota by 2030. And pretty excited about just all the opportunities across our service territories. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. 
Sophie Karp: So I noticed that you showed the Colorado, I guess, earned ROE like sub 8%, if I'm reading this correctly. Just given how much capital you're going to be investing in the state, do you see a path to improve that? And what is that? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Sophie, thanks for the question. Certainly, in Colorado, we've had a pretty significant gap between our authorized versus earned ROE. As we think of all the capital that we're deploying on the clean energy transition that will flow through timely recovery from a rider perspective. Also all the transmission that we need to invest to be able to deliver that clean energy to our customers will flow through the TCA. So the incremental capital should get more timely recovery. I mean it's important as we think about longer term to ensure that we have a financially healthy utility because it allows us to have a competitive cost of capital, which in the long term is that -- most beneficial to our customers as it delivers the lowest cost of customers -- lowest cost to our customers. 
 So something that we're certainly aware of and working on, our stakeholders and policymakers around ensuring that we are aligned with the clean energy policy in Colorado and how we can ensure that we keep that alignment and improve it over time. 
Sophie Karp: So the problem, so to speak there was just a timing lag with capital, which you expect to improve with more contemporaneous mechanisms. Am I getting this right? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And as we mentioned, yes, it is the regulatory lag, the capital lag. We had a historic test year in Colorado gas. And as we mentioned in my opening remarks, we'll be filing a Colorado Natural Gas Case here in the next week or so. And so we'll be working through that. 
Sophie Karp: Okay. All right. And my other question was your volume growth overall for the company was something like 1% or above in '23 and you're basing your guidance on 2% to 3% growth in '24. So I'm wondering where do you expect to see this acceleration and what's the underlying assumption there? 
Brian Van Abel: So as we think about it, yes, our guidance here is 2% to 3% in 2024. The biggest driver continues to be in SPS and the electrification and growth we're hearing from our customers, obviously, we work very closely with our large industrial customers down there, so I have a good sense of what their low growth forecasts are in 2024 and even beyond. We're starting to see some large C&I growth in Colorado with the data center coming online and a couple of other large customers coming online. So really driven by C&I load growth in 2024. We do continue to have customer -- residential customer growth of roughly 1%, so that contribute some. But overall, it's driven by our C&I growth, particularly in SPS. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. 
David Arcaro: I had a quick question just on tax credit transfers. Let's see -- are you changing kind of the anticipated level over the course of the plan given the increased CapEx here? And did that contribute? I saw that the cash flow from ops increased versus the prior slide deck. I'm wondering if that was part of it. 
Brian Van Abel: David, so we incorporate the transferability into the cash from operations. But for us, transferability isn't really cash flow driver when we look plan over plans. We've incorporated all the transfer tax credits in the previous plan, the transfer tax credits in this new plan.
 Certainly, cash flow from ops increased by about $1.5 billion when you look at it from the $34 billion to $39 billion plan. Really, the projects -- there's a net income that drives our book depreciation and some deferred taxes, it's a combination of all 3. Some of these projects do go in service in the middle and so they are good cash flowing assets as we think about it. And so that's why you see that there. 
 From a transferability perspective, now we do include that now in our 5-year forecast. I think prior, I talked about -- we were somewhere around $2.5 billion of transferability. Now we're approaching about $3 billion of transfer tax credits over the 5 years,. Roughly $500 million this year, growing to about $700 million at the end of the 5-year forecast. So we see the demand and have -- actually have much more demand than our supply. 
Operator: Our next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar. 
Travis Miller: I'm disappointed, we don't get to hear your election thoughts. But aside from that, wonder if you could talk a little bit more after you've added this capital and the impact that's going to have, obviously, on financing needs and the impact on the dividend growth, how do you go into these next set of RFPs and any kind of other capital investment opportunities. Does that change your thinking in terms of pursuing some of those projects? 
Robert Frenzel: Tavis, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We really want to own and operate the infrastructure that serves our customers. I think this is a core skill set of the company. We think we're competitive. We think we can do a price competitively for our customers. I think we've proven that over the last 5 or 6 years and delivering value to our customers from our clean energy investments. I think -- it wasn't in our original pro forma estimates, but I think our total over the last 5 years is close to $5 billion worth of tax credits and avoided fuel costs from installing wind into our system for the benefit of our customers, which was never included in our forecast when we put those wind farms in.
 So there's real customer benefit for us owning and passing that stuff through to our customers. As we look to the future, obviously, we want to own and operate the infrastructure. It's important in the regulatory mechanisms, as you said, making sure that we get timely recovery of the new investment assets, is really important for us as we think about installing new generation into our areas.
 But I think our position would be that we continue to want to own and operate generation assets, recognizing that there are going to be likely competitive processes, and we have to prove value to our customers and we've been good at that. And I think our plan would be to continue to target ownership of some amounts of those generation assets. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Travis just to add that -- Bob's absolutely right, we have to demonstrate that we're competitive with our commissions and we have been, and we expect to continue to be so going forward. And so we can continue to deliver low-cost electricity to our customers.
 But I think just from a purely financial standpoint, we've been very open about -- we will fund accretive capital growth, and we'll fund that with a balanced mix of equity and debt and cash flow from operations. So overall, we're very comfortable with it and I think we're in a great to be both to deliver for our customers and our shareholders for the longer term. 
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then one other different subject. Assuming you get the Tolk accelerated depreciation approval in Texas, are there any remaining steps, either regulatory, other procedural steps necessary to hit that 2030 goal of closing your entire coal fleet? 
Brian Van Abel: No. No. That was the last one outstanding. So we're pretty excited about it assuming we get PUCT approval of the settlement. That's the last one. 
Travis Miller: Okay. No transmission operator agreement necessary and anything like that? 
Brian Van Abel: No. 
Operator: Our next question is from [ Ryan Breno ] with Citi. 
Unknown Analyst: A couple of quick questions. In terms of the Marshall fire, I appreciate the clarifications and updates. Is there any opportunity for settlement there outside of the formal court process? 
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, look, it's still very early in the process. But as we've said from the beginning, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the sheriff's report, and we intend to viciously defend ourselves sitting here today. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And given the balance sheet, operator challenges and needs to raise capital over the coming years. Are there any M&A opportunities in terms of asset sales that you'd contemplate to derisk your funding plans? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. First, I guess I'd disagree with the balance sheet challenges. I think we have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry. So I don't necessarily agree with that characterization. But now from an M&A standpoint, now we're comfortable with where we sit in the assets we own. Obviously, we're aware of everything that is going on in the industry. 
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. 
Paul Fremont: Just a quick question on the Marshall fire. Is there any update on the dollar amount of the claims at this point? 
Robert Frenzel: Paul, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. No, no update. I mean the insurance commissioner said that the property damage was in excess of $2 billion. But as far as the total amount of suits, they haven't claimed any liability in the suits or from the plaintiffs. 
Operator: Our last question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. 
Paul Patterson: Just one of my questions have been asked. But on the -- to follow up on Steve Fleishman's question on the PIMs. It seemed like meeting the order and stuff that there was a greater -- that they basically anticipated looking at additional PIMs and sort of we're intrigued with sort of PBR in general. And I was wondering just sort of how you -- I know it's early to say, and it depends obviously what the PIMs are. But given that they seem to be sort of more performance-based PBR directionally driven. How you think you're positioned to deal with that?
 And do you see perhaps not only sticks but also carats, is there a potential, perhaps, that you could do well under PBR, if you follow me? 
Robert Frenzel: Paul, you were breaking up a little bit, but let me see if I understand the question. Given the recent PIMs in Colorado, how do you feel broadly about performance-based ratemaking and things like that.
 Look, I think that it's natural. And as Brian indicated earlier, that we've had capital cost caps on various projects broadly throughout the portfolio. I think the setup PIMs that we worked through with interveners and stakeholders and the commission as part of the CEP in Colorado, I think the process was productive. We have an opportunity to propose. I think they appreciated our proposal. I don't think it's a material move in a certain direction. I think it's probably appropriate and on a project basis probably less so for an entity-wide basis. So I don't see a lot -- I don't read a lot into where we've been with Colorado or with other jurisdictions in terms of incentive mechanisms around capital deployment. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Paul, in the written orders, certainly there's a discussion. We'll work with the staff as we work on the Just Transition plan in terms of looking at well-designed PIMs. And there's also a PIM around potential kind of the emissions achievement. So we look forward to working with staff on that as we move through time. 
Operator: Thank you very much. I'd like to hand it back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any closing remarks. 
Brian Van Abel: Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you very much. That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 23:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, I'll be a coordinator for today's events. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].
 I'd now like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir. 
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results and highlights, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2024 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. 
 As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we'll discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP measures. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. 
 Early this week, a jury in Denver District Court found Xcel Energy liable and its dispute with core cooperative regarding prior year's lost power damages at our Comanche power plant. We intend to appeal the decision. For the third quarter of 2023, we recorded GAAP earnings of $1.19 per share, which includes a onetime nonrecurring tax charge of $34 million related to the ongoing legal dispute. 
 As a result, we have taken a nonrecurring charge of $0.05 per share, which we don't consider part of ongoing earnings. All for the discussion in our earnings call will focus on ongoing earnings. For more information on this matter, please see the disclosure in our earnings release.
 I'll now turn the call over to Bob. 
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with the quarter. We had solid results recording ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for 2023 compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. As a result, we're narrowing our '23 ongoing earnings guidance to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We're also initiating 2024 ongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate. 
 Consistent with past practices, we've reviewed our customer and operational needs and have updated our infrastructure plan for 2024 to 2028. This revised forecast reflects $34 billion of needed capital investment, an increase of $4.5 billion from our previous plan. 
 This base infrastructure investment plan includes substantial resiliency investments in both transmission and distribution including additional upgrades required to support the Colorado Energy Plan. However, it does not include clean energy generation investments that could result from the resource plans in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, or in the Upper Midwest. If approved by our commissions, these cost-effective clean energy generation investments could result in an additional capital need totaling $10 billion from 2024 to 2028 and dramatically reduced carbon emissions in various states. 
 Xcel Energy's resource plans also demonstrate the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, our state's geographic advantages that enable high-capacity renewable generation and our operational expertise and commercial acumen can bring to our customers. In September, we filed our recommended plan in Colorado. This plan seeks to double the amount of renewable energy in the state, making it the largest clean energy transition ever in Colorado history and demonstrates our strong element with the state's environmental goals. 
 Our proposal contemplates the shutdown or conversion of our remaining coal units replaces them with approximately 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy and battery storage and 600 megawatts of dispatchable gas resources to ensure system reliability in times of low wind or solar conditions. These amounts include 4,800 megawatts as proposed to be owned and operated by Xcel Energy for the benefit of our customers. Including the approximately $3 billion in required transmission investments to ensure deliverability and reliability, this Colorado energy plan represents nearly an $11 billion total investment by Xcel Energy. 
 In addition, this portfolio also includes $10 billion in IRA savings to customers. It creates local jobs, promote economic development and provides over $2 billion in tax benefits to local communities in the coming decades. At the same time, it will reduce carbon emissions by over 80% from 2005 levels in Colorado while having expected annual rate impact of only 2.3%. This competitive portfolio provides our Colorado customers an industry-leading opportunity for a cleaner economy at a fraction of the cost most other states would incur. 
 Moving to Minnesota. In September, the commission approved 350 megawatts of new renewable generation, including an additional 250 megawatts at our Sherco facility. This brings the total amount of company-built solar at Sherco to over 700 MW making it one of the largest solar facilities in the country. In October, we also issued an RFP seeking 1,200 megawatts of wind that will utilize our transmission interconnect at our retiring Sherco coal facility and we'll be issuing additional RFPs to fulfill the remainder of the approved Upper Midwest Resource Plan in 2024. 
 Finally, in October, we filed a resource plan in New Mexico. Based on our filing, SPS could require additional 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of new generation by the end of the decade to accommodate increasing demand, plant retirements, and ensure resiliency and reliability of the grid. We've already proposed 418 megawatts of company-owned solar and battery projects that are pending commission approval. We anticipate filing another RFP in 2024 and for the additional generation resources. 
 Shifting to our clean energy innovation projects. The Department of Energy recently announced nearly $1.5 billion in awards to support multiple Xcel Energy affiliated projects. Starting with the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, this estimated $5 billion initiative, which includes multiple projects from Xcel Energy and others received an award of up to $925 million by the DOE. This game-changing funding will serve as a catalyst for clean hydrogen ecosystem in the Upper Midwest and the foundation of our clean fuels efforts at Xcel Energy. 
 Fortunately, the Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming and Utah were not successful in this round of DOE funding. And that said, we remain committed to working with policymakers and federal offices with the hopes that our projects can progress to advance our shared clean energy goals. 
 The DOE also awarded Xcel Energy up to $70 million to support two 10-megawatt 100-hour battery pilots with Form Energy. Combined with the grants from Breakthrough Energy's Catalyst Fund, we secured up to $90 million to support these long-duration energy storage pilots, a critical asset class to ensure cost-effective, reliability in a high renewable grid. 
 With respect to DOE grid resilience and innovation partnerships program, Xcel Energy was selected as part of 2 different awards. First, the DOE we awarded Xcel Energy a $100 million to support projects to mitigate the threat of wildfires and ensure resiliency of the grid through extreme weather. Projects include vegetation management, selective undergrounding, advanced infrastructure technologies, drones, and several additional resiliency projects. Xcel Energy was also partied to grid's $464 million grant to expand transmission as part of the MISO and SPP program to fund high-voltage transmission to improve interregional transfer capability, reliability, and resolve grid constraints. 
 We're appreciative of the DOE support as well as many of our partners in these projects, including our state and regional transmission organizations. Funding support helps us accelerate critical carbon-free technologies, enhance safety and resiliency while keeping costs low for customers. 
 Turning to our natural gas utility. In August, we filed our Clean Heat program in Colorado. This first-of-a-kind plan provides a framework, reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with state goals in our net zero emissions target. The Plant fast track solutions such as electrification, demand side management, clean fuels and certified natural gas. The proposed Clean Heat Plus portfolio reduces greenhouse and gas emissions by 28% by 2030, ensures customer reliability and choice while optimizing customer bill impact. We plan to file a natural gas innovation plan, a corresponding framework for our Minnesota gas utility in the fourth quarter. 
 In September, Meta announced construction of a $700 million data center in Minnesota, which eventually could be one of the largest customers in the state. We continue to evaluate a number of additional data center and commercial opportunities that will further support growth and economic development in our committees. 
 Finally, there are not many new material developments with the Marshall Wildfire litigation. We currently have 14 complaints with 675 plaintiffs which have been consolidated into a single case. For the past four years, Xcel Energy has been operating under a commission-approved wildfire mitigation program in Colorado. We intend to file an updated wildfire mitigation plan next year which will include a wide range of options for stakeholder consideration, including the technologies, undergrounding additional vegetation management, composite poles, selective use of covered conductor and preventative power system shutoffs.
 Let me wrap-up with just a few summary comments before I turn it over to Brian. As we look forward across the next five years and beyond, we see a future that is bright for our communities, our customers and our investors. Xcel Energy is committed to providing a clean energy economy in our regions and it will require meaningful investment to accomplish.
 For our customers, we have the potential to deploy 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts of new clean generation on our systems by 2030, dramatically lowering our emissions profile, affordably powering our customers' homes and businesses, while ensuring 99.99% reliability that they come to expect from Xcel Energy. And through leveraging the benefits of the IRA and the IIJA, we are able to accelerate deployment of renewable resources in pairing them with affordable energy storage assets and other firm dispatchable clean fuel resources to provide reliability. 
 We continue to invest in and innovate our transmission and distribution systems to ensure reliability and resilience and provide for regional and interregional deliverability. We're laying the framework to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions on our natural gas system. All the while our residential customer electric and natural gas builds are amongst the lowest in the country, 28% and 14% below the national average. And given that the regions where we serve customers are the most resource rich in wind and solar, we believe that we can lead this clean energy transition for our customers more cost-effectively than almost any other company. 
 With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. 
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had ongoing earnings of $1.23 per share for the third quarter of 2023, compared to $1.18 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 share which reflects the impact of cost containment actions, lower effective tax rate and conservation and demand side management expenses, which increased earnings $0.03 per share. Note that these items are apparently offset in lower margins are earnings neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. 
 Offsetting these positive drivers, higher interest charges, which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, driven by rising interest rates and increased debt levels to fund capital investment and higher depreciation and amortization expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. 
 Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.1%, largely driven by strong C&I sales. As a result, we now expect annual electric sales growth of 1% to 2% in 2023. 
 Shifting to expenses. O&M decreased $25 million for the third quarter, reflecting management actions to lower costs. We now expect our annual O&M expenses to decline by 1% to 2%. 
 During the third quarter, we also made progress in several regulatory proceedings and we are getting close to wrapping up a busy regulatory year. 2024 will be much lighter from a rate case perspective. In our Colorado electric rate case, the commission approved our settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. Rates were effective in September. 
 In October, the New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement. That reflects a rate increase of $33 million, based on an ROE of 9.5%, an equity ratio of 54.7%, a forward test year an acceleration of total depreciation to 2028. Rates were effective in October. 
 In our pending Texas electric rate case, we reached a settlement in principle on revenue requirements. We're hopeful the parties will reach agreement on class cost allocation and rate design so that we can file the settlement this year. We expect a decision in the implementation rates in the first quarter of 2024. And as a reminder, we have a relate back date to July 13. 
 In New Wisconsin, we continue to work through the regulatory process for our electric and natural gas rate cases and expect the commission decision by year-end. 
 With regards to future rate cases, we plan to file a natural gas rate case for Minnesota in the order and the potential Colorado natural gas rate case in the first quarter of next year. 
 Updating our progress on production tax credit transferability, we recently executed 2 contracts totaling $250 million. We anticipate further PTC sales in the fourth quarter, consistent with our plan totaling $300 million to $400 million for the year. Transferability lowers the cost of our renewable energy projects for our customers and reduces near-term funding needs. 
 Moving to our updated capital forecast. We've issued a robust $34 billion 5-year base capital plan with annual rate base growth of 7.6%. The base plan reflects commission approved renewable projects, including over 700 megawatts of new solar at Sherco. The base plan also reflects significant rate and resiliency investments, including our Colorado Power Pathway, transition to support our Colorado preferred plan, MISO transformer investments, as well as other system investments to maintain asset health and reliability. 
 In addition, we have additional capital investment opportunities for our renewables and firm capacity associated with the Colorado preferred plan, 418 megawatts of proposed self-built solar and Solar SPS and further RFPs in NSP and SPS. We'll update our base capital plan after our various commissions complete their review and finalize their decisions regarding our proposals. 
 These opportunities, if approved, could translate to $10 billion of additional investment through 2028, resulting in annual rate base growth of 10.7%. 
 We've updated our base financing plan, which reflects $15 billion of debt and $2.5 billion of equity. We anticipate that any incremental capital investment would be funded by approximately 40% equity and 60% debt. It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a balanced financing strategy which includes a mix of debt and equity to fund accretive growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Maintaining solid credit ratings and  favorable access to capital markets are critical to fund our clean energy transition, deliver strong shareholder returns and keep customer bills low, especially with rising interest rates. 
 Shifting to our earnings. We've updated our 2023 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2023 ongoing earnings guide range to $3.32 to $3.37 per share. We have a long history of delivering on our financial objectives and expect to continue that trend in 2023. As a result, we anticipate strong earnings in the fourth quarter that will result in achieving our earnings guidance. Key drivers include incremental revenue from the Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases, deferral of certain O&M depreciation and interest expenses as part of the Texas electric rate case, strong O&M cost management, and better-than-expected sales growth. 
 Finally, we are initiating our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. 
 With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our clean energy plans, leveraging the benefits of the IRA to reduce cost for our customers. We proposed a game-changing preferred plan in Colorado, which results in one of the most aggressive renewable bill loads in the country. We secured DOE grants for our Heartland hydrogen hub, wildfire mitigation plants, four-man injury pilots, and transmission expansion, which will accelerate breakthrough technology and reduce risk at a lower cost for our customers. We resolved rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico, while reaching a settlement in principle in Texas. 
 We're nearing our 2023 ongoing earnings guidance and continue to expect to deliver within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years. We announced a robust, updated capital investment program and initiated 2024 guidance that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. And finally, we remain confident we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and continue to keep bills low for our customers. 
 This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Nicely done. Got to say, what a set of updates quarter-over-quarter here. So maybe just to pick things up here real quickly, on the credit side, I mean, I appreciate the commentary about 60-40. Can you comment a little bit about the latest monetization policies for the credit rating agencies and thoughts about monetizing in terms of flowing tax credits through FFO? To what extent does that change or impact your financing plan at all? Just to come back to that a bit. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So we met with the credit rating agencies in September. And as we are sitting right now, we've included tax credit transferability in our financing plan, and we expect that they will include it in the way they look at our credit metrics. And for us, we use the income tax election method, so it will flow through our cash from operations in our financial statements. So all of that is included in our baseline as we think about it. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then separately, just as you think about the upside plan here, I mean, just incredible numbers here. I mean, and I know there's a lot of fixation here in Colorado. Can you walk through a little bit of just the timing here in some of the other jurisdictions in terms of coming to fruition, especially through 2020, it's practically around the corner. Do you want to talk a little bit about the specific timelines to getting some of that full 10 reflected in the plan here just as it goes to aligning against the full update with 4Q or beyond? 
Robert Frenzel: Yeah. Hey, Julien, it's Bob. We're really excited about the Colorado Energy Plan. It's great to see it sort of nearing conclusion and approval milestones. We've been working on this for two years. We've actually been working with the counterparties on the bids for over six months. I recognize that it might be quick timing for the external world, but we've been working with these people for a while and we're really excited about what we've done here. We've been working with stakeholders very collaboratively and the PUC over the past two years to bring this plan to life for our Colorado customers. Obviously a great wrinkle, right in the middle of it with the IRA, right? And so we've basically been able to double the renewable portfolio, have the fossil portfolio, increase our storage component dramatically.
 So we think the plan meets the policy guidelines. The process from here is relatively quick in the grand scheme of things. So we received the independent engineer's report that validated our proposal last week –-- actually Monday of this week I think. We get comments –-- external comments to early November. We applied to those comments late November and then we turn it over to the commission for deliberations. We think that happens in December and early next year and probably early Q1 of next year we'd expect a decision from the commission. So pretty quick given the long time frame of the process in total. 
Brian Van Abel: And Julien, a couple of the other pieces in that steel for Fuel 2.0 plan is the SPS Solar plus Storage, we should get the decision in Q2 of next year. And then we just launched in a sort of 1200 megawatt wind RFP. Bids are due in December, should get a short list in Q2 of next year on that.
 And then not in any in our steel for Fuel 2.0, but really looking forward to working with our stakeholders in SPS. Bob mentioned this in his opening remarks of our New Mexico resource plan. We'll launch an RFP in mid next year and that's 5,000 to 10,000 megawatts of potential generation resources and should get a project selection in call it early to mid-2025 for that. So nowhere in the $10 billion is a great opportunity as we look forward to transitioning to SPS's generation outage. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. It's incredible, again, update. With that, though, and then given the timing early 1Q for at least a good chunk of that. I mean, 4Q could we see an update to your earnings CAGR outlook and/or any other related metrics as you get that clarity affirmed here, at least on the preponderance of it? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Julien, I mean, certainly we'll wait until we get through the commission approvals. But if that timing aligns, then yes, it would be fair to think through that. 
Operator: We'll now move to Nicholas Campanella coming from Barclays. 
Nicholas Campanella: So a couple for me. I guess on Colorado, as you kind of layer in that to the next financing plan, and obviously, you had the 40% rule. Is equity continuing to be programmatic across the 5 years? Or does that drive more -- a larger need in the near years of the plan? 
Brian Van Abel: The way we look at it, the base capital plan pretty programmatic as we think about it, most likely in ATM with the base capital plan. When you look at the -- not just in Colorado, but the $10 billion of the Steel for Fuel 2.0 opportunities, this is really kind of the '25, '26, '27 time frame or the heavy spend. So I would look at it as that's in the time frame that would align with the spend for that incremental and additional opportunities. 
Nicholas Campanella: Got it. And then one more on the Colorado plan. I just -- I know the commission is exploring some type of risk-sharing mechanism for the renewable assets. But can you just help us understand if that type of proposal is something that would tweak the plan in any way? Is it something that you're working with the commission actively on? And how could that kind of transpire through the remaining course of the year here? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Consistent with past practice, Nick, we would expect some forms of customer protection, capital costs or energy cost providers. We've submitted some proposals to the commission that they -- so they are purview. It will go along with their overall decision. And on the portfolio side, of course, there's always a chance to look at it, but we've looked at this sideways, back ways, front ways. I think we've put together a great plan that complements the geographic diversity in the state where the wind and solar physically come into the grid to provide high resilience and reliability from the renewable resources. And so always a chance to move it around a little bit, but we'll think the substantial changes coming from the plan. 
Nicholas Campanella: And if I could just squeeze one more in. You talked about the data centers in your prepared remarks, your weather-normalized load for '24 is 2% to 3%, and that's higher than last year by 100 basis points. So just -- what are you seeing that's changing the demand profile? How are you thinking about the longer-term forecast and whether that's pressure higher in your 5% to 7%? 
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. The way I think about it is -- yes. So we're starting to see a number of things in our long-term sales forecast. We updated our sales forecast for 2024, 2% to 3%. But we think over the 5 years at that 2% to 3% CAGR to hold, if not, call it conservative, given what we're seeing on the potential load from data centers. Data centers represent less than 1% of our sales right now. We see some potential where that could grow to 5% over this next 5 years. 
 As I think about just next year, significant electrification happening in the oil and gas region in the Permian Basin, the Delaware Basin. We're working very closely with our large customers down there around -- it's not just -- it's not really about even more drilling. It's electrification of their pumps compressors as they hit their net zero goals in the Permian Basin and achieve the goals that the state of New Mexico has for them. 
 And then also, we're starting to see an uptick in residential demand. We're starting to see penetration from the EV perspective. So overall, really great trends as we look out -- not only next year but longer term with kind of electrification and data center potential. 
Robert Frenzel: Nick, just to add on to that, this is Bob. When I think about some of the comments I made in the opening remarks, about the ability to deliver clean energy more cost effectively in our regions of the country than other parts. I think over the long term, that should absolutely accrue to our state's benefits in terms of economic development. Energy and energy-intensive resources are going to come back in onshore in the United States. We should be a very attractive destination for them as we can deliver renewable energy and clean energy much more cost effectively. We serve customers where the wind blows and the sun shines and that translates to high capacity factors and lower energy cost to our customers, which should lead to long-term economic development in our states. 
Operator: We'll now move to Durgesh Chopra coming from Evercore ISI. 
Durgesh Chopra: You guys have been sort of the leader in transferability. I mean you were kind of one of the first ones to introduce the concept and start working on it. It seems like you're making great strides here. The target for the year, if I recall this, if I have this correctly, it was increased from $200 million to $300 million to $400 million. I just wanted to see if I'm thinking about that correctly. And then what does that do to the prior point had $1.8 billion in total amount raised from transferability? What does that number look like in the current plan? 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So you're actually thinking about it correctly. When we went into this year before the market has even fully set up, we're a little bit conservative in saying around $200 million. We've already executed 2 contracts for $250 million and working on another. So we feel very good about our $300 million to $400 million in total for the balance of the year. 
 And when we think about our baseline, we've layered in the Sherco solar projects now that they've been approved. So we have a little bit over 5 -- think about it about $500 million run rate annual transfer of PTC credits. So it's about a total of $2.7 billion over our 5-year forecast from '24 to '28. 
Durgesh Chopra: That's really helpful. And then maybe just -- I didn't see this in your prepared remarks on slide deck and maybe I missed it, but just any update on the gas price risk management plan that you have to file in Colorado? I believe that's due next month. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So we'll file it by November 1, absolutely right. So due next week, working with the stakeholders are working on the plan, and we've seen compounded in a couple of different veins. One is this idea of the smoothing mechanism where we can reduce volatility by using our balance sheet. And so if commodity prices spike to a certain level, we would take that on our balance sheet and spread over 1, 2, 3, 4 years and get a carrying cost on it or really reduce that volatility that our customers experienced last year. So that's important because we need to maintain a good balance sheet, strong product quality to be able to use our balance sheet to help our customers out. 
 The second part is really focused on what are the proposals we can make to reduce volatility and that's whether there's additional physical storage, potential for fixed physical contracts or additional financial hedging. So you see all out of par proposal here coming up next week and look forward to working with the commission and the stakeholders and helping reduce the volatility for our customers in Colorado. 
Robert Frenzel: Durgesh just to add on to that, one of the best things we've done for our customers is our renewables portfolio. We have lowered our reliability on fossil fuels dramatically over the past five years and the customers have accrued over $4 billion of fuel savings and tax benefits from that since 2017.
 So as we continue to look forward obviously the Colorado Energy Plan our Upper Midwest Energy plans certainly derisk our customers from a commodity volatility on the electric side. And as we lean into clean fuels, you start to see that on the gas LDC side as well. 
Brian Van Abel: And just to clarify, we meant that we've reduced our reliance on fossil fuels, not the reliability of our fossil fuels. 
Operator: We'll now move to Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. 
Carly Davenport: Maybe just a quick follow-up on your comments just then on tax credit transferability, the color that you've done already kind of $250 million of contracts. Can you just talk a bit about kind of how the market's been evolving relative to your initial expectations and how you kind of think about the competitiveness of that space? 
Brian Van Abel: Carly, thanks for the question. So it's evolved pretty close to how we expected it to this year, bilateral transactions in kind of the pricing we anticipated. There has been significant amount of demand. The demand is much, much greater than our supply of PTCs. Now we're still waiting for a little -- for the treasury staying up their portal and additional administrative requirements. So we feel comfortable executing contracts. 
 I think also what we found and this is the strength of us, as we are a major player in this market. We have a great tax department. And with our balance sheet strength and our credit quality, we have no issue with identifying these credits, which makes it really easy to do business with us.
 And as a certain evolve, we're getting in the longer-term discussions is not just a 2023 or 2024 transaction, but hey, let's look at longer-term multiple years signing up a single counterparty. So we're very pleased with how it's developed, and the amount of interest from their counterparties there. And for us it's great. We have almost 20 Fortune 500 companies in our backyard in Minneapolis in Minnesota. So, it is great to have those relationships at the C-suite level to drive some of these. 
Carly Davenport: Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe to follow up just on the Hydrogen Hub process now that that's been awarded, I guess, how should we be thinking about timeline there? And is there any dependence on that investment cadence going forward on kind of how the tax credit structure looks for hydrogen once we get that from the treasury? 
Robert Frenzel: Sure. So Carly, it's Bob. We're really excited about our clean fuels program, but it is fairly long dated. We are at a place where we are invited to negotiate with the DOE on this upper Midwest Hydrogen Heartland hub. Negotiations, final engineering, those processes are going to take probably 2 years. I wouldn't say we'd start capital deployment until probably the end of our 5-year plan and runs through the end of the decade. I would think that parts of the hub could be activated by 2029 -- 2028, 2029. So it's long-dated investment cycle. 
 It's a $5 billion project. About half of that was attributable to projects that we proposed. So about $2 billion of company capital paired with $0.5 billion of federal money, is sort of how I think about it. None of that is in our financial plan, and that's about the timeline it's going to go on. So we'll still work on -- that does not include any investments also that we would look at some of the projects in Colorado were really attractive as part of our hub application there. We still want to work with the federal offices and our state partners, to see if we can advance some of those projects as well. Again, none of that's in our base case or in our Steel for Fuel portfolio. 
Brian Van Abel: And Carly, the second part of your question, you asked about kind of the guidance around. Obviously, we're still waiting for the guidance from Treasury unless we provided our comments, industry's driver comments. One of the things important to us is on the nuclear qualifying for hydrogen PTC. So hopeful that we get guidance here, rumor sometime in November, but it could push a little bit. 
Operator: We'll now move to Jeremy Tonet coming from JPMorgan. 
Jeremy Tonet: Clearly, an incredible update in Colorado here and just wanted to dive in a little bit more, if I could. Just given the rate base growth as you outlined there, and how should we think about, I guess, the EPS growth relative to the rate base growth, given the higher interest rate environment here, thinking about potentially greater than 10% rate base growth, do you see the gap kind of widening at that point? Or how should we think about that at a high level? 
Brian Van Abel: Jeremy, good question. Obviously, we are in a higher interest rate environment, higher financing market and also have some issue equity -- equity to fund accretive growth which we're very comfortable with. It's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And we've been very consistent about how we'll fund incremental growth. So, as you go through you do see a little bit of a divergence from rate base growth and EPS growth, but certainly, not hard to do the math, and I'm sure all of you have done that math already. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Yes. No, good math to do there. So that makes sense. And just wanted to kind of come in on the O&M side for the guidance there. And I think it's been kind of flat to down, if I recall correctly, but targeting a little bit of an uplift in '24 here. I'm just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color on the increase here and how this O&M, I guess, impacts how '24 guidance could fall out, particularly given Minnesota being a bit lighter than expected? 
Brian Van Abel: Yeah. We take everything that happened in this year from a regulatory perspective rate case perspective taking into account as we give 2024 guidance. When we think about O&M, we're down for this year our guidance for this year is down 1% to 2%. So as we think about next year up 1% to 2% we did some management actions in this year. And so really when I put the 2 years together it's about essentially maintaining flat O&M. It's a big focus from a long-term perspective is investing in technology to improve processes and take cost out of the business. 
 We have innovation and transformation arm focused on eliminating waste and improving processes. We call it One Xcel Energy Way that we've deployed at the start of this year. And also as you go longer term we start to see tailwinds from coal plant shutdowns as we start to shut down a unit of the year almost. So next year is just a little bit of a balance in this year and next year but over flat is how I'd look at it overall. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. On the other side of the coin, as it relates to the sales outlook, you talked about the data center opportunity in supporting the 2% to 3% growth. Is that kind of like the right base to think about beyond '24? Do you anticipate some further acceleration over the 5-year plan? Just trying to calvary, if like the environment is just different now given some of the tailwinds as you talked about. And clearly, as well, oil and gas, a Delaware Basin really click on all cylinders here, a lot of activity that we see on the pipeline side. So just, I guess, curious for those drivers and how that could carry out over time. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I think really next year, as you mentioned, in the Permian Basin, significant growth down in SPS as we're supporting electrification and working closely with our large customers there. 
 From a data center perspective and thinking about the longer-term growth, I do think right now our 5-year sales growth is -- we're projecting 2% to 3% over the 5 years. So kind of think about 2024, and that will continue over the next 5 years. And I think there's even opportunity beyond that as you start to look at what generative AI means from a load perspective and a data center perspective. 
 So pretty excited. We think about -- obviously, there's investment opportunity when we think about loan growth, helping us keeping customer bills low and affordable and that's really important as we look to invest significantly into our system. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Real quick last one, if I could, just kind of rounding things out here. Any updates on the ongoing Marshall wildfire litigation? Any update on whether total liabilities we go to reach the 560 insurance coverage? Or any color you could provide there. 
Robert Frenzel: Yeah. Hey, it's Bob. I don't think we've seen a lot of material updates in Marshall, I think in our disclosures in our Q and in our earnings release are up-to-date. We've seen 675 plaintiffs. To put it in perspective we think there are about 1,100 structures that had some amount of physical damage and estimated by the by the state of Colorado at about $2 billion worth of damage. None of that's changed or been updated. The cases into 14 complaints and has been consolidated into a single case right now.
 The statute of limitation ends at the end of the year. So we think it will be pretty quiet until then maybe a couple of other plaintiffs trickle in through the process and then we'd expect to get a litigation calendar sometime in early next year. 
Operator: We'll now move to Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. 
Anthony Crowdell: Just hopefully, easy one, everything has been answered. Great news on Colorado, but just following up on Jeremy's question. You talked about, I think, the company is going to file a wildfire mitigation plan, I believe, in 2024 in Colorado. Is there a potential for even additional CapEx associated with wildfire mitigation like magnitude, is that similar to what we've seen in the Steel for Fuel 2.0? 
Robert Frenzel: Anthony, Look, we've been operating under WMP in Colorado for the past 4 years. I think that plan was around $400 million in total. We are looking at more capital investments as we roll forward. I think a lot of that's going to be built into the base plan already. I don't think it has anything of the magnitude of Steel for Fuel 2.0. Obviously, the big needle in there would be if we did something very dramatic on undergrounding. I don't see a proposal that will move the needle necessarily in capital expenditures going forward, but something worth looking at. 
Operator: We'll now move to David Arcaro calling from Morgan Stanley. 
David Arcaro: I was wondering, it's clearly a step change in the renewables aspirations and opportunity for Colorado. Could this also apply to Minnesota in terms of potentially seeing an acceleration and a step change in renewables there as you fully realize the benefits of IRA going forward? 
Robert Frenzel: Maybe -- David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. When I think about my prepared remarks, I made the comment around 15,000 to 20,000 gigawatts of -- 15,000 megawatts of generation by the end of the decade. If you think 7 of that's in Colorado, then the balance, 8 to 13 is a combination of SPS and NSP. There's very little in our capital plan, our Steel for Fuel plan that's included for those 2 regions in our capital plan or in our Steel for Fuel 2.0 that Brian laid out. 
 So we have real generation upside investment opportunities. They're a little longer dated. So I think '28 to '30 maybe outside of the plan period. Some might creep into this 5 years, but I think it's really more backdated. 
 But that's a substantial amount of generation in each of those two -- to those jurisdictions. We did go through a resource plan in Minnesota, the 1,200 megawatts that we referenced in terms of RP for next year as part of that program. But there's probably 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts of that is in the Upper Midwest, largely approved as part of our last resource plan that we need to go execute upon. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And we have -- as we mentioned we have the 1,200 megawatts of wind RFP in flight. We actually have Wisconsin RFP, solar RFP in flight that we're working on. we think we'll file another resource plan, but also significant opportunities in Minnesota longer date is around our wind repowerings.
 And the assets that we put in service in the 2018 to 2021 timeframe, we're requiring a couple of older ones that we brought forward to the commission and it's a great way to increase output and save our customers' money. And so we'll look at those as we get closer to the time period as another opportunity in terms of being able to buy savings for our customers and invest in steel in the ground. 
David Arcaro: Got it. That all makes sense. That's helpful to frame it up. And I was curious what's the latest that you're seeing in Renewables economics in terms of LCOE? In your service territories there's been market concerns about rising PPA prices inflationary pressures in the renewable supply chain. But just curious what your experience has been in terms of latest data points how attractive have renewables projects looked? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes, David, look, so the great benefit of the last couple of years is obviously the Inflation Reduction Act. We've definitively seen higher capital costs in wind and in solar, the IRA and the tax benefits of 100% PTCs have been able to offset that, at least in our jurisdictions on an LCOE business. So probably I'll give you some data points. I'd say we've seen probably 30 -- from our last approved wind project, which would have been our Dakota Ridge project, we built that for around 1,200, 1,250 kW, we've probably seen capital cost increases on wind or 30% to 40% on top of that. 
 But the IRA has offset all of the capital cost improvements as well as NCS improvements as well as NCS improvements from better technology and the bigger turbines. Those 2 combinations have put our LCOEs on those projects in line with what we put wind into service for in 2018 and 2019. So we're really favorable participants. Our customers are great beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act keep the levelized cost of energy very, very affordable for our customers. 
 And when I think about -- I made the comment earlier around sort of economic development opportunities. We're putting wind in -- let's say we're putting wind in around $20, $22 a megawatt-hour. You compare that to offshore wind on the East Coast at north of $100 and we think over time lower cost energy will accrue an economic benefits to our regions of the country. 
Operator: We'll now move to Travis Miller of Morningstar. 
Travis Miller: Just a couple of quick follow-ups to some of the earlier questions in your comments. That 1% to 2% moving the sales number to 2% to 3%, what's the approximate earnings impact there incremental, all else equal? 
Brian Van Abel: Just easiest rule of thumb is I'll call it a 1% change in sales, there's about a $25 million change in the revenue from our sales. So, that's a good rule of thumb for you, Travis. 
Travis Miller: Okay. After-tax, that's earnings, right? 
Brian Van Abel: No. That was revenue -- sorry, that's revenue. And that takes into account our true-up in decoupling mechanisms. 
Travis Miller: Okay. So, pre-tax. Okay. Got it. And then on the Heartland and some of the other projects you've mentioned in terms of new technology other hydrogen projects, is your thought for us is to put that through some of those things through the regulatory traditional regulatory process? Or do you foresee potentially coming up with another financing structure another corporate structure, is something that would house some of those projects that are say unusual in a positive way obviously? 
Robert Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Good morning. Our proposed plan would certainly put the assets into regulatory rate base here in the Upper Midwest. If you think about our proposals at the DOE, we've got green hydrogen off of wind and solar. We've got pink hydrogen off of nuclear plants and the end users are going to help partners create green fertilizers, green ammonia to green urea to fertilizer, as well as some amount of blending into our gas plants and into our LDCs with some of the output. So the expectation is they would go through a regular state process around that capital investment and those ultimate uses for the fuel. 
Travis Miller: Okay. Perfect. And then real quick, Minnesota, any update on the timing of your appeal process? 
Robert Frenzel: Yes, so sorry, thanks. We went through a reconsideration process in mid-September. I think our appeal plan would be early November. 
Travis Miller: Okay. And then about how long does that take -- would you think? 
Brian Van Abel: Sometime into next year. 
Operator: We'll now go to Ross Fowler calling from UBS. 
Ross Fowler: So Brian maybe one for you, since you guys are sort of on the leading edge of lets transferability and feel free to take us offline, if we can't do it in seven minutes. But I'm just thinking through like how do you think about the accounting? Do you record the nonmonetary assets at fair value and then book a sort of gain and loss against that when you get to cash? Or there's no FASB guideline here right if I've got it right. So how are you walking through the accounting of these source ones that you're doing? And can we get clarification from FASB or the IRS at some point about how the accounting should work? 
Brian Van Abel: Certainly, we work closely with our audit firm on this and the audit firm is working with the -- the Big Four are working together. The way we look at -- it's an income tax model election for us. And so what that means is we're going to run it through the gains and losses through income tax expense on the income statement. And so any discounts on the sales will run through that and then from a regulatory approval of regulatory mechanisms for that discount whether we'll be able to have deferral treatment of the discount with our regulatory approval. So really because this is a benefit of our customers to be able to have that regulatory deferral mechanism is helpful. And then it will run through our cash from operations. So I think income tax expense line item and then cash from operations. 
Operator: We'll now take questions from Paul Patterson calling from Glenrock Associates. 
Paul Patterson: So all my questions have been answered, except for -- and congratulations. But just on Comanche. I saw that -- can you hear me? The Comanche litigation, just was wondering with the jury [ award ] and everything, where we stand with that? Is that pretty much over? And just if you could elaborate a little bit more on that. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I mean it's -- we will appeal. We feel that we have a strong legal challenge against -- there's 2 items and the award is related to lost power. I mean the majority upon no liability in all the other allegations, including no word for diminution of plant value. So as Paul mentioned in the opening comments, we view it as a onetime charge, and we have a strong legal basis for challenging that $26 million of award. 
Paul Patterson: Okay. So that was what -- that charge -- that jury award was what was reflected in the third quarter results. Is that right? 
Robert Frenzel: That's correct. 
Operator: We'll now go to Ryan Levine calling from Citi. 
Ryan Levine: What's your current thought on PPAs buy-ins in light of some of the tax tenability dynamics and some of the developments that you're having? 
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, it's something we have nothing in our capital plans for PPA buy-ins or PPA buyouts as we think about it. It's something that can come through the RFP processes. As we think about it, and we work closely with our developers to see if there's an opportunity. 
 The way I think about the opportunities may come in, if you can buy out a wind farm and repower it, that's where we've been successful with our PPA buyouts. But we think it has an incremental very opportunistic -- call it opportunistic, hard-to-predict opportunities, and that's why we don't put anything in our capital plans. But we do work closely with our developers to see if there's opportunities from time to time. 
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then regarding the -- looks like $100 million DOE grant or wildfire mitigation, that's been rewarded more recently. As you go into a lot of wildfire mitigation plan and look at more spending, is there opportunities to receive digital brands? Are you pursuing any capital to automate your plan? 
Robert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. I don't know if there's more dollars in the DOE bucket in the grid resiliency program. Obviously, we're going to take these dollars and continue to do additional work. Those were discrete projects that were approved with the DOE and are earmarked across our various states. Some of which is for wildfire. Some of it is in technology development. So we're excited about partnering with the DOE. It's about 60-40 split in terms of their funding versus our capital, and our piece is embedded within our forecast. So it's not going to be a big upside in terms of capital investment opportunities. 
 But as we look to the long term, on wildfire mitigation plan. We're going to work with all of our stakeholders in our various states. But the wildfire mitigation plan in Colorado should get filed late this year or early next and look to be very proactive in how we handle system hardening, new technology to bring to bear to minimize the risk of ignition for our customers in the state, obviously, protecting their assets and their help is our priority. 
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I was in just taking a step back. We're proud of the 4 grants that we've received really focusing on how can we help lower the cost of our customers, others for new technology around and specifically on the  form long-duration battery. And not only do we get $70 million in deal refunding for that, but we also got $20 million from Breakthrough Energy Ventures. So $90 million for those 2 pilots. So really a great story and looking forward to working with our commissions on all the DOE funding that we've received so far. And certainly, we'll look for other opportunities out there. 
Operator: As we have no further audio questions. I turn it for closing remarks. I turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel. 
Brian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. 
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We wish you a very good day, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be listen-only. [Operator Instructions]. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. I will now hand you over to your host, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations to begin today's conference. Thank you.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome Xcel Energy's 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2023 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with our results. We faced some headwinds from weather and other items in the second quarter, recording earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. We've got tangible plans in place for the second half of the year to overcome the inflationary pressures as well as the impact of the lower-than-expected ROE in the Minnesota electric rate case and allow us to deliver on our 2023 guidance. But our strategic priorities are unchanged. Leading the clean energy transition, enhancing our customers' experience and keeping our customers' bills low. And we've delivered on this strategic vision across our eight states for the past decade. We invest in clean energy resources that provide both financial cost savings to our customers while transitioning to a lower carbon economy. We invest in network infrastructure to foster economic development for new businesses to provide top quartile reliability and to provide resiliency in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather. We're also building infrastructure to accelerate clean transportation for all of our customers and exploring innovative technologies like batteries and clean fuels to enable the policy objectives and the customer desires for a lower carbon economy, and we focused on continuous improvement to operate efficiently with a lower expense burden to our customers. And as a result, we've been able to keep our operating expenses nearly flat for over the past -- for over a decade. Our customers benefit from these actions, including significant carbon reductions and residential bills that are 20% below the national average. As you can see, we have a long history of delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders and are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance again in 2023. This quarter, we made progress on our clean energy transition plans with a growing portfolio of both company-owned resources and power purchase agreements. In our NSP solicitation, we recommended an incremental 250 megawatts of self-build solar generation in a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement. This brings our total company-owned solar projects at Sherco to over 700 megawatts which will utilize the transmission rights for the first of the three retiring coal units there. In the SPS RFP, we recommended a portfolio of 418 megawatts and self-build solar projects and a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. We're also proposing a battery storage project to one of the new self-build solar facilities. In addition, later in the quarter, we expect to file our recommended Colorado portfolio for nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential resources. And based on our interim analysis, the outcomes should be very beneficial to our customers. Across our eight-state footprint, we enjoy a geographic advantage for wind and solar resources, which enables higher capacity factors. And as a result, Xcel Energy can deliver new renewables at low and competitive prices due to a combination of high capacity factors, IRA tax benefits and the ability to reuse transmission from retiring plants, all of which provides significant benefits to our customers. enables a faster transition to a clean energy economy. Each of these RFPs would represent incremental opportunities as compared to our base capital forecast. We anticipate commission decisions on these proceedings in the second half of 2023 for Minnesota and Colorado, and in the first half of 2024 for SPS. In May, Breakthrough Energy Ventures announced a $20 million grant to support our two 10-megawatt pilot projects for Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology. In July, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved the Form Energy pilot to be installed at our Sherco site alongside our new solar projects. We plan on filing for our second Form Energy pilot later in the quarter and are evaluating sites that could be supportive of this exciting new clean energy technology. We're also working with the Department of Energy and additional funding opportunities to further reduce the cost of these projects for our customers. In May, we filed our second transportation electrification plan in Colorado, the proposed plan, which covers the 2024 to 2026 period includes expanded solutions and rebates to support new public charging stations and charging at homes, businesses, multifamily buildings and community locations. It also proposes programs supporting electric school buses, innovation and income qualified customers. Our focus is to bring clean transportation to all customers and communities and to expeditiously assist in the build-out of quarter charging to reduce range anxiety of EZ purchasers. Next month, we plan to file our Clean Heat plant in Colorado and will follow with our natural gas innovation plan for Minnesota during the fourth quarter. These plans will be similar to our electric resource plans and provide a framework for our natural gas system to achieve our carbon reduction goals while meeting the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Taken as a whole, these innovative projects and partnerships in electricity and clean transportation and home heating are essential for Xcel Energy to meet our sustainability goals and to continue to deliver our customers the safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy that they expect now and long into the future. In June, the Boulder County Sheriff office announced the findings of its investigation into the cause of the Marshall Fire in December of 2021. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and the communities impacted by this devastating fire, including our own employees whose homes and families were directly affected. The report states that the first Marshall Fire started as a result of an ignition on a property affiliated with an entity called the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition had nothing to do with Xcel Energy's power lines. The Sheriff's report also discusses a second ignition that started more than an hour after the first fire at a different location, which the report estimates is approximately 80 to 110 feet away from our power lines. Sheriff's report says that the most probable cause of the second ignition was PSCo's power lines, and we strongly disagree with that conclusion. Because of the pending litigation has been filed, we're not in a position to discuss the Marshall fire in more detail at this time, but we will vigorously defend ourselves and look forward to presenting our position in court. Importantly, additional information about the lawsuits and some of the relevant legal standards is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing, and I would direct you there. Finally, we recently released our comprehensive sustainability report. The report focuses on four core ESG pillars: Reach Net Zero responsibly; strengthen our communities; operate with integrity and to value people. It details our progress in achieving our industry-leading ESG goals as well as our priorities moving forward. Some of the key highlights include Xcel Energy has reduced our carbon emissions by 53% since 2005. And more than half of the electricity we provide to our customers comes from carbon-free resources as compared to 41% nationwide. We outperformed the industry reliability standard restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events. In this past year, in addition to contributing over $10 million to local organizations through the Xcel Energy Foundation, our employees contributed $3 million and volunteered over 74,000 hours for nonprofit and community improvement projects. We're proud of our track record. It's keeping with our corporate strategy, and it's based on our values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. Please note that the line-by-line income statement comparisons are more complicated this quarter as a result of true-ups for the Minnesota rate case this year and the Texas rate case last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower depreciation and amortization expense increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to the reversal of deferrals in the Texas rate case last year and the extension of depreciation lives from the Minnesota rate case. These decreases are partially offset by our capital investment program. Lower taxes other than income taxes increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting property tax deferrals in Minnesota and Colorado. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers, lower electric revenues less fuel decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, reflecting unfavorable weather, the impact of the Minnesota rate case and recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case last year. Higher O&M expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6%. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, which is driven by growth in C&I sales, partially offset by projected declines in residential sales. Now shifting to the expenses. O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the timing of generation outages, higher bad debt expense, insurance costs and inflation, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs from the Texas electric rate case in 2022. Given these drivers as well as the Minnesota rate case decision, we are taking actions to mitigate O&M, which will include evaluating discretionary programs, staffing levels, consulting, employee expenses, variable compensation and other management actions. As a result, we now expect O&M expenses to decline 3% for the year. During the second quarter, we also made progress on several regulatory proceedings. Starting with our completed proceedings. In June, Minnesota Commission approved a three-year electric rate increase of $311 million based on an ROE of 9.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. We plan to file for reconsideration of the decision as we felt the ROE was not consistent with the ALJ recommendation or recent commission decisions in other Minnesota proceedings. In our South Dakota electric rate case, the commission approved a settlement for approximately $14 million revenue increase. In our pending Colorado Electric rate case, we reached a partial settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7%, and a 2022 historic test year. Remaining items for litigation are the structure of the TCA rider and treatment of depreciation. We expect the commission decision later this summer with rates going into effect in September. In our New Mexico electric rate case, we reached a contested settlement that reflects a rate increase of $33 million based on an ROE of 9.5%, equity ratio of 54.7% in the forecast test year. We expect the decision and implementation of final rates by October. Both the Colorado and New Mexico settlements reflect significant negotiation and compromise by Xcel Energy and a wide range of interveners with varied interests. The parties believe that the settlements resulted in a just and reasonable outcome for our customers. As a result, we are hopeful our commissions will approve the settlements without modifications. We also have pending rate cases in Wisconsin and Texas which are early in the process. Intervener testimony is expected in the Texas case in August, with a decision in the first quarter of next year, while in Wisconsin we expect intervener testimony in the Fall and a commission decision by year-end. Turning to the Inflation Reduction Act. As most of you are aware, the U.S. Treasury recently provided guidance on tax credit transferability, which was consistent with our expectations. We have considerable demand and anticipate monetizing excess tax credits later in the year. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. Please note that the guidance assumption changes regarding capital riders, depreciation, property taxes and ETR primarily reflect regulatory decisions or changes to assumed PTC levels and are largely earnings neutral. However, the lower O&M and a portion of the interest expense assumptions will generally impact earnings. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 earnings within our guidance range as we have for the past 18 years, managing through regulatory outcomes, changing economic environments, and periodic headwinds. We're delivering on our capital plan and executing on opportunities including clean generation, transmission and distribution to support reliability, resiliency, and broader economic growth. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we support our communities and states in the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks further. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Robert Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?
Jeremy Tonet: Good, good. Thanks for having me. Just wanted to touch base with a bit on the targeted O&M reductions as you called out there for these efficiencies in 2023. I was wondering if you could peel back the onion a little bit more to see how much of this is one-time in nature versus carry forward into future years? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.
Brian Van Abel: Sure. Hey, good morning, Jeremy and thanks for the question. So I think I'll hit on it a couple of different ways. Talk about kind of the near-term actions and we think about it. How do we hit our year-end O&M guidance? One is we look at second half of last year we had elevated O&M, if you look at versus the first half of last year, and particularly in Q4 as there was some one-time items in Q4 relative to having a good year, investing in the system. And then there are some impacts this year where we've had some timing of generation outages earlier in this year. And we also expect bad debt expense to decline. We saw some higher bad debt expense levels given the commodity price impacts earlier in this year. So as I think about that, bad debt expense level should be more sustainable. You have some timing and generation outages, but then we're also looking at a number of what I call it near-term and long-term opportunities. Near-term is what you'd call more one-time discretionary items around program spend, consulting, third-party contracts and variable compensation levers, more traditional management initiatives. But I think we're spending a lot of time on longer-term initiatives around our Innovation and Transformation team. We've invested heavily in driving what we call waste elimination and process improvements across our orgs. And then we're also investing heavily in technology. You heard me, I've talked about before something we call the Digital Operations Factory, which is focused on using AI in our operations. We started that in nuclear with our Corrective Action program. Now we're rolling that out to distribution and gas in our field operations and that's using traditional AI. We're also looking at now use cases for Gen AI. So as we look at it, our goal is to hit 3% down for the year. Longer term, our goal is to kind of keep O&M flat. And as Bob said, we've done that for nearly a decade and so we have some work to do to get there a balance of a year, but then think longer term O&M flat as we go forward.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very comprehensive, very helpful there. And so that kind of touches on, I guess, the next question I had is just with regards to, will the Minnesota order, if and it caused you revisit any embedded assumptions over the remainder of your five year plan at this point, and has these kind of O&M items, as you called out, adjusted for that?
Brian Van Abel: No, I don't think it does. I think about our long-term assumptions and our long-term 5% to 10% earnings growth rate. We continue to expected to leverage on upper half of that long-term guidance.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just at a higher level, if I could, given the growth of wildfire risk, has your mitigation strategy, I guess, evolved over time or do you have any other thoughts on that side?
Robert Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. I appreciate the question. As you know, we've been operating under -- in Colorado under a Wildfire Mitigation Plan that was instituted probably more than three years ago. And that plan is due to be refreshed in Colorado at the end of this year. And we expect to propose continuation of existing programs and new programs in Colorado that understand the volatility of weather in the west and the footprint of the Colorado company in particular. So we're still working through that. Nothing specific right now, but certainly looking at everything that we can in terms of the risk and the opportunities to strengthen our own system and make sure that we protect our communities and our customers.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Just one last one, if I could, post what we've seen in Minnesota here so far. Does your view of the relative attractiveness of Minnesota versus Xcel's wider footprint change in anyway.
Robert Frenzel: Look I think, as I said in my opening remarks, we feel like we've run a really good utility in Minnesota and across our eight states, focusing on our customers and our communities and helping our states achieve their policy objectives around clean energy and clean transportation. And the outcome, I'll say, was disappointing for two reasons. Paul and Brian mentioned one, which was -- it was inconsistent with previous decisions in Minnesota that have been 94 to 965. But equally important, probably didn't recognize what I think Xcel Energy is a national leading utility in advancing a lot of these initiatives. Making sure we do it reliably and affordably and sustainably. We'll continue to review our investment opportunities and our programs in the state, but I think generally really confident that this is our headquarters state. We want to work proactively with the Governor and the legislature and the PUC to advance these initiatives.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Sorry, I was on mute.
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Durgesh.
Robert Frenzel: Three years later, we're still getting caught by the mute button.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, can you hear me now? I'm sorry.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, great.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Sorry about that, guys. Brian, I heard you mention the Minnesota rate case item. Just appeal or rehearing. Could you just give us a little bit more color there as to what the next steps are timeline?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, the reconsideration, its -- we need to file for reconsideration 20 days after the written order, so that's coming up. And so certainly we will file for reconsideration right around ROE, around the decision on the prepaid pension asset and some other expense levels. And we're hopeful the Minnesota Commission will take that up and look at hard at our reconsideration filing, and they have 60 days once -- they have 60 days to decide. So that's the process.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay, so that should be coming out shortly, and then 60 days after is a decision whether they take it up or not. That's just the Minnesota Commission?
Brian Van Abel: Yes.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you. And then know you mentioned the transferability guidance was in line with your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion within the industry, investors and credit agencies on the implications to CFO -- I know you're very knowledgeable on this topic in general. So just get your thoughts there, how you're seeing this play out and implications for your credit metrics?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, so I mean, we've spent a lot of -- I would call it an industry collaboration on how we work this through our financials. And so not only worked with a lot of our peer utilities who've also worked with the big four accounting firms. And so every renews going to be in accordance with GAAP, it's going to -- we'll take the income tax approach. It's going to flow through our income tax expense line. That will also flow through cash from operations. And so I think it's pretty straightforward. And I know there's been a lot of discussion whether it will show up in the FFO to debt metrics. So I feel pretty good about it because it absolutely will reflect economics of our underlying financials. And it is -- for us, right, it will be a reoccurring cash flow benefit as we look to monetize these tax credits. So I feel pretty good about how it will be reflected across the rating agencies and we've spent time with each of those talking them through that. And like I said, also worked closely with the big 4 accounting firms and generally approach the whole industry will take.
Durgesh Chopra: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just to the extent you're willing to comment on this, just a little bit more pointed question on 2023 guidance. Obviously, you mentioned the history of meeting and exceeding expectations. Just with the unfavorable weather and the regulatory decision, where are you tracking and with your sort of cost efforts in place, what are you targeting? Or where are you tracking within that guidance range?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So sitting here today, six months of the year, right, we're tracking to midpoint of the guidance. And I'll give you a little bit more color, right? I think about it in kind of three buckets. First is execution of our -- on our O&M plans, which I talked about earlier. Second is we build additional rate case revenue that will come in the door in the second half of the year, particularly with the Colorado rate case in flight, the New Mexico rate case in flight and then there's still continued to benefit from Wisconsin last year. And then we do have expected continued sales growth in our service territories. And so those are really the three buckets that I think about it in targeting midpoint of guidance. And obviously, as we normally do in Q3, we will look at where we are in Q3, investing to tighten guidance.
Durgesh Chopra: Very clear. Thanks so much, Brian. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin- Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thank you so much for the time and appreciate it. I wanted to focus on the wildfire dynamics. Obviously, a lot of sensation on this, perhaps principally coming from out of state as well. Can you elaborate a little bit? I know in the prepared remarks, you said you referred us to the 10-Q immediately here, but can you elaborate at least on your insurance levels today, your insurance programs across the states as well as how do you frame the risk here from the lawsuits that have been filed? I imagine that some of the commentary you alluded to in the Q here, but can you help frame up your understanding as well as maybe some of the differences critically from some of the out-of-state considerations that are drawn with new scrutiny?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, hey Julien, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. And here's what I can say about Marshall right now. The Boulder County share report concluded that the Marshall Fire first ignited on the property of the Twelve Tribes and that this ignition was unrelated to our equipment. With respect to the cause of a second ignition which began an hour after the first, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the Sheriff's report, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court. The Sheriff's report concluded that there were no design or installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies in public services, electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. And so regarding the litigation, there's a hearing in September where we expect to learn more about the procedural next steps, additional information on the lawsuit and the legal standards are included in our disclosures in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Given the lawsuits, I don't think we're going to comment any further beyond those particular disclosures. I'll let Brian comment on insurance coverage, but other than that, I think we're going to stick to our disclosure statements.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, the insurance coverage is included in our disclosure is approximately $500 million.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Understood. And then any further commentary about the differences in context across different states, especially whether it pertains to legal recovery constructs and/or jury constructs?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, it's all included in disclosures an entire page of disclosures in the earnings release in the Q.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Fair enough. We will leave it there. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Anthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning, Bob. Good morning, Brian. And good morning, Paul. Sorry, I didn't want to leave you out. Just hopefully two quick questions, one on Julien -- following up on Julien with the Marshall fire. Is there a timing when that resolves itself? Or you just have to let it play to the courts and you can't give any real feel of when that proceeding will wrap up and that overhang lifted?
Robert Frenzel: As I mentioned, look, we have a September hearing where we're going to learn a lot more about the procedural schedule, and we'll know more of that.
Paul Johnson: Yes. And Anthony, we really can't go beyond what we've already said in the disclosure. So we have to limit the questions on that.
Anthony Crowdell: Okay. Great. And then on Slide 11, the pending settlement in Colorado. Just -- you talked about, I think an alternative rate increase $47 million, but that's dependent upon, I guess some coal plant deferrals. I'm just curious if you could talk about how the commission will they hopefully, when they approve the settlement, is that when they will address how they handle the coal plant deferrals? Or does that get rolled into a separate proceeding?
Robert Frenzel: No. Anthony, that will all be decided within the rate case decision that the commission will make here in Q3. So they deliver -- they had hearings on it in July, and so it's all part of the record. So it's kind of either the $95 million one or the alternative if you defer some additional depreciation is $47 million. And that $48 million difference is just the deferral of depreciation. So all will be decided.
Brian Van Abel: So it would be earnings neutral, but it would have a cash flow impact, obviously.
Anthony Crowdell: Great, thanks. I'm good from here. Thanks again for taking the questions.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can just ask a couple of questions here. So on volumes, I'm just curious if you could discuss a little bit what drive the volume variability here like aside from weather -- it seems like C&I volumes were equally or closed equally weak as well as residential. So what are some puts and takes that drive it, I guess, year-over-year?
Brian Van Abel: Sophie, yes, if I think about sales and really looking at the weather normalized sales, we continue to see really strong growth on the C&I side out of SPS and in Q2 on a weather normalized basis. We had strength in Minnesota and Wisconsin to Colorado on a year-to-date basis on C&I. There is a large manufacturing facility was down for the first quarter in the first quarter of this year in Colorado. So that had some weakness on the residential side, the residential while we're down close to 1% for the year. It's tracking in line with our forecast or expectations for the year, right? We continue to see good customer growth, but we do see continued use for customer declines as our -- we have really strong energy efficiency and DSM program. So I think overall, it is tracking both on the C&I side and on the resi side, is tracking to expectations for kind of through the first six months and for the balance of the year with our guidance on sales.
Sophie Karp: All right. And maybe I can just ask the bigger picture question here. I know you've been looking at potentially involvement in operating into 1 of your territories? Just kind of curious how you're still thinking about that and if it's been a new progress to report.
Robert Frenzel: It's Bob. We look, we -- as a company, we certainly have a view on nuclear, both current and future. Key priority for us is preserving the existing nuclear fleet and making sure that -- there's a potential for a nuclear future for the country. We have been working with a company called NuScale on their technology. It's an SMR technology mostly helping them through the nuclear regulatory process and making sure that their applications meet the NRC guidelines and hoping to get that, that technology can get through the regulatory process. We don't have plans as a company to own or operate a SMR at this point. We really are just taking our nuclear expertise and helping with the nuclear future for that company with -- so we don't have any specific plans to announce on SMRs in specifics.
Sophie Karp: Okay, thank you. That's all from me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Carly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Robert Frenzel: Hi, Carly. Welcome aboard.
Carly Davenport: Thank you, appreciate that. Bob, you've been vocal about sort of an all of the above approach kind of on the energy transition from a technology perspective. And you talked a little bit about the grant to support the Form Energy pilot. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of how that pilot is evolving and other opportunities that might exist in that space for itself, if you think about long duration storage?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, happy to. Look, as we think about it as a company, first utility to announce 100% carbon free. Given our geographic position, our ability to transition with wind and solar cost effectively for our customers through the end of this decade allowed us to make an interim target of an 80% carbon reduction, we feel very confident in that. But we've always been focused on we need new technology, new research, development and deployment of new technologies to achieve our 100% goal in the nation's clean energy goal One of the big pieces of that is obviously energy storage. We have a lot of lithium ion for our batteries around the country, and we have some on our own systems. The long-duration energy storage is a critical part of the energy future. And so the Form Energy battery is a 100-megawatt hour battery. So instead of 4 hours, it's 4 days. And that's a nice asset class as we think about periods when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. And we've seen evidence of that as recently as early June of this year. In the Southwest, where we had very limited wind production. We've seen it in polar vortexes, where in Winter Storm Uri, where we had no wind production for almost a 3-day period. So this idea of a long-duration battery is really interesting. What's exciting about Form, in particular, it's a pretty old technology really. This was found by the Department of Energy almost 60 years ago. But it's becoming commercializable by a new company, Form Energy and they're a breakthrough energy VC-funded company, an Energy Impact Partners-funded company. And the technology is pretty interesting. I want to call it simple because that would minimize the impact and the efforts of the development team and the founders of that company but it's basically resting and de rusting iron. And the great part about that is iron is readily available. It's domestically available, not subject to counter parties and regimes in the world where we have challenges. And so when I think about new technologies, sometimes it's not the best that wins, it's the one that's most commercializable and the 1 that can deploy the fastest. And I was really proud to be in West Virginia last month and breaking ground with the Form Energy team with Secretary Grand Home and Sender Mansion. We're building an 800-megawatt capable factory in West Virginia as we speak, with low guarantees and grants from the government. So this is a technology that's going to come to fruition. It's a technology that's going to be scalable. We're really pleased to be their first partner in sales of that, but it's a pilot. It's 10 megawatts and we're going to put it on a 9,000 megawatt system. So we have a great opportunity to build it with them and invest alongside and then the breakthrough energy grants and the potential DOE grants buy down that cost and buy down that risk for the company. So very exciting technology, really excited about the future, what this can mean.
Paul Johnson: And Carly, I would just add, we have another pilot in Colorado [indiscernible], which is a liquid metal technology that we'll have online in 2024. That's a to duration, so kind of call it mid duration. So we're spending a lot of time on this new technology. And I think also longer term, if we kind of broaden the definition of energy storage, green hydrogen is a form of energy storage as we think about longer term, be able to store and then burn it through some of our firm to stash all units longer term. So we're pretty excited about a lot of you call it new technologies and glad really happy to see how excited our Minnesota commission is on form energy with the unanimous approval of that project.
Carly Davenport: Awesome. I appreciate those perspectives. And then the follow-up just around earnings guidance, and obviously, you're reiterating the guidance for 2020. I just wanted to check in on temperature on the 5% to 7% long-term guidance. As you kind of think about the incremental spending opportunities from a CapEx perspective along with some of the regulatory outcomes that you've seen kind of how are you thinking about that long-term range?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Carly, good question. And we fully expect to continue delivering in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. So that's unchanged. I think you mentioned the incremental opportunities that we have. And I think in Bob's comments, he mentioned the Sherco Solar free Farm, the SPS, the 418 megawatts of solar farms that are going to provide significant customer benefits in SPS. We filed that CCN yesterday. So those 2 together are north of $1 billion of clean energy investments that will benefit our customers that are outside of our current capital plan. And I think longer term, right, we'll file here in Q3 or preferred plan or with the Colorado Commission around our RFP going into that, those decided pre IRA with the commission ruled on that resource spend before we could layer on the significant benefits significant customer benefits of the IRA. So when we look at how the costs are coming in relative to what was approved, we believe we will go bigger and faster and above what the initial 4,000 megawatts of renewables in stored showed. So we're excited to work with our Colorado Commission on that, look for that filing in Q3 and hopefully give a decision then even more longer term in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll be filing more RFPs in Minnesota, Colorado and SPS for further significant additions of clean energy assets as we march towards a 0 by 2030 goal. So I'm pretty excited about it, pretty excited about long-term opportunities, and we do feel good about delivering in the upper half of our long-term guidance range.
Carly Davenport: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steven Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Good to have all of you. On the phone including Paul. Just first, one Marshall fire question. Is there a deadline when any claims need to be filed by?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Steve, it's Bob. My understanding is that claims are a 2-year deadline. So that would say the end of this year is when claims need to be filed.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. Second question, a different topic on the Colorado settlement. Is there -- I know I think you mentioned Q3 for the final order. Is there a specific date for that approval?
Paul Johnson: There's not a date, Steve, but we expect that the commissioner rule probably in the middle of August, whole deliberations in the middle of August.
Steven Fleishman: Okay. And then lastly, just I know you all have been pretty focused on a number of IRA provisions, including the hydrogen one. And I'm just kind of curious latest thoughts on the ability to look at hydrogen production green hydrogen, all those kind of pillars of the green hydrogen, when do you think you'll get -- we'll get that out and whether nuclear might be included in that or this additionality going to be a problem for that?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, Steve, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We've been very active in clean fuels in general and hydrogen in particular. Look, philosophically, we believe that we're going to undergo a large period of electrification over the next 10 or 20 years as a country and as a company, but that there are parts of the economy that are going to be difficult or expensive or even in some cases, impossible to electrify. And therefore, we feel like we need a clean molecule to help in those areas. And today, that's natural gas. But tomorrow, most promising molecule that we see is a green hydrogen molecule. And this looks like it's an opportunity for the company. It's another version of fuel for fuel at some level. set of government supportive of it. The states are supportive of it. And we've got two hydrogen hub applications. One in the Rocky Mountain region with MOUs from four states two of which we serve Colorado and New Mexico as well as Utah and Wyoming. And then here in the upper Midwest, five-state MOU, again, two of which three of it that we serve, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. And we're in front of the DOE, those have progressed through the process, and we expect to know by the end of the year, whether we're going to get duly loan -- grants for hydrogen. And I think you're aware of some of the challenges around what qualifies for a tax credit in hydrogen land. And I think there's sort of three areas of sort of debate. And what we're trying to do is balance cost to the customer and a need to accelerate OEMs to build and take us down the technology curve of electrolyzers and balance of plant. And I think about those as location generation matching and then additionality. So with respect to location, we've been -- in all three of those on one end, we think we need flexibility in all three of those categories. On the location, we've been supporting as a company, a balancing area type location, but certainly not national, which causes real market distortions and challenges with generation nationally. Similarly on matching, I think that the pure level would say we need hourly matching, but we probably need some transition period to get to that strict hourly matching. And so we've been supportive of some period of time where maybe by the end of the decade or late this decade, we've got hourly matching, but we'll go to annually matching for some period of time. And then with additionality, again, very supportive of the additionality as a concept but areas of flexibility there. One, we would really support nuclear in regards to additionality, and we have supported pretty vocally that as well as any sort of otherwise back down energy we would support that as additionality if it came back into the grid. And so very active -- we're very active at EEI, we're very active. And I think those are generally in line with principles that both of those organizations are supporting.
Paul Johnson: Steve, you asked about timing. The statutory deadline in August 22. And they haven't missed a statutory deadline yet, but what we're hearing is that there's still a lot of uncertainty around the position of it outlined given some of the polarizing viewpoints. So it certainly could slip into September or October.
Steven Fleishman: Okay, that is a lot of good information. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Paul Johnson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Hi, everybody. In terms of the $500 million insurance, what was the cost of that insurance and when was it occurred? And then I guess, going forward, are you seeing changes in pricing for wildfire-related insurance? And what's your strategy on a go-forward basis related to insurance?
Brian Van Abel: We haven't disclosed the cost, Ryan, and every year we renew our insurance program, and we continue to look at that. Insurance program is for everything is based on market experience for the insurance companies. And as you can imagine, it gets more challenged all the time, that's not just related to wildfire, but that's what all we have to say about insurance.
Ryan Levine: Have you already procured it in '23 for the next year? Or is that an upcoming event for the back half of the year?
Brian Van Abel: We're still in the process.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And I guess one last question on that. I mean, so the $500 million, any associated costs with procuring it. Is that passed on to ratepayers? Or is that embedded in your O&M cost outlook?
Brian Van Abel: It's recovered through rate cases, yes and it's included in O&M.
Ryan Levine: It's included in...
Brian Van Abel: It's included in O&M expense.
Ryan Levine: Okay, appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. As we have no further questions in the queue, I will turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand it over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations, to begin this conference. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our '23 first quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter results. We had another solid financial quarter, recording earnings of $0.76 per share for 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The increase in earnings largely reflects new revenue to recover our investments in clean energy and grid systems for the benefit of our customers. Our business plan is on track for the year, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share. This quarter, we continue to make progress on our industry-leading clean energy transition plans. We've received and reviewed a significant number of proposals in our pending solicitations for nearly 6,000 megawatts of new electric generation across multiple jurisdictions. We anticipate commission decisions on these various proceedings in the second half of '23 and remain confident in our ability to deliver a beneficial mix of both company-owned and third-party resources across those plans. We also continue to pursue the benefits and opportunities provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recently submitted multiple projects to the Department of Energy for funding consideration, including the multiparty Heartland and Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub and grid resilience investments in Colorado. In addition, we recently applied for DOE and venture capital grants for our long-duration energy storage proposals in Colorado and Minnesota and believe we are well-positioned to receive some or all of our requests. Our country and our company need new technologies, like long-duration storage, like hydrogen and clean fuels to commercialize in order to realize a clean energy future. And at Xcel Energy, we are actively working to do our part for the regions and the customers that we serve. And while the promise of a clean energy future is bright, we are keenly aware of the financial challenges that some of our customers experienced this winter with a significant rise in gas prices that we saw in 2022, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. Xcel Energy is proud of our long track record of keeping customer bills amongst the lowest in the country and to transition to a cleaner energy future with bill increases below the rate of inflation. We believe that affordability, reliability and sustainability can be realized concurrently through thoughtful energy policy and excellent operations. We've taken a number of steps in recent years that have saved customers' money and reduced exposure to commodity volatility. In our electric business, Xcel Energy's nearly 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be a leader in capacity factor performance and generated $1.1 billion of fuel-related customer benefits in 2022 and more than $3 billion since 2017. Future investments in renewable generation and clean fuels will continue to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and add further benefits to our customers. Since 2014, we've kept our operating and maintenance expenses nearly flat and well below inflation through our continuous improvement programs, which is a benefit that accrues to our customers' bills. Our numerous energy efficiency and demand management programs have saved enough energy to avoid building approximately 25 average-sized power plants. And in 2022, we disbursed a record $216 million in state and federal payment assistance funds to customers across our states, and we expect to exceed that record in 2023. Also, in partnership with Colorado Staff, Colorado Energy Office, Energy Outreach Colorado and the Utility Consumer Advocate, we proposed to the commission to increase funding to support income-qualified customers burdened by high energy costs. We expect to provide those increased benefits to our customers throughout 2023 and beyond. And with recent declines in natural gas prices, we proactively lowered our gas recovery mechanism in Colorado 4x, reducing customers' gas costs by 58%. Our customers in our other states are seeing comparable benefits. In Colorado, we've been working with stakeholders on proposed legislation regarding customer affordability, rate stability and the regulatory process. And finally, in addition to our energy efficiency programs, we are relooking at potential long-term solutions to reduce price volatility that could include physical and financial hedging, additional natural gas storage, long-term natural gas supply contracts, multiyear rate plans, natural gas cost deferrals, energy decoupling and the use of renewable energy to generate clean fuels for blending in the natural gas LDC. We are confident that if implemented, these actions can help reduce natural gas volatility in the future for our customers. As I wrap up, I'm pleased to share some of the company's recent recognition. For the tenth year in a row, we've been honored as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. We ranked first in social responsibility and quality of management, placing second overall amongst the most admired electric and gas companies in the country. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Xcel Energy has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. None of this will be possible without the commitment of our employees, contractors and our partners. And while we're proud of our track record and our accolades, we will never rest on our mission to provide our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy services at a competitive price. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, reporting earnings of $0.76 per share for the first quarter of 2023 compared with $0.70 per share in 2022. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas revenues increased earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting new revenue to recover investments in our electric and natural gas systems and clean energy infrastructure. A lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings-neutral. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.01 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest expense and other taxes which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6% for the first 3 months of 2023. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, driven by C&I sales, while we expect residential sales to be down slightly for the year. O&M expenses increased $48 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to timing differences associated with regulatory recovery mechanisms, generation outages and emergent work, inflationary pressures and investments in electric vehicle programs and other customer products. We continue to expect O&M to decrease approximately 2% in 2023 compared with last year. We've also made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. The commission recently approved our settlement in the Minnesota natural gas rate case, which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in the decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. In the Minnesota electric case, we received a constructive ALJ recommendation including a 9.87% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in June and final rates implemented in the fall. During the quarter, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $158 million based on an ROE of 10.65%, an equity ratio of 54.6% in the historic test year in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2024. Our electric rate case in Colorado is early in the process. Intervenor recommendations are due in May, and we'll see if there's a potential to reach a settlement with parties. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are expected in the fall. In our New Mexico electric rate case, intervenors filed an initial testimony. The staff recommended a forward test year with a rate increase of $37 million based on an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. Other intervenors recommended equity ratios in the range of 45% to 54.7% and ROEs between 8.7% to 9.6%. We anticipate a decision later in the year. Finally, later this month, we'll file a rate case in Wisconsin, seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of approximately $9 million based on a 10.25% ROE, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 future test year. We expect the commission to decide on the case before year-end with new rates in effect in January. Details on these cases are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We've updated our key assumptions to reflect the latest information, which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. Our customers continue to have some of the lowest bills in the country, we remain committed to keeping long-term bill growth below the rate of inflation while leading the clean energy transition and reducing customer exposure to volatility in fossil fuel prices. We continue to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes across our operating companies with progress across multiple rate cases. We have received a significant number of generation bids in response to our RFPs with additional RFPs forthcoming. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance, and we remain confident, we continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, guys, for the time. Appreciate it. Look, I wanted to talk about the proposed legislation and just efforts in Colorado to address the affordability, obviously, a lot of different comments out there. Can you set a little bit of your thoughts out there as to what the key tools and mechanisms and avenues that exist out there? And then ultimately, how to address some of the recovery issues and some of the perception issues?
Bob Frenzel : Yes. Julien, good to hear your voice on a Thursday morning. So we've been -- I appreciate your question. Look, as I think about legislation in Colorado that got introduced last week, pretty late in the session. We've been very keenly aware, as I said in my prepared remarks around the impacts to our customers from the volatility in natural gas prices that occurred largely last year and the declines that we've seen this year. And we've taken a lot of steps, both on the communications side and on the price mitigation side to assist there and obviously more to do. The legislation itself as proposed, was introduced in the Senate. And with the idea that we look at both price and price volatility that we saw over the past year, really with the benefit of our customers in mind, requires the company in the PUC. And again, this is still in -- it was approved by the Senate, I believe, yesterday, and it's going to go to the house maybe today or tomorrow. But requires a company in the PUC to look at all the mechanisms that can be helpful for our customers on price and price volatility. As I think about it, I think it provides tools on both the front end and the back end of the gas procurement cycle. So think on the front end, hedging and hedging tools, thinking -- rethinking about long-term storage, physical and financial hedging and things like that on the front end of the cycle. The legislation also takes a look at the back end of the cycle in the event that there are price volatility that exceeds a forecast, then we look at mechanisms for deferrals so that it may not be felt immediately in the pocket books of our customers. And I think those mechanisms much to be determined in the regulatory process, but the legislation contemplates those mechanisms being very beneficial to mitigate the volatility that we saw over the past year. I think the third piece of the legislation looks at something we've been already working with -- proactively with the commission on, which is incentive mechanism that provides an incentive to the company to meet or beat gas price forecast and manage the volatility for our customers. Again, lots of details that have to get worked through the regulatory process. But on balance, the intention is to really protect customers from the volatility we saw over the last year with regulatory mechanisms.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I hear you on that front. And then ultimately, as you think about this, mean just on the electric business, I mean, does this change anything in terms of procurement? Obviously, that could feed into some of those conversations. And then related on the gas side, any initial thoughts as to what this could mean from a financial perspective, maybe too early.
Bob Frenzel : Yes. Look, I think on the gas procurement side, it applied to procurement for both the electric and the gas business. More broadly speaking, it also looks at -- it asked us to do a cost causation study around gas LDC customers and how we make future long-term investments into the gas system allows for some distributed energy resources and the ability to add those to our systems maybe in a more expeditious manner. So there's some factors like that in the electric and gas, probably a little too early to say what the long-term implications on our capital forecasting are in the state, but I don't think it will be necessarily material in totality.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Julien, I would just add, we’re scheduled to file a clean heat plant in Colorado in August, which is really – I equate that to call it a resource planning process on the electric side. So really working through with our commission and our stakeholders is how do we do decarbonize the LDC. We have legislation with targets in 2030 and then a net zero target longer term. So we’re looking forward to working with all our stakeholders about how we decarbonize our LDC, and I think that’s a real opportunity as we put plans in place for a longer term.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Durgesh Chopra calling from Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Team, thanks for the update. I just wanted to -- I was going to ask you a question on Colorado, which you just answered. But just maybe can we get an update on the tax credits transferability? You have, what, $1.8 billion in the plan that is going to come from the tax credit transferability through 2027. Maybe just update us on your efforts there? And then can you remind us, I think you've disclosed this in the past, what are you assuming in terms of funds from that activity this year?
Brian Van Abel: Durgesh, thanks for the question. Something we're very focused on, not only transferability guidance, but guidance for the other aspects of the IRA. But specific to transferability on the guidance, we expect guidance to be issued in Q2 for transferability. And for us, we're looking for a fairly straightforward guidance, right? We would call it clean, no pun intended, a clean seller of these tax credits here from wind farms that have already been in service. And so we're looking for documentation and the certification requirements, in terms of sale, registration requirements, so pretty basic stuff. So that's really what we're looking for out of the guidance from the IRS. The other aspect is we've talked to about 20 counterparties already, and there is a significant amount of interest in the purchases of our tax credits, not only this year but for a longer term. So we're pretty confident in terms of our ability to execute on this at a good price for our customers. And so I think about this, we get guidance in Q2, I would expect us to start executing in Q3. And this year, we took a pretty conservative approach. We really expected to sell about $200 million of tax credits in our financing plan. That's about of half of what we could sell this year. So -- and then we'd assume we sell the remainder of it in the year after. But that's kind of our view on transferability and I think is a great mechanism as we think about the longer-term cost of renewable projects and how we can be the most tax efficient with those tax credits.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. And then just -- how will you announce like as you sell these tax credits, is that just going to be in your back half of the year earnings calls? Or are there going to be depending on how sizable these are other sort of 8-K type announcements any...
Brian Van Abel: No, I think we just included in our quarterly earnings calls. Obviously, there may be – depending on the counterparty, they may want to make some announcement about it if they’re thinking about – how they’re thinking about they’re supporting the clean energy transition by other counterparties may not want to. So – but the expectation would be in our quarterly earnings calls.
Operator: We'll now take questions from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing in the RFPs that you've got outstanding right now, how Xcel is competing. And if you're seeing cost increase or decrease just in terms of inflationary pressures or if some of these project proposals are coming in at more attractive prices?
Brian Van Abel: David, thanks for the question. So still working through the RFP processes, and I can comment on Colorado because we made a what we call a 30-day filing in Colorado that talked about the median prices that we've seen, incredible amount of interest in the projects and in the bid process. On the wind side, the median price was about $22 from an LCOE perspective. And if you think about that, that's -- if we didn't have IRA and we didn't have any tax credits that would probably be closer to $50. So a really great opportunity from a customer savings perspective with the IRA in what we're seeing. Now that's slightly above the RFP that we did 5 years ago, as you can see some inflationary pressures on CapEx. On the solar side, the median price is about $33. Now I'm giving you a median price. We have not disclosed the project portfolio that will happen in August when we make our filing and with our recommended portfolio to the commission. But overall, you think our project portfolio will come in well below those median prices that we've stated. So overall, I think we set ourselves up well with the number of bids we put in from a self-build perspective. We've been at the scheme for a long time from the wind side. And now we've proven with [Circle] solar and the price point we've delivered Circle solar that we can be very competitive. So I think, overall, we're excited about getting these RFPs. I talked about Colorado because that's the one that we've at least shared some information. Minnesota expect a filing from us here in May on the Minnesota RFP. And then on the SPS, RFP, expect a filing in Q3. So we'll give everyone kind of full transparency and visibility into the opportunities later in this year. But I would say, overall, we're pretty excited and excited to execute on some of these wind and solar and storage projects for the benefit of our customers.
David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Great. And then could you also give any more color just related to the water leak at the Monticello plant? What was the cost of the repair? Curious if you see any broader or more significant issues that popped up just in inspecting it. And then what's the status of the plant now and when it would be coming back online?
Bob Frenzel: David, it’s Bob. Thanks for the question. As we think about the water leak at Monticello, the repair costs were not significant. We – as we said in our releases, we have contained the leak, repaired the pipe are in the process of removing the water from the aquifer below the plant. There was no risk to people or planet in the process. We’re about halfway – close to halfway through that water removal, expect to finish it probably end of this year, early next. So not a material increase in the cost side. It’s really about pumping water out of the plants. The plants planned to shut down for refueling. We do refueling at Monticello every 2 years. And I expect they probably have 2 more weeks before they finish loading fuel and restarting the plant, but it is ready to go.
Operator: We'll now take questions from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to pivot to Minnesota a little bit, if I could. And I didn't know if you could share any other thoughts with regards to remaining priorities out of Minnesota electric ALJ recommendation there. Are there any particular points to address in the final stages of this rate case from your perspective?
Bob Frenzel : Sure. No, look, I appreciate the question. The process really continues. Since we last got together, we filed our -- the ALJ filed their recommendations at the end of March. We certainly didn't get all that we asked for in the ALJ filing, but as litigation goes, that's not atypical for the process. We'll file some exceptions and some things that the ALJ recommended we take up in a future proceeding or have the commission take up, I wouldn't say it's terribly material on the exception side. We haven't had a general rate case since 2016, prosecuted in the state on the electric side. And so we think that the recommendation from the ALJ was pretty thoughtful for all sides of the argument. And expect the commission to look at the ALJ's recommendation as well as some of the mitigation mechanisms that we put in place as a company to mitigate the impact to customers for having been out for a long time. We shall take it up in probably early June, and we expect the decision by the end of the second quarter.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And then just kind of pivoting towards MISO. Just as far as tranche 2 is concerned, what are you hearing there? Are there any updated thoughts from your side, what kind of -- what are current timing expectations for initial thoughts on CapEx potential there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I think we're thinking about it right now. And obviously, this is a little bit of a moving target with MISO, but we're thinking an announcement in the first part of next year. But like I said, that has the potential to shift as we've seen. And we're expecting kind of the next tranche or tranche 2 to be as big at lease as tranche 4, potentially bigger. And as we think about it, we'd expect a similar share as we received in tranche 1. So that's where our thoughts are today. But obviously, working with MISO and the stakeholders as we move through the process.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Last one for me. Just didn't know if you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on the hydrogen hub now that the applications are in, just any incremental thoughts you could share with us would be great.
Bob Frenzel: It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We -- look, I think as we think about the future and the future of hydrogen, I think the country really needs as we think about decarbonization across the economy, why we need a clean molecule for some of those harder to decarbonize sectors and hydrogen appears to be the most versatile of the clean energy molecules that we've been looking at. Certainly, the Department of Energy supports that through the hydrogen hub programs and in the IIJA. So we're excited about the application process. We expect decisions by end of year, where then we would go into future proposals around the proceedings. So we have two, one in the Rocky Mountain region, one in the upper Midwest region, both are consortiums with our multiple states and both involve the goal of creating what I think about as an ecosystem of both producers and users of a clean molecule like hydrogen and whether that can then be converted into fertilizer for ag, process heat -- burning for process heat and from our perspective, blending into the distribution system and co-firing in our existing natural gas plants. So we're excited around the versatility that the molecule provides. We appreciate what Congress and DOE are doing, and we look forward to progressing our applications at the DOE this year.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I’ll just add a little bit of more color on the process. I think overall, there is about 80 concept papers that were submitted, and DOE encouraged 33 concept papers and all 3 of ours were encouraged. Ultimately, as Bob said, we’ve moved forward with 2 because 2 were in the Rocky Mountain region. But we feel good about our, call it, multi-application hydrogen hubs and multistate hubs. So looking forward to seeing this process play out and as Bob said, awards at the end of the year, and then it’s a stage process going forward after that.
Operator: We'll now take question from Sophie Karp calling from KeyBanc.
Sophie Karp: Just a quick follow-up on the RFP process. Could you remind us if you're also bidding into those? And what do you expect your win rates to be, if any?
Brian Van Abel: Sophie. Yes, thanks for the follow-up question. We do -- so the way we see this playing out is we have absolutely submitted our own self-bid -- self-build projects in all 3 of the RFPs, Minnesota, Colorado and SPS. And those range from solar to wind and storage and combinations of each of those and depends on the RFP. Minnesota was only a solar RFP. But we've spent probably the last 18 to 24 months, working on our self-build projects. As we know, we have a massive renewable build-out over the next decade in our territories. So -- not only do we see potentially our own self-build projects being selected, we have a good partnership with Vestas in the Colorado with their Colorado facility. And so we have some geographical advantages with having wind turbine -- wind blades being manufactured there, and we have a lot of opportunities around. We're using the interconnection of our retiring coal plants. So we feel really good. Now, publicly, we talk about targeting 50% ownership. Obviously, we think we'll be very cost competitive and would love to demonstrate to our commissions that we could do more than 50% ownership because we think we have really good projects that will show a lot of benefit to our customers. And I think this is just -- as I think about this, let me give you a little view of longer-term. I really think this is a start of steel for fuel 2.0 as we think about it. And I don't think there are many utilities can do this clean energy transition at the price point that we can because of the solar and wind resources in our backyard. And we think that's a true competitive advantage over the longer term as being able to deliver 80% to 85% clean energy in 2030 at or below inflation. So we're excited to continue to work on these RFPs. And following these RFPs, we'll do multiple more RFPs in our jurisdictions. So I'm looking forward to giving you and everyone on this call and our stakeholders further updates as we work through the process.
Sophie Karp: Perfect. And then as a follow-up, maybe on the O&M. I see that the O&M has been a drag about like $0.06 maybe in the first quarter. Just wondering if that was impacted maybe by Monticello outage and repairs to a larger degree? And how do you see the shape of the O&M through the rest of the year?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks for the question. No, Monticello -- Monticello maybe a couple of million dollars from a repair cost perspective. So pretty immaterial relative to the quarter. As we think about it, last year, if you look at our pattern of O&M last year, it was significantly higher in the latter part of the year. Part of that is due to some regulatory deferrals that were in place of Q1 last year than unwound as we got rates in Texas. And then we also had good weather last year, so we invested in our system later in the year. So as we think about it, we're still good with our year-end guidance, and we'll continue to work on that. Now that being said, we are facing inflationary pressures and it's something that we're very focused on internally is keeping those O&M expenses down as I think is important from a customer build perspective long term. But overall, we feel good with where we are and expect to deliver on our year-end numbers as we've done for 18 years.
Operator: Next, we'll go to [Mr. Greg Orell] of UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a clarification around the transferability. Is it sort of the legal basis that you're looking for? Getting the clarification enables you to move forward. Or is there something that you're looking for in terms of the content?
Brian Van Abel: Not at all in terms of the content. I would call it we're looking for more administrative guidance. Now there may be other parties that are involved in tax equity partnerships or ITC, but we're looking at transferring PTCs, as I said, we're very clean from a transferability perspective. So it's more like okay, what are the registration requirements and then just our counterparties want to see the guidance too, so they know what they need to do. So nothing of our concern beyond just getting those administrative requirements out and that's why we're waiting, and we'll be ready to pull the trigger when we give that guidance.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ryan Levine calling from Citigroup.
Ryan Levine: On New Mexico, can you give some color as to what you're seeing in that regulatory process and compared to how the processes were with the prior commission? And is there any potential for settlement or change to the Q4 guidance, given the ramp-up of the new commission staff?
Brian Van Abel : Ryan, thanks for the question. As we think about it in New Mexico, a wide range of intervenor testimony. I think some of that from large industrials is call it par for the course. Look at the staff testimony, we think it's a good starting point, the staff testimony. I think one of the key aspects is we filed the forward test year. And I think there's support from a forward test year construct perspective, which is different from historical standards. So absolutely, just got the testimony in last Friday, have digested it, and then we'll see if there is an opportunity to work with the parties and reach a balanced and constructive outcome from a settlement perspective. If you look at the schedule we have -- hearings are June 20. And so that would be kind of from now until June 20, and it's actually a stipulation period in their native, in terms of looking at settlement opportunities. But we've been -- we've reached a settlement in our last couple of rate cases in New Mexico and certainly look forward to working with the parties on it to get a balanced outcome for our customers. The second part of your question was around guidance. This goes into effect late in the year, so relatively small impact on 2023 guidance.
Ryan Levine: Okay. But is the fourth quarter '23 decision, do you think that there's any risk to that timeline, from a regulatory timeline...
Brian Van Abel: No. From a timeline perspective, no, I do not. In terms of it getting pushed out.
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean, Ryan, the schedule has already moved out a month. So we think it's fine the way it is.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then on New Mexico, what are you seeing for weather-normalized load for that region?
Brian Van Abel: So I think overall, in SPS, if you looked at our sales is very strong sales on – particularly on the C&I side, right? We had 7% plus C&I sales quarter – year-over-year for the quarter. Resi sales were up about 3%. Now that was higher than expectations on the residential side. Commercial side was pretty much in line with what we expected. So really strong growth, and more of that growth is weighted towards New Mexico than Texas with what we’re seeing in the oil patch region in the Delaware Basin. Now rigs are up about 10% year-over-year from the rig count in the 2 counties we serve, Eddy and Lee. And then we’re also seeing a lot of electrification requests as the large oil and gas customers have their own carbon reduction targets hitting and they’re obviously working with the state of New Mexico is how they can improve their overall carbon footprint. So really good growth there, and we’re doing everything we can and working with our customers to make sure that we can support them with the distribution and transmission investments that we need to make.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Mr. Paul Patterson calling from Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: Can you hear me?
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Paul.
Paul Patterson: So just back to the Colorado bill, I apologize if I wasn't -- if I just didn't get this but are you guys -- I mean the bill is moving pretty quickly. Are you guys -- I mean, with the amendments that were done on Tuesday, are you guys okay with it at this point? Or do you look for additional changes in it? I apologize if you guys actually addressed this earlier.
Bob Frenzel : Paul, it's Bob. I didn't comment earlier but no new concerns there. We -- the bill as it passed the Senate and the amendments that were provided make the bill workable, I think, from our perspective. We continue to watch it as it moves through the house process. But as it stands right now, I think it's something that we can work with. We think if there still leaves a lot at the commission for decision-making, and we would very much work with the CPUC and the staff to implement some of that legislation through the regulatory process.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Great. And then given some of your management experience in California, and their sort of more novel idea of the commission -- the company's proposal to bill -- at least a part of the bill associated with income. I'm just wondering if that's something that you guys have thought about in any of your jurisdictions. But particularly Colorado given the experience in California. And just if you have sort of any feedback or any thoughts you might have about that.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think you’re talking about stratification of residential customers from an income perspective. I think at this point, what we do in that regard is we direct a lot of assistance through regulatory state and federal agency programs to mitigate the income-qualified customers. And that process, I think, has worked pretty well. I don’t see us proposing any changes to customer stratification at this point.
Operator: As we have no further questions, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Van Abel for any additional closing remarks. Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, everyone, for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thanks for your attendance. You may now disconnect. Have a good day. Goodbye.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Xcel Energy Year End 2022 Earnings Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. Questions will be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning we will review our 2022 results and highlights and share recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of our comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Frenzel.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. We had another very successful year at Xcel Energy, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. For our investors, we delivered EPS of $3.17 representing the 18th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance. In February, we raised our annual dividend for the 19th straight year increasing at $0.12 per share or 6.6%. More recently, in November, we extended our long-term investment plan which features a 10-year capital outlook with an approximate 7% rate base growth. We ranked in the top quartile in customer reliability or CAIDI and our residential electric builds are more than 20% below the national average. And amidst the backdrop of significant commodity increases this year, Xcel Energy's 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continue to be an industry-leader in net capacity factor performance, generated approximately $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 and almost $3 billion since 2017. Our nuclear fleet remains the top performing fleet in the country and achieved a capacity factor of 96% last year. We had an active regulatory year and resolved multiple rate cases and Uri storm cost recovery proceedings. The commissions in Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems through this decade. The Minnesota Commission approved our 460 megawatt Sherco Solar project. The Colorado Commission approved our $2 billion Power Pathway transmission project and MISO awarded us $1.2 billion of transmission projects and we accelerated our timeline for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal free by the end of 2030, all of which contribute to our leadership in clean energy transition for our customers. We continue to lead in carbon reduction as well. In 2022, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 52% below 2005 levels and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction across the company by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improves cash flow and credit metrics for the company and enhances the competitiveness of our renewable offerings. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing multiple new programs for our customers. We also filed comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. We've advanced our ESG leadership and have been recognized by multiple entities, including an upgraded rating by MSCI from AA to AAA. And finally, we were named among the world's most ethical, admired and responsible companies and we're recognized for being the best veteran employer as well as for our disability inclusion in the workplace. I'm really proud to lead a team that can deliver on operational, financial, environmental and diversity goals, all simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our resource plans, the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible community transitions as we retire our coal plants. We've recently issued a requests for proposals in Minnesota, Colorado and at SPS seeking approximately 6,000 megawatts of new renewable generation, a portion of the 10,000 megawatts that have been approved in our jurisdiction. We'll submit our recommended portfolios of generation assets to our commissions by the middle of this year and anticipate decisions in the second half of this year. We also expect to issue additional RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado this year and next year for the remainder of our approved needs. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that we have a geographical advantage in the clean energy transition due to the strong wind and solar resources in our service territory. This access to low cost renewable energy should also give us further advantage in developing green hydrogen and other clean fuel projects, which are becoming more feasible as a result of federal support from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the IRA. Late last year, we submitted hydrogen hub concept papers for both the Rocky Mountain and the Upper Midwest regions to the Department of Energy to compete for awards from the $8 billion hydrogen hub program. In December, we received favorable notice from the DOE for our concepts and we're encouraged to submit full applications in April. In addition, our pink hydrogen production pilot at our Prairie Island nuclear generating station is expected to be operational this year. Finally, we expect to bring forward opportunities this year to utilize clean fuels and green hydrogen blending at both our gas-fired generation stations and in our gas networks for Home and Building heating. As we continue to utilize innovative technologies to decarbonize our business, we are well-positioned to take advantage of potentially significant hydrogen capital investment opportunities in the future. As the penetration of renewable assets in our states increases, we're also interested in pursuing advanced storage opportunities to balance our electric system needs. Today, we're excited to announce a new partnership with Form Energy to develop two long-duration energy storage pilot projects. Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology could be a critical component to our decarbonization strategy providing the resiliency and reliability that we need on the system to support our significant renewable portfolio. We plan to deploy a 10 megawatt multi-day storage system at a retiring coal plant in both Minnesota and Colorado. These projects are expected to be online as early as 2025. And as we wrap up, I want to thank the thousands of employees who worked in below zero temperatures, and sustained high winds in several feet wet, heavy snow to keep the lights on and the houses warm during our recent winter storms. Your efforts exemplify our company values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. And I believe that our dedicated employees and partners are what distinguishes Xcel Energy with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks Bob. Good morning, all. We had another strong year recording earnings of $3.17 per share for 2022 compared with $2.96 per share in 2021. This represents EPS growth of 7.1%, slightly above our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. The most significant earnings drivers for the year included the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $1.05 per share, primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and riders to recover capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share, but keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense which reduced earnings by $0.40 per share reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense which decreased earnings by $0.24 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.23 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.12 per share. Turning to sales, our weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.8%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. We anticipate a modest slowing of our sales with growth of 1% in 2023. Shifting to expense, O&M expenses increased $170 million for the year, driven by cost related to technology and customer programs, storms, vegetation management inflation and additional actions due to weather. We also invested in our employees to ensure we retained our top talent. While we expect inflationary pressures to remain, we continue to focus on our continuous improvement programs, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency. As a result, we anticipate O&M expenses will decline approximately 2% in 2023. We’ve made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. In the Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and a property tax tracker. We anticipate the commission decision later this year. In the Minnesota electric rate case, the commission accepted our proposal to reduce our request for MISO capacity revenue and established a tracker. Hearings were completed in December and we continue to meet with the parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. However, we have a strong case and are comfortable with a fully litigated outcome absent this settlement. We anticipate a commission decision later in 2023. In November of 2022, we filed an electric rate case in Colorado seeking a net increase of $262 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2023 forward test year. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the third quarter. We also filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $78 million based on an ROE of 10.75%, equity ratio of 54.7%, the forecast test year in the early retirement of the total coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the fourth quarter. As far as future filings, we plan to file our Texas rate case later in the quarter and Wisconsin in the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant customer benefits, key elements include the following; tax credit transferability will provide $1.8 billion of liquidity increasing cash flow and reducing equity needs. We've met with companies in our service territory and expect to enter into bilateral tax credit sale contracts later this year. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by 100 basis points during the forecast time period. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improved the competitiveness of our renewable bids and we anticipate pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% due to the new and extended tax credits, which is great for our customers as we embark on this clean energy transition. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. We have updated our key assumptions to reflect actual year-end results which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We had a strong operational and financial year in 2022. We delivered 2022 earnings within our guidance range, the 18th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year. We received approval of our resource plans in Colorado and Minnesota, which will result in approximately 10,000 megawatts of new renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act has passed a significant benefits for our customers in the company. We are reaffirming 2023 guidance, consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. We remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is coming from Mr. Nick Campanella calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open, sir.
Nick Campanella: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, I guess just on the O&M and the '23 guide that really stuck out to us and I heard some of your comments in the prepared remarks just talking about continuous improvement. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more on what levers you're pulling that's leading to that O&M reduction and is this -- we are more one-time in nature to '23 or sustainable through the plan? Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Hi, Nick. Yes, good question. And a couple -- let me make a couple of points on it. One is a little bit of a function of where actuals in 2022 ended up in terms of updating our 2023 O&M guidance, but we're really proud of the continuous improvement efforts that we've had underway and they've been underway for a long-time from 2014 to 2021, we kept O&M flat and that's something I'm really proud of our employees who are doing and there is a really good benefit to our customers. We did have inflationary pressures in 2022 but also took actions given the good weather year to reinvest in 2022 in the system and our employees. As I think about 2023, a couple of things. One is, now we're investing a lot in technology and how do we make us more efficient in our plants, we have some of the digital operations factory which is really using AI in our plants to move from more reactive, proactive maintenance. We're investing significantly in, call it, real time scheduling in other opportunities to use AI. We also are starting to get on a treadmill of shutting down our coal plants, we have a broader coal unit a year that will start to shut down which provides us with a tailwind as we think not only in '23 but through basically the end of this decade in terms of as we lead this clean energy transition. And then we also do see some abatement of, call it, the high diesel costs, we had a storm year that was above normal in 2022, for example, we had quintuple the number of storm days in December. So there are some things that happened in '22 that won't happen in '23 that should help us achieve it. So, a long answer, but a lot there to unpack and hopefully that helped provide some color on it.
Nick Campanella: Yes, that's great. Thank you so much. That's helpful. And on the Minnesota Electric case, it sounds like you're confident in taking this the full distance to an order. But I just wanted to be clear, is the settlement more unlikely at this point and how should we be thinking about that taking into consideration, where we are in the docket today?
BobFrenzel: Nick, it's Bob, thanks for the question. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we filed this case over a year-ago, we probably actively working with parties since the September timeframe and we've reduced our total initial ask dramatically through extension of asset lives through the MISO capacity revenues and for bringing down the actual sales that we experienced in the state. So we think that reduced revenue ask is really a tailwind for us in the case, there's probably some pretty decent -- recent decisions in Minnesota, you saw the Minnesota Power case the other day and our gas settlement that Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks are data points that we feel confident in taking this, as you say, all the way, but we're always open to engaging with all the parties and if there is an opportunity to move forward with a settlement, we would certainly think to do so.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We now go to David Arcaro calling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Thanks so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you might be able to give any preview of what we could expect from the Clean Heat Plan filing later this year in Colorado, whether there might be potential CapEx investments additions to the plan and what new technologies and opportunities that might be to invest there?
BobFrenzel: Hi, David, it's Bob. That's a great question. Look, we're excited about the Clean Heat Plan opportunity, it's really an opportunity for us I think to share and align our vision for a net zero future on the gas business with our commissions in a more formal way. I'm not certain that I would expect to see a significant amount of sort of new investment opportunities as part of that process, but really an opportunity to align on our multipronged strategy to decarbonize the gas business. As I think about it, we're working with upstream providers to reduce methane on the purchase gas that we buy for our customers. We're working on our own system, we have been for over the past decade in methane leak reduction, we've done a terrific job there, but there is always more to work to tighten up our own system and then we work on customer programs that encourage energy efficiency that encourage maybe fuel switching and beneficial electrification and then I think the big opportunity from an investment perspective is really the comments I made around clean fuel in my prepared remarks. We are working with multiple parties in the Colorado jurisdiction on a Rocky Mountain hydrogen hub, we think it's a really attractive project, a multistate MOU has been signed with several of the Western states and the governors and all the energy offices of those states are working together. So I think clean fuel's a real opportunity for us and for our customers to advance the clean energy transition and to help us realize a net zero future in the gas business.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, David and I'd just add a couple of points there. One is, we don't have anything in our current five-year plan related to hydrogen investment opportunities. So to the point, if there's an opportunity to pull that forward and move faster on hydrogen, absolutely an upside opportunity as we think about it over the next five years. But also lot of, call it, industry discussion about natural gas commodity cost and the volatility we think longer-term now us owning renewables and creating green hydrogen blending it into the LDC creates more price certainty for our customers and takes that volatility out, so I think that's a longer-term opportunity and benefit as we think about how do we help our natural gas customers and improve the certainty of our overall bills.
BobFrenzel: And then just broadly, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks was probably worth saying again, which is, we are benefited by the geography that we sit in having great access to low cost wind and low cost solar, not only should we be able to do this for our customers beneficially but you're looking at opportunity of making the Rocky Mountain region or the upper Midwest regions, energy exports centers where we're creating a product that can be broadly transmitted to the rest of the country whether that's electricity via wire or whether that's green hydrogen via pipe or trucking, we should be a destination for those installations which overtime should help economic development in our states and add to employment backlogs as well.
David Arcaro: That's really helpful color. Thanks for that, lot of initiatives, it sounds like related to that program that you'll be rolling out. And then separately on the announcement with Form Energy and long-duration storage, it's nice to see that crystallizing here. I was wondering if you might have a sense for how much long-duration storage might make sense on your system over time? Is there a certain number of megawatts or a proportion relative to your generation fleet that might make sense. Wondering how you might see the scale up to the extent these initial projects are successful and make it through the regulatory process?
BobFrenzel: Yes, thanks, David. As we go through resource plans with each of our states, we find that we have increasing need for as we have higher penetration of renewals and increasing need for, what we'll call, dispatchable energy resources, and historically, those would have been combustion turbines maybe they are fired with a clean fuel like hydrogen or synthetic natural gas. Over time as long-duration storage might become more feasible and cost effective, you can see duration -- long-duration storage being a part of that solution, and I think if I were to add-up and I'm going to do this math on the fly, but we have several thousand megawatts in our resource plans for firm dispatchable generation. And if we had an asset, lithium-ion batteries are interesting and they have a utilization for our systems, but so do the long-duration storage. These are 20 megawatts projects, there's probably several hundreds in our resource plans that could be realizable within the next five to 10 years if the technology proves out.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, and I would just add to that, we're really excited about this technology, shows that we're leading and really demonstrating that we're on the forefront of this clean energy transition and we've always talked about we know how to get to our 2030 goals of 80% plus carbon reduction and so this is really about taking that last 15% to 20% out of the sack and providing one of the solutions. So if you think about that and when you look at our resource mix in 2030, you can start to size what do we need to do beyond that in terms of storage capabilities that will be one of the solutions.
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. We now go to Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's actually Rich [indiscernible] on for Jeremy. Thank you for the time today. Maybe starting with changes to one of your drivers. I know we hit O&M already but just curious if you can parse the full range of what are effectively true-ups for '22 actuals versus new expectations for '23, are any of these changes you're putting in higher or lower within the guidance range at this point in time?
BobFrenzel: I'll just read up to start, right, we're still feeling our midpoint of the guidance range, early in the year is where we expect to be and in terms of specific changes, right, gas sales is up a little bit, but that's really a function of where we landed on the year-end and really gas sales for us 1% is less than $5 million in terms of a change. The increase in the rider revenue that's a function of we had a good wind in PTC year in 2022, so that's relatively earnings neutral, we do see a little bit of a benefit depreciation and interest expenses lower. Let's see the forecasted rates for 2023 are lower than in Q3. But overall, we look at it is relatively neutral as we think about the puts and takes and so we're now targeting midpoint of the guidance range and now looking-forward to having a discussion 12 months from now and our goal is to deliver for the 19th straight year.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color there. And then turning back to Colorado and a lot of their focus on the gas system planning side that you addressed this a little bit from the Clean Heat Plan perspective, but I'm curious for your higher level thoughts on how this might impact your electric operations in state as well?
BobFrenzel: Hi, Rich, it's Bob. Look, I did mentioned as part of our Clean Heat Plan in our long-term strategy for decarbonizing on behalf of our customers that we do expect some amount of beneficial electrification to happen whether that's water heaters or cooking or home heating, but we believe that the asset value of the distribution system is incredibly valuable for our customers and has the ability to deliver a significant amount of energy on the coldest days in Colorado, our design temperature that we planned for in Colorado is minus 30, so it's still a very cold weather climate, has a need for a very efficient delivery system which we believe the pipeline system is there. Now, I do think that we can put -- as part of our strategy is to look at clean fuels and green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas and the opportunity that presents for our customers to realize a good product at an affordable price, that's also sustainable, it's important. But electrically, with EV's and beneficial electrification as we think about the future of our electric business in Colorado, there's probably growth there that's driven by both of those aspects.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now move to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning, team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity, nicely done. So Brian just on the -- so, just first on bills, I just want to understand a little bit on the trajectory of bills, can you talk a little bit on what the rate increases are in customers this winter especially on the gas side? And then also just given the cresting that we've seen in some of the commodity prices here, how is that setting itself up to ultimately get reflected to back to your customers, if you think about the cadence of your hedging programs?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Hi, Julien. Good question, and we think about -- I'll talk a little bit about both sides of the business because we think about on the electric side really well-positioned from overall customer bill perspective. Now we're, call it, 85% electric and if you just look at our income statement and the cost of goods sold and fuel impacts on the electric side is modest given the inflationary environment we saw in 2022, Bob talked about it, right, it's really -- it's our wind build out that we've always talked about been the hedge for rising commodity costs and that's played out in 2022 and really good to see from a customer bill perspective. And also we went into the year, being on a national average, more than 20% lower on residential customer per bill. So, good place and a good place to be on the electric side. Obviously, on the natural gas LDC side, you have a lot fewer levers and lot fewer assets. And so you saw some of the headlines of 40% to 50% bill impacts for our customers, obviously, we do not like to see any sort of bill impacts of that magnitude, but you're absolutely right that that is starting to subside with where natural gas prices are going. And if you caught it, we've just, in the past two months, we’ve twice updated our gas commodity clause in Colorado which lowered the gas -- the commodity portion of the customers' bills by about 30% that will start to feel in Q1 relative to Q4 because we're actually going to be over collected, so we proactively did that and the commission was appreciative of that. So we're certainly taking every opportunity we can to make sure that we have reflecting the lower commodity costs in our customers. So that's really where we see, I think longer-term, we feel really good about delivering bills at the level of inflation as we think about 2030 and beyond and what the IRA is doing for us and for our customers. So we feel good both near-term and longer-term as we think about it.
BobFrenzel: Hi, Julien. I'll agree with everything Brian said and add, if you look at the long arc of history and look-forward over the last 10 years and into the next 10 years. I think that comment around bills at or below the inflation level is consistent on the electric and gas side, this has been a tough year on the gas side, we're empathetic and we've worked hard with the federal government to enable significant amount of -- record amounts of why heap and then actively getting that into people's hands that needed the most. Longer-term, clean-energy transition, I think we can do this as we said, because we are strategically advantage in our position, we can do this very cost-effectively across the country and we have a good starting point in total bills and what our customers feel 20% below the national average or more in our residential electric areas. And our gas business, I think you highlighted this in one of your reports is one of the top two or three lowest gas businesses in the country. So good starting point, but it doesn't mean we don't have work to do and obviously we're always empathetic to our customers who are feeling bill increases at the grocery store, at the fuel pump, at rents and mortgage payments and everything else. So, but thanks for the opportunity to talk about it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. You bet, hi listen, just going back to one of the questions from earlier. On the settlement conversations versus fully litigated cases obviously with curve backdrop is an ideal for having rate increases altogether. Can you talk a little bit about expectations we will settle cases broadly speaking here, to what extent could Minnesota be an isolated data point in the current instance given the current fact pattern or are you seeing challenges more broadly, here again without pointing fingers at specific statements necessarily?
BobFrenzel: Well, I'll start Julien and Brian can add-on if he's got anything to add. I think generally, we look for settlements. I think we're encouraged to look for settlements. I even think as you look at some of the recent data points in Minnesota, the commission is looking for settlement. So with that as backdrop, maybe this case is isolated, maybe we saw the path to reach a settlement with the parties and I think we're being encouraged to do so. I think broadly speaking, that's the case for most of our jurisdictions, and most of our staff, we need to make sure that we are delivering for our customers operationally, we're delivering for our customers and reliability, but we also need to make sure that we keep a financially healthy utility, credit metrics are really important preserving credit metrics and our operating companies is critical as we seek to raise capital cost advantageously and to deliver on the capital investment profile that we know we need to do. So, I think there is where the debate happens and again I think we've got a long track record of settling and so I would take your comment as encouraging to think that we're going to continue to settle cases going-forward.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now take questions from Travis Miller calling from Morningstar. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Miller: Obviously you had a good year with the C&I demand, wondering what's your outlook in that 1% total sales for C&I we see another big year or does that moderate a bit?
Brian Van Abel: Hi, Travis. Yes, I can take that one. No, I think we continue to see similar to what we saw in 2022 where strong growth in the C&I, if I parse it out, we have -- what we're expecting is about 2% up in C&I for 2023 and about a 1% decline in residential rate, continued decline from the COVID levels that we saw the increase in residential. C&I particularly good growth in SPS and I think just under the 2022 sales, when you look at the C&I numbers, you see that Colorado C&I is negative, but if you actually make an adjustment, we helped a large customer installed 240 megawatts solar farm to ensure that they stated in Colorado, ensured those jobs stayed in Colorado. And so if you made that adjustment Colorado C&I would actually have been a plus 2% for the year. So strong economic activity in C&I growth across all of our service territories, we expect that albeit a little bit of slowing in 2023 but to remain there.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. And then a follow up to the hydrogen hub discussion, I think if I heard you correctly, April was the next point in which you file some more information, at what point is it there or is it later on where you get start getting a sense for given your proposal of non-approval that a proposal for CapEx potential spending?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Travis, I think it's early innings with the departments. April is the next filing date for, I'll call it, full plans, I think the Department of Energy is looking at probably around two dozen. So it's going to take them a while to parse through that in award grants for the -- I'm going to guess four to six that move forward from that perspective. We think both of our projects are incredibly interesting, provide lots of regional benefits from multiple sources and multiple users, which I think is a criteria that the department is going to look at. But if you're going to ask me to guess, I'd say it's at least end of next year before we get any clarity on those April applications potentially longer.
BobFrenzel: Yes, but expect us that's the hydrogen hub concept, which we're very interested in and I think we have a great opportunity to be significant participants, but also expect us to move forward with hydrogen pilots and opportunities both on the electric side and the gas side as we think about working through our Clean Heat Plan in Colorado, our Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota and then also on the electric side as we think about how do we decarbonize the last 15% to 20% in our stack.
Travis Miller: Sure, okay. End of next year being 2024?
BobFrenzel: Correct.
Travis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick on that, how many partners are in those two proposals, Rocky Mountain, Midwest proposals?
Brian Van Abel: I think we'll get back to the specific number, Travis, but I'm going to guess it's in the five to 10 in each region.
Travis Miller: Okay, let's just looking for a rough number. Okay, very good. That's all I had. Thanks.
BobFrenzel: Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now take questions from Mr. Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Paul Patterson: So, I hear you on the Minnesota regulatory environment, it's pretty much what I've been hearing. But one thing I was little surprised by or I just -- it's hard to keep track of everything, there were some articles about some sort of state goal being below the national average by 5% and I think industrial's made a filing about this sort of saying that the rates are in danger or what have you about being in line with that policy. And I was just wondering, could you just refresh my memory about what is state policy goal is and sort of following-up on Julien's question, that's just sort of the trajectory -- how you see those performance within that thing going-forward because we have changes and moderation in fuel prices are going forward, just you're do not moving pieces I guess I'm just sort of wondering if you could -- and frankly I'm just not up to speed on the wall that they're talking about?
Christopher Clark: Hi, Paul, this is Chris Clark. I'm the President of our Minnesota company. Yes, there is a goal and statute that seeks to have our prices for our commercial and industrial class, be within 95% of the national average. I think the starting point here is really that we provide our customers a great value and I think the look that got some attention is simply a look at the rate. But if you actually look at our total bills for our C&I class, you'll see that over a 10-year period, they've been relatively flat and that's because the EIA data that gets pulled for rates is only one component of the bill. So I think when you look at what we achieved for our C&I class, if you take into account the conservation programs that have been really nation leading here in Minnesota and other credits, and things that those customers have done to be successful, you'll see that our C&I class rates are competitive, and in fact, we do a great job of attracting new business to our state. So, I think it's important when we look at the picture of how we're doing with our C&I rates and really take that into account. And as Brian and Bob have said, when we look at the plans for our clean energy transition, we're confident that we can deliver those results in line or less than CPI. And I think over the long-term, we've shown that we can continue to be a successful company and navigating this, keeping rates affordable for our customers and delivering great value.
Paul Patterson: Okay, also a great answer that. The second question, I have -- and I apologize if I missed this I got just interrupted here. The iron battery deployment, I apologize if you've already discussed this but are you just going to own these and what's the cost of them or could you just give a little bit more flavor of the economics associated with these two projects?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, good question. No, we haven't disclosed the cost of these batteries, yet. We haven't made the regulatory filings yet and we are looking forward to having a discussion on our stakeholders and the commission, but we certainly will O&M, we think there are a valuable grid asset and important to us to own them as we think about how do we start to deploy these new technologies as we look to decarbonize and get to 100% carbon-free. So obviously, with any new technology the cost of more expensive, but this is a 100 hour battery that we don't see other solutions out there that are viable and it also iron oxide, right, if you think about rare metals, this is something that's readily available as we think about supply chains and what's the ability to scale. So overall, we're pretty excited about this. I think it demonstrates our leadership as an innovative clean tech company and we're excited to work with our commissions, but certainly more to come in terms of disclosing the cost.
Paul Patterson: Okay, great. Just any idea when you guys might make regulatory filing roughly speaking?
Brian Van Abel: Later this year, it will be this year.
Paul Patterson: Okay. I mean, you guys are deploying in 2025, right, so?
Brian Van Abel: Yes.
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. Our next question is coming from Mr. Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead, sir.
Anthony Crowdell: Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just hopefully two quick ones. I guess when you look at the four major rate filings you guys have, they're all asking for a forward test year. When we look at 2023 and beyond, what do you think is a reasonable assumption for structural lag? Can that be reduced from say 90 to a 100 basis points to maybe 50, 60?
Brian Van Abel: Hi, Anthony, good question. As we think about it from an earned ROE perspective, that's always been a goal of ours, right, we had a goal in 2015 to hold it from 100 to 50 bps and we're successful. And then in 2018, '19 and then had some COVID hit and we scale back on regulatory filings. I think as we look forward, our goal is to close that and we had some success from 2021 to 2022, albeit modest about 15 bps. And so our goal is to continue to focus on closing that and probably that 50 basis point range as you mentioned is a good goal as we think about it going forward and something that we're always focused on improving the regulatory constructs in getting now as we think about either multiyear plans or longer-term plans really providing the benefit of price to our customers, I think is really important something we'll continue to forward work through.
Anthony Crowdell: Great. And just one follow up on top of Julien's question. I think Bobby had mentioned you prefered the settlement route and not just specific to Minnesota, but just in general. It seems like lately some commissions may be or tinkering with settlements if I use that term, it seems that's maybe turning at a greater frequency, does that give you pause on achieving your settlement?
BobFrenzel: Hi Anthony, it's Bob. Great to see your name in the inbox today. Now, it doesn't give me pause look, I think we've had a long history here. We continue to work proactively with staffs and commission. And sometimes we go before ALJs and there's always things that are around the edges, important, but I think generally speaking settlements are encouraged and I think commissions understand that they want to encourage settlements that they need to be respect the entirety of them without tinkering. I think you've seen some commentary in some of the jurisdictions you might have been thinking about to that fact.
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. And as it appears to have no further questions, Brian I'd like to the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow up questions.
Operator: Thank you so much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your attendance and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. After the presentation, we will open up for questions. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations.  I will now hand the call over to Paul Johnston, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others in the room available to answer questions if needed.  This morning, we will discuss our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plans and provide 2023 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.  Today, we will discuss certain measures that are non-GAAP metrics. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for 2022 compared to $1.13 per share in 2021. Our earnings are on track, and as a result, we are narrowing our '22 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating 2023 earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective.  Consistent with past practices, we've updated our base investment plan, which reflects $29.5 billion of capital expenditures over the next 5 years. This investment plan provides significant benefits to our customers, supports community vitality and resiliency and delivers rate base growth of 6.5%.  We're very excited about our investment plans, which support continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our generation fleet transition, allows for the electrification of transportation, keep customers' bills low and delivers attractive returns for investors. And while our base plan is robust, it does not include any potential renewable generation assets that are approved in our Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, or additional transmission capital is needed to integrate new renewable generation in Colorado beyond the Power Pathway Project. For these assets, we expect further regulatory clarification in the second half of 2023, which could result in incremental capital expenditures of $2 billion to $4 billion, which would result in rate base growth of 7.6% at the midpoint. Our updated capital plan, which reflects the benefits of the IRA, extends the growth rate and improves the quality of rate base, reduces financing risk, improves credit metrics, and delivers substantial customer and environmental benefits.  During the quarter, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed into law, which includes new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, carbon sequestration and nuclear. It also includes tax credit transferability. Some of the key takeaways for the IRA include substantial customer benefits and a continuation of our clean energy leadership while keeping customer bills affordable. The inclusion of the new solar production tax credit makes our company-owned projects more affordable for our customers relative to the solar ITC. The hydrogen production tax credit should improve our competitive advantage in delivering low-cost, clean fuels for our combustion turbines for electric reliability and for blending into our local gas distribution systems that will help our customers lower their carbon footprint in the future. The nuclear production tax credit will provide additional customer credits depending on MISO marginal pricing thereby lowering the cost of electricity from our existing nuclear assets. The tax credit transferability will increase liquidity and improve credit metrics. An excellent example of the IRA tax benefits is our 460-megawatt Sherco Solar proposal that was recently approved by the Minnesota Commission with strong stakeholder support. This will be the largest solar facility in the Midwest and a top 5 installation in the United States, which will go into service in 2024 and 2025.  Following the IRA passage, the levelized cost of Sherco solar is projected to decline by over 30%, even after accounting for inflation and supply chain pressures. Due to the project qualified for both solar PTCs and community energy bonus as we are reinvesting in the community around our retiring coal facility. This is a substantial benefit to our customers.  Earlier this year, the commissions in both Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10, 000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. These resource plans were approved prior to the passage of the IRA, but the final recommended portfolios are expected to capture the benefits of the IRA which will significantly reduce the levelized cost of these renewable projects for our customers. We've issued a request for proposal in Minnesota and plan to issue an RFP in Colorado later this year. After evaluation of proposals, we anticipate submitting our recommended portfolios to our respective commissions by the middle of next year and expect decisions in the second half of next year. We expect the recommended portfolios of generation assets will include a mixture of self-build, build-own-transfer projects as well as some power purchase agreements.  Our generation resource plans are consistent with our Steel for Fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. As an example, our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and almost $3 billion since 2017. While these fuel savings were not included in our investment case, it shows the tremendous customer benefits of being an early leader in the clean energy transition. We also continue to advance our broader ESG leadership as MSCI recently upgraded Xcel Energy's rating from AA to AAA and categorized our company as leader in their nomenclature for managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. It's is an outstanding accomplishment and reflects our continued progress, including adopting a water management goal, greater disclosure of human capital management practices and an improved governance score. We were also named to investor business daily's 100 best ESG companies, which is further recognition of our ESG leadership.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, recording earnings of $1.18 per share for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $1.13 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.33 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.07 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to our sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.2%, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. The year-to-date results are relatively consistent with our expectations of 2% sales growth for 2022, while we anticipate more modest sales growth of 1% for next year.  Shifting to expense. O&M expenses increased $43 million for the third quarter, driven by investments in technology and customer programs, storm costs, vegetation management and inflation. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 4%. This represents a step increase due to cost pressures. However, we anticipate flat O&M in 2023.  We made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. During the quarter, Minnesota Commission approved our Yuri storm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of a $19 million disallowance. We have now resolved Yuri cost recovery in all of our states with the exception of Texas. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. And in a natural gas rate case, we reached a comprehensive settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57%, a currently authorized equity ratio of 52.5%, a decoupling mechanism and property tax tracker. We think this is a constructive settlement and anticipate a commission decision next year.  In the Minnesota electric rate case, we recently received intervener testimony. The Department of Commerce recommended a 3-year rate increase of $274 million based on an ROE of 9.25% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In addition, the Department of Commerce recommendation reflects customer credits for the MISO capacity auction revenues and extension of the depreciable lives of the Monaco nuclear plant and our wind farms. We are meeting with parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement.  In October, the Colorado Commission approved a rate increase of $64 million for our natural gas case, reflecting a historic test year with the year-end rate base and $16 million of incremental depreciation expense. The commission also approved a weighted average cost of capital of 6.7%, which will reflect as an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 53.8% based on the ranges they provided. As a result of the Colorado Commission denying the step increases, we are evaluating options of filing another rate case as the natural gas business remains a critical part of the energy infrastructure in Colorado that is valued by our customers. As far as future filings, we plan to file Colorado and New Mexico electric rate cases later this year and the Texas rate case in the first quarter of 2023. As Bob mentioned, we've issued a robust $29.5 billion 5-year base capital forecast with a rate base growth of 6.5% using 2022 as a base. The base plan reflects significant grid and resiliency investment, our Colorado Power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our Sherco Solar facility. It also includes natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience.  We also anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 3,500 megawatts of additions from 2024 to 2027, which would result in capital investment of $1.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for an incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we can see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $2 billion to $4 billion. We've updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of cash generation, debt and equity to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. The financing plan assumes $1.8 billion of tax credit transfers which improves our credit metrics, maintains a strong balance sheet and lowers the cost of renewable projects for our customers. Compared to our previous 5-year plan, transfer ability to reduce equity needs to $750 million, while we've increased CapEx by $3.5 billion. In addition, we anticipate that any incremental capital will be financed at roughly our current capital structure.  It is important to recognize that we've always maintained a conservative financing strategy, which reflects a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, a balanced financing plan and minimal levels of variable debt and longer maturities. This approach is critical in the current market of rising rates and will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. Bob discussed IRA customer benefits, but I wanted to add a few more details. Tax credit transferability is projected to provide $1.8 billion of liquidity, which increases cash flow and reduces our equity needs. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by approximately 100 basis points during the forecast time period, even after adding $3. 5 billion of capital and reducing equity needs. The solar PTC and tax credit transferability improve the competitiveness of our renewable bids. We project the IRA will drive approximately $500 million of customer savings from our owned renewable projects over the next 5 years and nuclear PTCs could drive additional savings. We anticipate that pricing will decline on solar projects by 25% to 40% and wind projects by 50% to 60% later in this decade due to new and extended tax credits along with potential adders in the IRA. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers’ depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. We're also narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $3.14 to $3.19 per share. We're also initiating our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release.  With that, I'll wrap it up with a quick summary. IRA was passed with significant benefits for our customers in the company. The Minnesota Commission approved our Sherco Solar project. We reached a constructive settlement in our Minnesota natural gas rate case. The Colorado Commission approved our natural gas rate case. We're narrowing our 2022 earnings guidance range. We announced our robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2023 guidance consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. And we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep those low for our customers.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.
Nicholas Campanella : So I guess I'll just start it off. I mean, you're raising CapEx, you decreased equity needs. The CAGR is still the same. Can you just give us a sense of kind of what the offsets are in that plan. I believe that there is some offset to rate base with transferability in the various tax impacts, but any more clarity would be helpful.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. Absolutely, Nick, and I'll handle that one. Yes. I mean when we look at the IRA, huge win for our customers and us. And really -- and when we think about our financing plan, it's around transferability. And there is an offset because a majority of those tax credits were on our balance sheet as a deferred tax asset, which would increase the cost of our renewable projects. So by being able to monetize them, we reduced that tax asset on our balance sheet, lower the overall LCOE for our wind projects and solar projects to our customers and improve our cash flow. So you do have lower rate base from that in a vacuum but it allows us to reduce our equity needs, increase CapEx and have basically a higher quality rate base as we think about it. Much of the steel in the ground and the tax assets on our balance sheet.
Paul Johnson : And Nick, just as a clarification, those Tax credits are not currently on our balance sheet, but they would have been on our balance sheet without tax credit transferability in the future. 
Nicholas Campanella : Got it. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then in the electric rate case in Minnesota, if I heard you correctly, I think you're engaging parties for a possible settlement. Can you just kind of give us a sense of overall confidence level and just getting it across the finish line? And then is there a drop dead kind of date that you need to get this done by if you were to? Like is there a hearing date we should have in mind?
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Nike, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, I think on the Minnesota electric case, first and foremost, we've got the gas case behind us, and that sets a good framework for some of the items in the electric case. We're engaged with parties, I think rebuttal testimony as to in the middle -- or the hearings are in the middle of December. So I think we should target that as a deadline for settlement opportunities.
Operator: We will now take the next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Maybe sticking on the regulatory arena, wondering on the Colorado gas rate case, when might be the next time you go in just in the wake of this recent decision? 
Bob Frenzel: David, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We filed the case back in January with the commission, and we're looking for a 3-year forward gas case. We have expected capital expenditures continuing next year and the year after, and we have real visibility into the case -- sorry, the commission granted us a historic test year case, means we likely need to go back in sometime in 2023 for a new gas case.
David Arcaro: Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And then the other thing I wanted to check on was what's your latest thinking about the prospects for PPA buyouts and repowering opportunities in the wake of the IRA? Does that become a bigger opportunity for you to look at now?
Brian Van Abel : Yes. Yes, I'll take that one. I think it absolutely does. And the way I think about it, it extends our PPA buyout opportunity for a long time, right? What we've been successful at, we bought out about $750 million of PPAs over the past number of years. And we were successful because we brought forward a win for our customers ,a win for us, right? We were able to buy out a PPA, put steel in the ground and save our customers' money. And we did that by buying out the PP and repowering it and qualifying for new set -- new strip of tax credits on the wind side.  So pre IRA, the buyout opportunities were stepping down as your tax credit stepped down. Now since we have a 10-year-plus runway of PTCs and also, we'll look at evaluating solar buyout opportunities, if you can repower on a solar PTC farm. So I think there's a much longer runway for buyout opportunities. And none of that is our capital forecast is in our 5-year plan as upside.  And I think that longer term, as you think about repowering, as you mentioned repowering is we put over 3,000 gigawatts or 3,000 megawatts of wind in service between '18 and '21. And we'll look at potentially repowering those in 2028, 2029, 2030 and save our customers' money, like we're doing with our 4 wind repowerings in Minnesota right now. So I think this really extends our opportunity on the PPA buyout and our own repowering opportunities.
David Arcaro: Yes. That's helpful color. It seems like a big opportunity. Any just visibility into timing or clarity as to when those could crystallize in terms of hitting the CapEx plan?
Brian Van Abel : I think what we could potentially see in the Colorado, like we talked about potentially seeing bids in the RFP and the Minnesota RFP is focused on solar. The Colorado 1 will be an all-source RFP so we could potentially see something in that RFP that we'll launch later this year that Bob mentioned, will -- you'll get visibility in call it, mid to later next year, could be the first time. Because when we were middle of kind of the resource plan and RFP processes, we want to follow those and make sure we align with the other acquisitions. So that's probably the first time I'd look at it. Longer term, it's much more opportunistic, right? You got to find a developer that is willing to transact at a price that's beneficial for our customers.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Brian Van Abel : Jeremy, nice headline.
Jeremy Tonet: Just with life in the fastlane, just wondering -- thank you for all the details today on CapEx, but what could be incremental maybe on the horizon here, if I dare kind of asked what more could come in over time? And specifically, thoughts on additional MISO opportunities, whether that's competitive or upsizing future LRT portfolios?
Bob Frenzel: I appreciate the question. A couple of things. Brian highlighted what we would call incremental capital that we've been talking about for the better part of the year. And this is the competitively bid generation in both Minnesota and Colorado, as well as the incremental transmission that we would need on the power pathway in Colorado to integrate those renewables. That opportunity is $2 billion to $4 billion. At the midpoint of that, we probably have rate base growth in the mid-7s.  Additional to that, things -- early things we're starting to think about, I mean, you heard the previous caller's comments around PPA buyouts and repowerings that’s certainly in our sites. We haven't put bookends around those for the community, but we certainly will. Secondly, as we think about generation in our Southwestern service territory, I think with the IRA, we see economics in solar and wind down there that can make an acceleration of renewables in the SPS territory, also not in our plan would be towards the back end of the 5-year plan, maybe in the middle of the 10-year plan.  We're still evaluating our resiliency expenditures. We feel very solid about what we're doing to harden our grids for climate change. But some of that will happen with the intelligence we need on the distribution grid to enable electrification and transportation and the potential beneficial electrification of gas. Those are the big buckets that I think we need to be continuing to think about. Brian, do you have anything.
Brian Van Abel : Yes, I would just add a couple more to that. One is in our 5-year plan, we have nothing on hydrogen whether if there's an opportunity on the electric side or potential looking opportunities on the gas LDC side as we work through our clean heat plans. Then also storage. We're working on some interesting long-duration storage projects and also with the stand-alone ITC on store -- for our storage we're looking at opportunities there. So I think there's a good number of, call it, incremental opportunities that aren't captured in our plan as we think through the overall benefits of the IRA.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's great to hear. And I just wanted to go into '23 guide a little bit more there. I think there's 1% growth next year instead of 2% this year. Just wondering, is this primarily post-COVID normalization or some, I guess, conservatism here? And just thoughts, I guess, on achieving flat O&M in 2023, including, I guess, work that you've done this year to derisk the 23 outlook, if you could kind of give us thoughts as to how that factors into the '23 guide?
Brian Van Abel : Yes. On the first part, just to make sure you're talking about sales, right?
Jeremy Tonet: Yes.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. Yes. So I think the way you framed it up, it's a little bit of both, right? It's a little post-COVID normalization. We expect to residential use for customer to come down kind of like we saw in Colorado this year where resi UPC has come down more towards pre-pandemic levels. And I think we expect to see that in other jurisdictions while we do see continued economic growth. So you could call it conservative. We are certainly conservative with our sales forecast this year going into the year, we thought we were going to be flat, and we've been up 2% and have seen strong economic activity.  On the O&M side, yes, I think as we went through this year, right, we're certainly subject to the inflationary pressures, and we have been flat since 2014 on O& M. So that was 8 years of being flat, and we had some inflationary pressures, had storms this year, increased investments in our customer platforms and also, we're running our coal plants much more given the change between gas prices and coal, so higher chemical costs, higher plant costs. So as we think about it next year, and we had a good year this year, if you look at kind of the change in the guidance from Q2 to Q3, we invested it this year, right, and when we have good time. So that's why we think about next year in maintaining flat almost a rebaselining into this year, doubling down our continuous improvement programs and setting ourselves up for next year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's all very helpful. One last one, if I could. If you might be able to speak on the  Colorado gas step increase denial there. Do you see this as a signal from the commission to continue regularly filing rate cases? And are there any takeaways on the electric side?
Bob Frenzel: I wouldn't have contagion, Jeremy, between the electric and the gas case. I think this year was particularly sensitive given the commodity increase in the impact of winter storm Yuri on the gas case. So no, I don't think I'd sort of read through too much to the electric side. We are continuing to invest in that system for safety and reliability and continued customer growth there. So we need to make sure that we're having the right balance of healthy financial metrics for the company. So we are going to file a rate case next year.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. And I just think about longer term on the gas LDC side, like our net 0 plans for 2030 and 2050 and the LDC side are aligned with the climate science, they're aligned with the state goals, and we're looking forward to working through the clean heat plant in Colorado. Really, I think about resource planning on the gas side. And I think that will help us align with the commission and our stakeholders on how we achieve these carbon reduction targets on the LDC side because it is a critical asset for us and our customers really see demand and interest in it.
Bob Frenzel: And just to put a time line on that, you should see a clean heat plan filing from the company sometime in the second half of next year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That all makes a lot of sense. Just checking.
Operator: And we will now take the next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.
Durgesh Chopra: Solid quarter here. Thank you time. Just I actually had 2 questions, Brian, for you. Just one, I think you mentioned this in your remarks, but the jump in CFO between the 2 plants the $1.8 billion or $2 billion is included in that CFO number, right, from the tax. 
Brian Van Abel : Correct.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. Then maybe just because it's a newer concept, how does that actually work? Is there a market for it? And how should we think about you monetizing those taxes? I heard Paul say that that's for newer assets, if I'm not wrong. So maybe just any color that you could give us there, which will sort of help us profile the cash flows through the 5 years?
Brian Van Abel : Yes, absolutely. And it's a great question because the market for PTCs and transferability doesn't exist because it's being stood up, and it's effective 1 -- so any credit generated starting January 1, 2023, so starting next year is eligible to be transferred. And we were instrumental in the language that was included. We worked very closely on that. So we've been very focused on this because it's so important for our customers to driving down the overall cost for renewables and the LCOE of projects. And for us, we spent a lot of time -- we're not waiting for a market to get set up, right? Longer term, I think a liquid exchange ultimately gets set up but we don't expect that in 2023. We've been going out ourselves talking to local companies that have a significant cash tax appetite to look at bilateral transactions. And I think there's a really good local angle here where we can save our customers' money. We've had very good reception in the discussions we've had. And so we feel very confident in being able to execute on this transferability. But even just being conservative, we've only assumed we transfer half of those credits in 2023, just in conservative nature. And that -- so it takes a little bit of while less set up in our financing plan. But from all the discussions we've had over the past month, we feel very bullish about being able to do this in the interest there from the other corporates.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Sounds like the process is already underway. And just to be clear, these are tax credits in excess of what you wouldn't be able to offset your taxes currently. Am I thinking about that correctly, Brian?
Brian Van Abel : Yes, you are. Yes.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Ross Flower with UBS.
Ross Fowler: So I just want to wind back a little bit to Nick's question on growth, right? You lowered the 22 base year to about 38.9%, which is lower than your previously forecasted growth and then your growing rate base out a little bit faster. If I look at your old forecast, it's sort of 6.4% to 6.5% through 25%, and now it's kind of 7.1% to 7.4% depending on the year through '25. And I know you mentioned transferability sort of brings that back a little bit. But now if I look at sort of your 3-year rate base growth out to 25%, it's about 7.3%, before it was sort of 6.5% or just under that. So it would seem to me that you're really pushing the high end of your EPS growth guidance here? Or am I not thinking about that correctly? And then I guess the second part of that question is the growth tails off a little bit in '26 and '27. Is that where you see most of that $2 billion to $4 billion in CapEx upside potential coming in?
Brian Van Abel : Yes. So I think, Ross, the way we think about it is really 5 to 7, we publicly target the upper half of that guidance range for EPS growth. And when we look at it, we feel very confident in delivering there. We've delivered in the upper half of our guidance for the past 12 years when you look at our annual earnings guidance and delivering on our guidance for 17 straight years. So we feel good about the plan we put in place. Yes, it's -- we have generally been known to put a conservative plan in place, and we have a lot of incremental upside. And I think you hit the nail on the head. If you look at 1 of our slides, we show where we think that incremental capital is going to be in the back half of the plan or the back 2 years of the plan. So I think that's the way to think about it as we kind of have that continued year-over-year strong rate base growth.
Ross Fowler: Okay. And maybe as we just look forward into winter, how are you thinking about natural gas fuel expenses there? Has any of that been sort of deferred through the regulatory process? Or how are you just thinking about build pressure generally? How do we keep that with customers because natural gas prices are up a lot year-over-year?
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Ross, it's Bob. We are certainly sensitive to the commodity impact on our natural gas customers in their bills this winter. We've been very active in energy efficiency programs. We've been very active in the federal and the state levels on identifying and trying to secure significant portions of LIHEAP funding and then working with our customers directly to find and enable those customers that may not even know they're LIHEAP eligible to benefit from some of the mechanisms that we have at the state and at the federal level to mitigate impacts on our customers. We start with some of the lowest rates in the country in our Colorado gas company but we recognize and are empathetic to everything is up from a starting point for customers who are feeling it at the pump, they're feeling it in rent and they're feeling it at the grocery store.  So we're empathetic. We're doing everything we can to mitigate the impacts. We have extended the cost of the winter storm Yuri costs in various jurisdictions anywhere from 2 to 5 years. So we have mitigated regulatory outcomes on that gas piece, but very active with our customers and communications as we go into the winter time.
Brian Van Abel : And I'll just add, Bob, you talked on the LDC side. We can touch on the electric side, right, we're 85% roughly electric. And we've really set ourselves up well with our Steel for Fuel investments, right? We've always viewed those as being a hedge against rising gas commodity costs, and that's exactly what we see. Now we're going to provide our customers over $1 billion in fuel-related benefits or avoidance this year alone with our owned wind farms and we got those approved back when their gas is $2 to $3 -- in the $2 to $3 range. So think about how economic those wind investments are for our customers now.  So on the electric side, we feel good about where we are. And also on the electric side, we have the third lowest bills of any investor-owned utility in the country. So we're at a really good starting point too. And so obviously, what Bob said, we're very conscientious of customer bill impacts, and I spent a lot of time focusing on how we can mitigate and manage those for our customers.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.
Steve Fleishman: So the 18% FFO to debt that you now see, I mean, that's obviously a great number, very strong, is that kind of your target now for FFO to debt going forward? Or how should we think about that?
Brian Van Abel : Steve, the way I think about it is a little bit of balance between FFO to debt and then the holding company debt to total debt. And that metric right now for Moody's has us at about a 25% threshold on that and certainly going to have a conversation about what that right threshold is. But -- great to see our FFO to debt with strong improvement of 100-plus basis points relative to pre IRA. So -- but we look at both of those in combination because it really is important to have -- maintain that strong credit quality, not only at the holding company, but also to work with our commissions ensure we have strong credit quality at all the operating companies too, because it really is in the best interest of the customer.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And just to clarify the comment that you made about the $2 billion to $4 billion incremental capital, I think you said you'd be able to finance it with the current capital structure. Could you just better clarify what that means? Does that mean you would finance it kind of consistent with the way your current capital structure is in terms of new debt and new equity or is it --
Brian Van Abel : It is consistent with the consolidated capital structure.
Bob Frenzel: Yes.
Steve Fleishman: So there would be more equity needed then to fund that if you --
Brian Van Abel : Yes, I'll caveat that with all depending on the timing of that capital. if it's more backdated, you maybe have more flexibility. So that's just sitting here today, but it really depends on the timing and we really evaluate it once we get more visibility on magnitude and timing of that capital.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Okay. Yes, because it just -- I mean I love strong balance sheet, just 18% is kind of off the charts these days. So it's -- but it's also obviously better to be strong than not.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. We said the IRA was good for us and good for our customers. So we're glad to be able to speak about it in more depth on this earnings call. We only had about 12 hours last Q2 earnings call to talk about it in [digested tax], so happy to spend more time on it now.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then another question, just on all the data that you gave on the IRA savings for the cost of solar and wind. So like Sherco 30% lower and some of the data. Just I want to just make sure I understand the starting point there because there have been a lot of inflationary pressures for like the last 18 months. And so when you're seeing these savings, are you going back to before that? Are you going to kind of where you'd be now, is the baseline including those inflationary cost pressures that had already occurred? I just want to make sure I understand the baseline for that -- for these.
Brian Van Abel : Absolutely. So Sherco -- I'll start with Sherco Solar. That includes from our initial -- very initial filing to the revised filing with higher capital costs to address the supply chain pressure. So that is -- includes all those pressures and then pre-IRA to post IRA. So that's that kind of actual capital costs, including pressures on the overall call it, panel pricing with everything --
Steve Fleishman: So the 30% -- so the 30% goes back to the initial filing or to the revised.
Brian Van Abel : The revised filing, so the revised filing, pre-IRA, post IRA. And then on the generics, assume capital cost is the same, assume today's capital cost or an inflated capital costs, right? So assume CapEx is the same. And a solar farm that would have qualified for a 10% ITC versus now you get a PTC for us, which is as a regulated utility, would choose the PTC. And then the range is based on NCFs if you qualify for any, call it, adders or bonuses, so just community energy.
Steve Fleishman: So those are savings, yes.
Brian Van Abel : Right. When that assumes say, a 2027 wind farm that would have qualified for 0 tax cut to 0 PTCs versus now 100% PTCs at the escalated value as you assume over time. So that's really where our customers are going to see when we add those several thousand megawatts or 5-plus thousand megawatts in that back half of the decade.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. That's great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.
Sophie Karp : I was curious if you could talk a little bit about this -- the collaboration with Bloom Energy on the zero-emission electrolyzer, I guess, produce hydrogen and try nuclear plants? Just curious if you could give any color on the milestones there. And also, can you describe why it makes sense to have this type of process at the nuclear plant, which is a base load plan and presumably could dispatch into the grade at all times as opposed to a wind facility that may have more variability.
Bob Frenzel: Sophie, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Look, we were a recipient of a high-temperature gas -- or high-temperature electrification pilot from the Department of Energy related to our Prairie Island nuclear plant. And the concept is -- and I think you hit on really the big point is, as we increase wind or renewable or 0 cost energy on our system, we see our nuclear plants, particularly in the shoulder months starting to cycle up and down. And we have processes and procedures and approvals to do that.  But your point is, wouldn't you rather keep the plant at 100% power and not cycle it. And that's exactly what the concept of an electrolyzer off the back of a nuclear plant does. As you take the steam, you let the reactor run at 100% power, but you don't run the generator at 100%, use that excess steam to do steam reformation on the electrolyzer, raise the temperature and create hydrogen that way. So you do it when the plant would otherwise be cycling that allows you reactor stability by keeping the nuclear plant at 100% power while keeping the generation plant load following on the electric side. And your comment on the manufacturers, we chose a manufacturer for the electrolyzer and I think that was your comment.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. And Sophie, I'll just add to it. We're working through the development of it, it should be online probably later in 2023. And as we think we -- this is a really interesting aspect of potentially how we could use our nuclear plants and create pink hydrogen. We're working with a consortium in our states around the hydrogen hub announcement and applying for a DOE grant. And so this is part of a broader opportunity as we think we work with our states, both in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest and also in Colorado and the surrounding states on another hydrogen hub.
Sophie Karp : I guess does it make a difference if it's the nuclear plant that you avoid cycling versus just hooking it up to a wind farm, I guess, from an operational standpoint, maybe it makes sense. But the marginal cost of the wind generation is 0, right, marginal cost of a nuclear plant is not 0. So economically, does that make a difference? Or since it’s on the same grade, it doesn't, like how should we think about this?
Brian Van Abel : And so this is 1 of the unique aspects of this, is high-temperature steam electrolysis. So we're taking waste steam off the nuclear plant to heat the water, which makes it 30% -- the electrolysis process 30% more efficient.
Operator: We will now take the next question from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Appreciate it. Listen, I want to just pick up real quickly around the $2 billion to $4 billion real quickly with respect to the upside CapEx. How do you think about that materializing just on a high level perspective? I know you flagged the back half of the year, but can you talk about some of the dynamics here in the near term that would result in that upside in the back half, i.e., is a lot of predicated on the Colorado RFP process this year. How do you think about that, you're manifesting itself here in just in terms of procurement processes? And related to that, what about the upside to this 50% renewable assumption that we've used in the past? You alluded to it in your script remarks on that front. It seems like there could be some latitude whether to have the repowerings or greenfield opportunity.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. Julien, let me hit on the first one. Yes, really two processes. One is the Minnesota RFP is already in flight. We launched it in -- later in Q3. And so that was a little bit of ahead of Colorado, so likely see a decision out of Minnesota in middle of '23 on the Minnesota, but that's a smaller RFP than Colorado. Colorado is the bigger RFP in terms of megawatts of renewables. And we'll look to launch that here later this year and then likely file the application with the Colorado Commission in, call it, mid to late Q3 is probably when you get some visibility into that and the decision, hopefully, by the end of next year on the Colorado Commission. So a little bit phased between Minnesota and Colorado.  On your question about the 50% assumption, we take a conservative assumption. And I think given the opportunity and the benefit that the IR has around the solar PTC and transferability, we expect to be extremely cost competitive and potentially have an opportunity to own more than 50%, and that's certainly our goal because we think it is long-term beneficial for our customers of ownership right? I mean the PPAs that were struck a few years ago aren't passing this benefit of transferability back to our customers as we are with our own wind farms. And we think about repowering our own wind farms longer term, it's more opportunity and benefit for our customers. So we think long-term ownership of these renewable assets is really good for our customers, and we're going to strive to tell as much as we possibly can.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And maybe let me just clarify a little bit. On the repowering side, are you thinking that that's pretty strictly going to be done through the RFP process here? And the time line and opportunities that sort of dictated through it or is there more of an opportunistic ability to approach customers on a one-off? I think you're implying the former.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. When you say repowerings, so I think about our own repowerings in the kind of the latter part of this decade, and that would not be in this RFP. That's a couple of years out type of opportunity to bring forth with our commissions in terms of we can do something that can save our customers' money. So I would say that's outside of the RFP process.
Bob Frenzel: But I would come back to the PPA buyout concept. And we think that RFPs and preferred plans as part of our resource plans are an opportunity to bring some of the PPA buyout toward, and we have talked about that. So we have a history of doing it outside of an RFP process as well as that being an emphasis and a driver for it. So I would expect that some of this stuff to come to fruition over the next 9 months to 12 months as we work through the process with our commissioners and with the RFP results.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. More of a holistic update, say, late next year, maybe by 4Q.
Bob Frenzel: Across -- all of the above. 
Operator: And we will now take the next question from Ryan Levine with Citigroup.
Ryan Levine: I just wanted to follow up on the hydrogen hub comments. To the extent that hydrogen hub is developed in your neighborhood or in your backyard, can you talk to the materiality for your business outlook in light of the IRA and your opportunities both on the gas and the electric side?
Bob Frenzel: Sure. This is Bob. Look, we're working on 2 applications for hydrogen hub. These proposals came out of the Infrastructure and Jobs Act that was passed around this time last year. The DOE is now in receptivity mode to receiving proposals. We've got 1 in the Upper Midwest, largely targeted around North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin, and we've got both the states and MOUs, partnerships as well as a lot of the energy providers in those states working collaboratively to identify all the facets of what a hydrogen hub could look like.  And I'll just give you the example in the Upper Midwest, we're looking at fertilizer production. We're looking at LDC gas. We're looking at gas for electric CTs, we're looking at hydrogen production off the back of our nuclear facilities, all encapsulated into a system that allows for transportation and storage and consumption of hydrogen that's produced from clean energy. Similarly, in the Western states, so in Colorado, we're working with a consortium of states, so Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico and Colorado on a similar concept out West. And again, a significant -- we and our Colorado companies at the center of those conversations, again, on electricity, hydrogen for electricity, hydrogen for our LDC system, hydrogen for agriculture, hydrogen for transportation.  So we talk about investment opportunities. I don't think we've characterized them fully in terms of the hub concept. The DOE has talked about the hubs being sort of $8 billion, 4 to 5 of them. So you could think about them being $1 million to $2 billion each. And each of those are requested to have sort of matching investments from private industry to match the public funds. And we've also characterized what a hydrogen production that would match just 5% of our LDC is somewhere between $2 billion to $4 billion of investments between the renewables it takes to generate it as well as the electrolyzer, the balance of plant and the storage and transportation, so significant investments to create hydrogen for the benefit of our customers and to enable our clean energy transition. So I'd say it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity largely centered in the back half of the decade.
Ryan Levine: And just to be clear, you have some disclosure in Minnesota around hydrogen-ready combined CTs. Is there any of that spending that's already in your plan? Or is this all incremental?
Bob Frenzel: As part of the Minnesota resource plan, we have reliability assets, combustion turbines that we've committed to making hydrogen capable that would be included in our plan, but that's just the CT side. But none of the production of hydrogen is included in our plan.
Operator: And we will now take the next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: You just answered my exact question on the hydrogen hub, so I won't repeat it. I appreciate all the detail there. Just 1 more in terms of the election, any key issues that you're looking at or key changes potentially in any of the state-level policies or legislatures?
Bob Frenzel: Travis, it's Bob. Thanks for the inquiry on hydrogen. Glad we can answer your question. On the election, I think we're about 10 days away, lots of activity on the television, lots of signs, lots of mailers, lots of e-mails and texts. We're obviously interested in outcomes. But I think as a company, we've been very successful working with all administrations. Our policies of energy transition, protecting our customers, enabling a good experience and having clean energy for all is really important. And I think we can work with any of our elected officials. We've got great relationships with those sitting officers today, and we look forward to continuing those into the future. But I don't see anything that's going to dramatically change our plans, our investment philosophy and our 10-year trajectory that we laid out today.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. I appreciate all the rest of the details on the call.
Operator: And there are no further questions. So I will turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel : Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks, and please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed.  This morning, we will review our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everybody. It was certainly an interesting 11th hour twist in legislative news last evening, but we'll get to that in just a minute. Let's start with our financial results. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share in 2022 compared with $0.58 per share in '21. Our earnings are on track with expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share.  During the quarter, we made good progress on our clean energy plan, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes. In June, the Colorado Commission approved our resource plan settlement, which includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of utility scale renewable additions. The conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas by the end of 2025, and the early retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit by the end of 2030, which will be the final coal plant retirement in Colorado.  We now have the approval of both our Minnesota and our Colorado resource plans, which together will add 10,000 megawatts of utility-scale renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. We anticipate issuing RFPs later this year, submitting our recommended portfolios by mid-2023 and receiving commission decisions in the second half of 2023.  We expect the recommended portfolio -- we expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers and power purchase agreements. Our plans are consistent with our steel for fuel strategy, which provides a valuable hedge for our customers against rising commodity prices. Our owned wind farms are projected to generate nearly $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone and a total of $2.7 billion since 2017.  We're excited about our transmission expansion opportunity. MISO's long-term planning approach identified projects in Futures 1 with an estimated investment of $30 billion that will be awarded in 4 discrete tranches. Earlier this week, the MISO board approved tranche 1, which includes $10 billion in projects. Based on the most recent information from MISO, we anticipate a $1.2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within tranche 1.  Turning to electric vehicles. We're making progress on our goal to power 1.5 million EVs by 2030, supporting our states in achieving their electrification goals. We are excited to be the first U.S. energy company to introduce all electric bucket trucks to our fleet, and we expect to file comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin in early August. These state proposals include single and multifamily residential offerings, commercial customer programs as well as a school bus pilot.  In addition, we're looking to accelerate EV adoption through the development of high-speed public charging infrastructure, a partnering with our states and other organizations. The proposed programs will also foster customer affordability, providing significant fuel savings for EV drivers and helping to keep bills affordable for all customers through load growth and enabling more efficient utilization of distribution grid infrastructure.  The Minnesota, Wisconsin proposals reflect capital investment of approximately $325 million from 2024 to 2026, which does not include distribution investments needed to upgrade the grid. Xcel Energy's clean energy leadership, including our long-standing track record of carbon reduction is a direct result of the passion that our dedicated employees bring to serve our customers and our communities.  Earlier this month, we received another exemplary rating from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operators for our Prairie Islan Nuclear Power Plant. We've continued to improve performance and cost efficiencies, demonstrating sustainable excellence in operations. I want to congratulate and thank all of our nuclear employees, support teams, contractors and suppliers for their commitment and impact. Nuclear remains a very important source of reliable carbon-free energy. We're proud to be 1 of the top operators in the nation.  Yesterday, it was announced that Senator Schumer and Manson had reached agreement on the inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While we still need to analyze the details to understand all of the nuances of the act, it appears to include nearly all the broader clean energy tax credits, including new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen storage and nuclear. While doesn't include direct pay for all taxpayers for all tax credits, it does include tax credit transferability as an option when direct pay is unavailable.  As we previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions included in the act would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. There's still a lot of twists and turns that can happen in Washington, but we're optimistic that the bill could become long.  This past quarter, we were honored to be among the first companies inducted into the Climate Leadership Hall of Fame, which recognizes different organizations across the country for exemplary leadership in response to climate change. We're also recognized with the Hubert H. Humphrey Public Leadership Award for our groundbreaking sustainability goals in Minnesota. And finally, we received the EEI National Key Accounts Award for outstanding customer engagement, which recognizes companies and their account executives for providing excellent support and offerings to corporate customers.  Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. And it's great to be recognized for our work and helping them achieve their goals. I want to thank these organizations for the recognition, along with our employees, partners and stakeholders who make it possible. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $0.58 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.25 per share, primarily driven by rises and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.15 per share, reflecting our capital investment program and the recognition of previously deferred costs related to the Texas electric rate case, higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. And other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.1% for the first 6 months of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. In addition, our unemployment rate is 80 basis points below the national average. As a result, we have revised our assumption for 2022 sales growth to 2%.  O&M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred expenses related to the Texas electric rate case, additional investments in technology and customer programs and increased costs for storms and vegetation management. Like other businesses, we are facing inflationary pressures and now expect an annual O&M increase of approximately 2%.  In addition to the Colorado resource plan approval, we also made strong progress on a number of other regulatory proceedings. The Colorado Commission approved our uristorm settlement, including full recovery of all costs with the exception of an $8 million isone primarily related to conservation messaging. In Minnesota, an ALJ recommended full recovery of all euro-related fuel costs. We anticipate a commission decision later this summer.  In Texas, the commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which provides a rate increase of $89 million. Rates were effective back to March 2021, which is why you see some year-to-date true-ups in revenue and various expense lines of the income statement. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. We have a pending natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a rate increase of approximately $175 million over 3 years, based on an ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 55.7%.  In June, intervener testimony was filed. The staff recommended an ROE of 9%, an equity ratio of 55% in a historic test year. While the UCA recommended a 9% ROE, an equity ratio of 51.5% in the historic test year. In July, we filed rebuttal testimony providing additional support for our file position. Hearings are scheduled for late August. We anticipate a commission decision later this year with final rates implemented in November of this year.  We recently filed our first electric rate case in South Dakota since 2014. We are seeking a $44 million revenue increase based on an ROE of 10.75% and equity ratio of 53% in the historic test year. We expect a decision in final rates implemented in the first quarter of 2023. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota. We are in the discovery phase and expect intervener testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release.  Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect the latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary.  The Colorado Commission approved our resource plan and Storm Urico recovery settlement. We received an ALJ recommendation in Minnesota for full recovery of fuel costs related to interest Storm Yuri. We will be filing our Midwest EV plan shortly. The Texas Commission approved our rate case settlement. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. All right. And our first question will come from Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse.
Nicholas Campanella: So I guess just -- thanks for the upfront color on the inflation Reduction Act, helpful. Just if there is an alternative minimum tax, can you just remind us how your business is positioned there?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Nick. Good morning. This is Brian. Yes, it's a good question. So we think about that book AMT is -- we look at it in a couple of different ways. First is we have credits available where you can offset 75% of that book AMT impact. And then also when we look at the transferability that's included in the legislation, that ultimately, when we put those 2 together, that we see this as cash flow accretive for us. Now I'll caveat that. This came out yesterday and the 700 pages of legislative text. So we're still working through it. But that's our view on the book AMT.
Nicholas Campanella: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on sales, this is like the second time, I think, this year that your electric sales forecast for the near year has changed to the positive. So just maybe kind of talk about what type of trends you're seeing for this year, how that kind of compares to your long-term forecast? And are you kind of starting to see structurally higher demand going forward? And is that a long-term tailwind for you?
Brian Van Abel: So that's a good question. And we've seen -- you're right, both in Q1 and Q2, we've increased our sales guidance for the year. And I would say there's probably some more opportunity there as we look into the balance of the year. Now certainly, the dependence on the macro impacts that could occur with what the Fed is doing, but we see strong C&I sales. And it's even better if you look at where Colorado is, the C&I sales in Colorado, that's -- this is an adjustment there when you normalize this large solar farm that we helped with a major customer behind the meter. C&I sales in Colorado are strong, too. So we're seeing that across our service territories with that C&I strength, good economic rebound.  We're seeing it on the residential side, we expected that, call it, reduction. And when we look at our budget, we're actually higher on residential than we expected. So structurally, I think we've seen a strong economy in the first half of the year and is certainly in the energy sector, in the manufacturing sector across the board. So as I think about longer term, obviously, you could have some potential headwinds if there's a recession or what happens and how big of an impact interest rates have. But I think we're bullish longer term when we start to think about the electrification opportunities, when we start to see EV penetration, when you start to see electrification of industrial processes. So I think there's a longer-term tailwind as I look at our service territories.  And just another example down in the Permian Basin. We've seen extremely strong growth. But longer term, we're talking to their customers about electrification. They have their own ESG goals and net zero goals in the Permian, and so we're in discussions of how you electrify pumps and rigs and compressors and ensuring that we have the capacity and the investments in our distribution and transmission system on there to serve them. So I think there are tailwinds longer term, and it's great to see the rebound that we have in the C&I sector.
Operator: All right. And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to dive into MISO a little bit here now that we have some more developments and touching on your $1.2 billion. Just wondering if you could characterize a bit more in terms of greenfield versus brownfield. And I guess this is just a preliminary estimate, but what's the scope, I guess, of what could possibly fall in incremental into this? Is this some competitive processes that still could make the way in? Just trying to feel our way through what this could mean.
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Good morning. This is Bob. Look, first of all, let me just comment on transmission broadly. We feel very confident and excited about the transmission build-out opportunities we have. And as you think about where we've been this past quarter between the Colorado power pathway, the transmission needs from the Minnesota Resource Plan, and now the MISO MTEP tranche that's about $3.5 billion of large-scale transmission projects that we've identified and, in some cases, have approved.  So the class is important to us. It's certainly going to enable our ability to add to 10,000 megawatts of renewables that we need from the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans, and to continue to execute on our 20%, 30%, 80% carbon reduction vision. Particularly with regard to the MISO MTEP process, I think we put our best estimate out in terms of the investment opportunity around $1.5 billion for about 6 different -- portions of 6 different projects. We've got ROFR legislation in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and feel pretty confident about what we've put forward in terms of the opportunity in MTEP.
Brian Van Abel: And Jeremy, I'd just add to that, like Bob said, we feel good about our point estimate and the Wisconsin projects were deemed upgrades, so they're not expected to be competitively bid. So what you see as we put in our earnings presentation, are what we expect to be ours and owned, and that's our good estimate right now.
Paul Johnson: And the estimate does not include any competitive bid. So if we choose to be competitively bid and we're successful, that would be incremental to the $1.2 billion.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. So this $1.2 billion replaces the 1 to 2 range, but there's still potentially competitive processes that could add to this is a fair way to think about it?
Paul Johnson: Yes.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And thanks for all the comments on the climate policy so far and noting that this is hot off the press. But just wondering if there's any particular items in there, if we peel back the onion more, what do you see as the largest potential impact and points of opportunity to your plan near and long term? I mean, could CCS be something that's thought about more now?
Robert Frenzel: It's great question. Again, as Brian said, you kind of have to absorb about a page a minute since it came out last night to get through all the text. But we've been talking about a lot of these broad strokes since the third quarter call and EEI Financial Conference last fall. Some really interesting things in here is we've seen production increases in solar, the PTC for solar is really interesting relative to an ITC. You might see some regional differentiations on people using PTCs versus ITCs. I think the transferability piece is really interesting as we think about not just for our account, but for everybody who builds renewable assets and the friction costs that are embedded. We're financing some of those things, particularly with tax equity.  This could overall bring the cost of both owned and PPA assets down, again, real benefits for our customers as we continue to make this transition. Stand-alone storage credit is interesting. There's some really challenges with the pairing of solar and storage. We've made them work, but this makes stand-alone storage pretty interesting. And then Obviously, our North Dakota company is -- the governor there has put a very aggressive carbon neutral goal on the table and CCS is really important to North Dakota. So I think as we look across the country and across our portfolio, you're going to find bits and pieces of all of this to be interesting.  And notwithstanding all of that, there's great stuff around energy security, electric vehicles and resiliency all built into this that we really haven't even dug into. But I think it's a terrific piece of legislation for us as a company, and we're excited to dig in and hopefully see this pass the House and the Senate before the end of the fiscal year.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I'll just add to that, Bob. I mean, as we're in the middle of developing our clean heat plans for our gas LDCs in Colorado and Minnesota and have a hydrogen PTC. So you couple that with a long-term PTC for wind or solar, it really gives -- should give green hydrogen a jump start. And so we're excited about that. And so I think there's a number of great things in this bill. And ultimately, we look at it, it's really in the looks and feel similar to what I talked about on Q3 of last year in terms of the impacts to us.  But ultimately, we look as cash flow accretive and slightly, there's some slight rate base reductions from we become more tax efficient, but slightly EPS beneficial. Now again, that's with a caveat, we're digging into it and make sure we understand everything, particularly around transferability but when we look at this whole package, as we talked about, our current plan is not built on this, right? Our current 5-year plan and long-term plan, our research plans were approved with current tax law. This just makes our plans even better for our customers. And that's the important point long run. Great for our customers as we make this clean energy transition even more affordable. So we're excited about this and optimistic that it gets passed.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's super helpful. If I could just circle back to MISO. Real quick, real quick last 1 here. Of the $10.3 billion of capital there, do you -- would you be willing to share any thoughts on how much of that you think could go through a competitive process?
Paul Johnson: I think the estimates I've seen are about $1 billion.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time and the opportunity to connect here. Really appreciate it. So I'm going to keep going on this on the same front. Let's talk a little bit more on the legislative, how does your prior [indiscernible] debt improvement target under BBB with direct [indiscernible] compare to your first take of the provisions under the IRA factoring in the transferability elements, right? You specifically called that out a moment ago in your prepared remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Julien. Good morning. And like I said, it was -- and Bob said it is hot off the press and 700 pages of legislative text, so making sure we understand it in our nuances. So there's absolutely caveats as we think about it. But I think the best way to think about it, if you remember what we talked about in Q3 is maybe 75 to 100 basis points or higher improvement in FFO to that CFO to debt as we look at it, which gives us financing flexibility down the road potential capital headroom. But again, there's a lot to unpack around transferability and how that would ultimately work. But ultimately, our initial take is a little bit in line with what we talked about in Q3. So really good for us, but ultimately great for our customers as we think about how we can make this clean energy transition even more affordable for our customers.
Paul Johnson: It also be noted that Brian didn't go to bed last night. So he's doing all the math on this. So take that with a grain of salt.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, totally. In his delirium though, nonetheless, you're broadly affirming your expectation that the math is not too different from the -- what you described in the third quarter? Correct?
Paul Johnson: With the caveat that we're still understanding. understanding.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally, completely. With that asteric, but also, what does that do for your equity needs, right? Let's just take that a step further if we can start to unpack that.
Brian Van Abel: Look, so we talked about it gives us more flexibility. I think how we're going to unpack all this is we're rolling forward our capital plans and we'll release those in Q3 in our October earnings release. We'll know whether or not this passes by then. We should know a lot sooner whether this passes or not, and we can provide you a full update because that will include updated capital plans and how we're going to finance that so. But it certainly does give us more financing flexibility.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. All right. And then a super quick last 1 here. I know on transmission, we talked a bit already. What about the ROFR challenges at FERC? Again, I know that's more recent here, but -- any thoughts perspective on the FERC angle here? Again, I guess this is states versus FERC and then also time frame?
Robert Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob. I think these have been challenged in both state and federal court and the ROFRs have held up, and we expect them to.
Operator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.
Insoo Kim: My first one, just regarding the inflation impact in the O&M and the higher financing costs there. Like as we look I guess, beyond '22 into '23 and you just try to get ahead of it, what are some options you have that you could do now on any levers, I guess, to get ahead and position for '23?
Brian Van Abel: Certainly, we're continually looking to offset inflationary pressures, and this is no different than any other year. But we've had O&M flat since 2014, and we're very proud of that because it has a direct impact on customer bills. Now like everyone else, we're feeling the inflationary pressures this year and adjusted our O&M up by 5% but as we go through the year and see how the year unfolds, you certainly take actions to see if you can set up next year in terms of how it's looking.  And we have a continuous improvement team that is regularly working with our business areas. We're investing in technology this year, what we have something called the digital operations factory that helps drive technology into the business areas to reduce O&M costs and make us more efficient. So that's just part of our DNA and part of our culture that we've stood up, and you can see in how we've managed on over the long term. So that's really our focus in terms of what we see now. We do expect some inflationary pressures to continue through the balance of the year, and that's a bit why we increased our guidance. But I think you should expect more of the same as, right? We're going to deliver for our customers. We're going to deliver operationally, and we'll deliver financially this year and in the future.
Insoo Kim: Got it. My second one, and I think I know the answer to this one, but just given what could be on the table here on the legislative front for nuclear, does that change your thoughts on, I guess, over the next 5- to 10-year plan on building more, maybe it's a small module in nuclear or others?
Robert Frenzel: Hey Insoo, it's Bob. Look, I think the legislation as it starts is really beneficial for the existing nuclear owners and in our case, the customers who would receive any benefits from production tax credits associated with the existing nuclear embedded within the new legislation. I think longer term, we've been pretty stalwart in saying that we, as a country, need to identify new clean energy resources that can be dispatchable and carbon-free to enable the transition to a carbon-light economy or a carbon-neutral economy.  And I think new nuclear has to play a role in that. I don't think it's a this decade role, certainly not for Xcel Energy but we are active at any eye. We are active in the development process. We've been working diligently with new scale as they've been trying to stand up there and get permission to build their first new nuclear reactor. So we're -- we watch very closely. We're engaged in the dialogue. I think it's next decade or beyond issue and opportunity for us as a company.
Insoo Kim: Got it. That's what I expected.
Operator: All right. Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: I had a quick question on the color pathway and the potential upside opportunity there. Is that something that could crystallize basically after you get the RSPs done and you get a sense of where the projects are coming into place there that we get a sense of whether that could be added to the plan at some point in 2023?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. David, yes, you're exactly right. Once we kind of see where these projects are located and call it the mix of projects, we'll be able to come out at the same time with what we expect to call the network upgrades voltage support that we need. And also the commission did conditionally approve that, call it, that lag that $250 million lag basically a radial and we fully expect projects to show up there, too. So we'll be able to give color both on the, call it, our renewable opportunity at that point in time, plus the incremental transmission investments we expect to make which will be probably -- if we play this out probably middle of next year once we see that final portfolio.
David Arcaro: Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And on the Minnesota rate case, I was wondering, when does the window kind of open for a potential settlement? And any thoughts on prospects of settlement given the focus areas and what you've proposed here?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Thanks, David. It's Bob. Look, the cases are progressing through the regulatory process. I think when I look at the cases, they reflect a lot of the investment categories and alignment with our policy and stakeholders. So we don't expect any contentious issues there. Typically, we don't start talking settlement with counterparties until after their testimony has been received. So on the gas case that's expected at the end of August and in the electric case, that's early October. So probably more ripe for discussions in late Q3 or into Q4.
David Arcaro: Okay. Great. Sounds good. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.
Sophie Karp: If I may follow up on the MISO tranche 1, how much of the 1.2 is sort of low-hanging foot here where you have right of ways and basically shovel-ready, if you will? And then the same question for your competitive opportunities in that could potentially come behind it.
Robert Frenzel: Yes. So look, I think we're in early innings in terms of the development of those lines. I think that some of them are concluded into existing substations, but most of the lines themselves are going to be greenfield and require local siting and permitting processes. I think that this is an area of strength and execution for the company as we do this. We did the CapEx 2020 plans up in the upper Midwest, we did the MVP plans. And so we've got a really strong team and a good partnership with the Grid North Partners Group that we think that from an execution perspective, this is something that's right in our wheelhouse.
Brian Van Abel: And I'll just add, Sophie, is we'll go through the regulatory processes, certificate of need processes with our commissions. And so that will take 1 year, 1.5 years to get through those processes where we'll determine final work on final routing and permitting, everything.
Sophie Karp: Right, right. And so is that -- how much of that is already baked into your long-term capital plan, if anything, can you remind us?
Brian Van Abel: So we had some -- a little bit in our 5-year plan. But when we look at it, right, these in service states are expected to be called by 2030. So we'll start -- you'll start to see as we roll forward our 5-year plan is that spend will kind of be baked in that new 5-year plan that we roll forward is how you'll see it in October. And we'll include it in our 10-year plan as we bring -- roll forward our 10-year plan to.
Paul Johnson: We did have some of it captured in the second 5 years of our...
Sophie Karp: Another question I had is on the ROEs, right? So kind of in the 9s and low 9s across the board in your territories. Interest rates keep going up, ROEs are kind of sticky at this level. And I can appreciate the fact that they were sticking on the way down, too, right? But with the rates being higher and arguments being made that the structure would be higher in the next decade. Do you see this trend kind of reverse a little bit and maybe they are a picking up? Or is that pretty much not something that we should look forward to?
Brian Van Abel: Sophie, that's a good question. I think the way we look at it, we kind of look at some recent data points, and there's a couple of data points in Minnesota. One was an ROE decision late last year for Otter Tail at 9.48%. And then there's a -- and we have a 906 Minnesota electric business right now. And then in the gas side, CenterPoint has a settlement pending in Minnesota with a 939 and Armin's gas, ROE is a 904. So no, I think as we see inflationary pressures, interest rates go up that they were sticky to go down, but I think we do have below the national average authorized ROEs across most of our jurisdictions, and we'd like to work to get those closer to the national average. We do think we are a very good operator. We are a policy aligned with our commissions, policy aligns with our states in terms of helping them achieve their decarbonization goals. And hopefully, it can be reflective in some of the outcomes we see in the future.
Operator: And next, we'll take a question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: So just -- I know like I can completely relate to the 700 pages late-night experience. But you mentioned how affordability could be potentially beneficial from the bill. Do you have any sense as to what the potential rate impact might be from the bill?
Brian Van Abel: So this is a longer term when we look at it, and this is some of the analysis, we haven't done a very long-term model. We modeled it a while ago when we were looking at the earlier provisions. We saw about a 1% benefit to our customers over the long term on a CAGR basis as we thought about. Now there's a lot of caveats there in terms of what type of renewable deployment we have. But we are looking at inflationary right? Our target is long-term customer bill impacts at inflation, and this helped us drive below that.  So I think that's kind of the magnitude. Now certainly will depend on the nuclear PTC and some of the nuances in terms of hydrogen. But I think longer term, we see a significant benefit to that. And I would just add that we're really well positioned for this type of long-term credit extension because I don't believe there's an IOU that has a better combination of wind and solar in our backyard than we do. And so our commissions approved our plans without any extension of tax credits. Now to have this on top of it just puts us in a really good position to deliver on this community transition for our customers even more affordably.  And no, our view is long term customer bills matter. And for us to make this transition more affordably for our customers is great, and we look forward to working through with our commissions.
Robert Frenzel: Yes, I'll just add on to what Brian said, and I agree with him completely. I think the opportunity here is really interesting because if we can make the energy transition more cost effective, that becomes an economic driver engine. Businesses are attracted to places that have clean energy and low-cost clean energy and reliable clean energy. When I think about a transition to clean fuels and green hydrogen with the production capability that we have and the wind and the solar resources we've got in and adjacent to our footprint should make the production of clean fuels more cost effective in the middle of the country, in the Midwest and in the Southwest than other parts.  And you've seen that as we've located wind and solar across the country, they've been concentrated in those areas. And we'd expect those continued economic development drivers to drive our business long term.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And then just to clarify, going to talk about 1%. That's on a CAGR basis. So as you accumulate that over time, it becomes very significant for our customers. So like I said, optimistic this gets passed, but our plans are not built on it. But if it does, we look forward to driving forward our plans even faster.
Paul Patterson: Awesome. And then there was a local article about curtailments of wind production in Southern Minnesota. And I know you guys are pretty well positioned and what have you. But you guys are at a very large footprint, and you guys are very familiar with the situation around you. Do you see any -- well, are there any issues potentially that you're seeing? But also more significantly, perhaps, are there any situations that you're seeing with specific wind farms and curtailment occurring with other parties in your jurisdiction. I mean, the story sounds pretty significant in terms of how some counties were being impacted from a tax revenue perspective in the southern part of Minnesota. So I just was wondering if you had any insight on that?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think that we have seen curtailment in Southwestern Minnesota. It was a source of a significant amount of wind build-out over the last decade for us and for the region. And so 1 of the great things about the MTAP program is that it's identifying the need and locating transmission resources to move that 0 cost resource to the load. In the short term, it's led to curtailment and congestion. In the longer term, we think that frees up and is able to get to the load and deliver.  I don't think that it's concentrated in any 1 entity in terms of the owners of the farms, but I think it's out there. And as we think about the impact for our customers, some of that's just is driven by the desire and the need for clean energy curtailments built into a lot of our plans, and we recognize that sometimes that has implications for local communities on property taxes or wind production payments. But I think it's certainly manageable and something we're in conversations with our stakeholders as well.
Operator: We have no additional questions. I'll turn the call back to CFO, Brian Van Abel for closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: And this does conclude today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we'll review our 2022 results, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. In addition today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. At Xcel, we had another strong quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for 2022 compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. And as a result, we're reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. During the quarter, we made strong progress on our clean energy plan, achieving significant and constructive regulatory outcomes. In February, the Minnesota Commission approved our resource plan, which achieved an 85% carbon reduction in a full coal exit by 2030. Other key components include an early retirement of the King coal plant in 2028 in the Sherco Unit 3 in 2030. 10 year extension of our Monticello nuclear facility, in the addition of approximately 6,000 megawatts of new wind and solar resources. The ownership of 2 new generation time lines associated with the retiring coal plants as well as the associated 2,600 megawatts of renewable resources on those lines. And finally, the commission recognized the need for approximately 800 megawatts of firm dispatchable resources, which will go through a separate certificate of need process. As you can tell that based on the latest MISO capacity auction results, it's critical that we add these firm dispatchable resources to ensure the reliability and affordability of the transition for our customers. Shifting to Colorado earlier this week, we reached a revised settlement on our electric resource plan. As a result, additional parties joined that settlement. The revised agreement further accelerates the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to no later than January 1, 2031, which we believe addresses the concerns expressed by the commission during previous deliberations, settlement includes approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewable additions and the conversion of our Pawnee coal plant to natural gas no later than January 1, 2026. This resource plan is expected to reduce carbon by at least 85% by 2030. We believe the revised settlement will enable the commission to rule on the resource plan in June. Together, our Minnesota and Colorado Resource Plan will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This is consistent with our steel-for-fuel strategy which provides a significant hedge against rising commodity prices and is projected to generate over $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 alone. In terms of next steps, we anticipate issuing RFPs in the second half of this year with insight into the preferred portfolio early next year and commission decisions in the first half of 2023. We expect the recommended portfolio of generation assets will include self-build, build-own transfers as well as some power purchase agreements. This time line represents a modest delay in our original plans, but provides additional time for more clarity given the solar supply chain considerations. Last quarter, the Colorado Commission approved our $1.7 billion Pathway transmission project to enable access to 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in some of the richest wind and solar resources in the region. The commission also conditionally approved the 90-mile May Valley to Longhorn line extension with an additional investment opportunity of approximately $250 million. These constructive regulatory outcomes reflect our alignment with our commissions on our clean energy transition, which is critical as we work to deliver reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to the states, the communities and the customers that we serve. We also remain excited about the transmission expansion opportunities in our Midwest region. MISO's Future 1 scenario, which reflects an estimated $30 billion of investment opportunities expected to be awarded in four discrete tranches. Tranche 1 includes roughly $10 billion of projects and MISO decision on that tranche is anticipated this July. Our preliminary estimates suggest a $1 billion to $2 billion investment opportunity for Xcel Energy within Tranche 1, and we expect to have more clarity this summer after MISO provides more detail on the recommended portfolio. Longer-term, we expect to be awarded approximately $5 billion to $6 billion in total Future 1 investments. And as we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the Build Back Better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable our clean energy transition while keeping our customer bills affordable. While that legislation has stalled, there is ongoing discussion of a more modest version potentially moving forward this year. We would expect it to include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and even transmission along with a direct pay option for those tax credits. We continue to work with our federal delegation as well as the EEI to advocate for these provisions, which we believe would benefit our customers and accelerate a clean energy transition nationally. Shifting to electric vehicles. We are executing well on our approved Colorado and New Mexico plans, and we recently received approval of our transportation plan in Minnesota, which outline future program focus areas and allows for implementation of new, fast chargers in our service territory in Minnesota. We're also supporting comprehensive transportation legislation in Minnesota that includes the potential for customer rebates similar to what we're implementing in Colorado. We're planning a more substantial update around these programs this summer to coincide with potential federal funding from the IIJA, and these are important steps in helping drive electric vehicle adoption as we support the goals of our states. Given strong alignment with our states on EV goals and our progress to date, we continue to anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and load growth from electric vehicles. We've made significant progress this quarter, and I'm proud of the way our teams delivered those results. Our regulatory settlements and outcomes reflect our diligent efforts to listen, engage and collaborate with our many stakeholders, not just through regulatory processes, but also through our sustainability priorities and our core values. We have a history of strong storm restoration, and earlier this month had another opportunity to showcase our operational excellence when we experienced two feet of snow in North Dakota. Our teams were prepared and restore power to customers quickly despite battling frigid conditions. Our system resilience and storm preparatives are great examples of our continued discipline and proactive planning, strong execution and our employees' commitment to customer service. We strive to deliver our company values every day. And as a result, we were again named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. And the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We're also recognized by Military Times and GI Jobs for our continued commitment to veteran hiring. And finally, I want to pause and remember that today, April 28 is Workers' Memorial Day, which for more than 50 years has been a day of remembrance for workers who've been injured or killed in the line of work. I want to acknowledge that all the women and men of Xcel Energy, our contractor partners and all utility workers across the country sacrifice to provide the critical energy needs of our customers and our communities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter, recording earnings of $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2022 and compared with $0.67 per share in 2021. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.12 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.05 per share. But keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting our capital investment program; higher O&M expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.02 per share; and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 3.9% for the first quarter of 2022, largely due to higher C&I sales driven by improved economic activity as COVID impacts lessen. Our unemployment rate is 60 basis points below the national average, and our economies are growing faster than the average of the country. As a result, we've increased our 2022 electric sales growth assumption of 1% to 2%. Our O&M expenses increased $18 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher insurance costs and additional investments in technology and our customer programs. We now project an annual O&M increase of approximately 1%. While Bob touched on the resource plan and transmission regulatory approvals this past quarter, we also made strong progress on various rate cases. In March, the Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3% and an equity ratio of 55.7%. New rates were effective in April. In February, New Mexico Commission approved our electric rate case settlement, which will provide a net rate increase of $62 million and includes an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7% for determining the revenue requirements for our wind projects. Rates were effective at the end of February. Now every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel these are constructive outcomes for all parties. We also have pending rate cases in all the jurisdictions. In Texas, we have a Blackbox settlement in our electric rate case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. We also have pending electric and natural gas rate cases in Minnesota and are early in the process. We're in the discovery phase and expecting intervenor testimony this fall, followed by commission decisions in 2023. In addition, we'll look for opportunities to resettlements on both these cases after intervenor testimony has been filed. Earlier this year, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, the request is driven by significant capital investment to support continued customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Details on these cases and schedules are included in our earnings release. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions to reflect our latest information. Details are included in our earnings release. Please note, our depreciation expense assumption has increased to reflect regulatory recovery in Colorado and New Mexico. In addition, the decreasing capital riders in the lower ETR reflect an IRS increase in the value of the PTC. These assumption changes are largely earnings neutral. Finally, the combination of increased sales growth, favorable weather and lower O&M costs are expected to mitigate the headwind associated with replacement power costs related to Comanche 3 and increased interest expense due to rising rates. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. The Minnesota Commission approved our research plan. The Colorado Commission approved our electric rate case settlement and Pathway transmission project. We reached a revised settlement on the Colorado Resource Plan, which has the support of additional parties and accelerated retirement of Comanche 3 to no later than January 1, 2031. We are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance. And we remain confident, we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Robert Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy. How are you? Busy day for you.
Jeremy Tonet: That's right. Thanks. I just want to start off on the solar supply chain. You noted in the release some timing changes there. And just wondering if you could speak to your conversations with developers in the supply chain. And any thoughts you could share or any consensus or hearing out there with regards to resolution of the DOC's anti-circumvention investigation? Or just any thoughts on that topic in general at this point?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Jeremy, good morning. We are certainly seeing the disruptions and given you saw the impacts in our earnings release and all the impacts it's had on the panel supply. No, we're in regular contact with developers, whether it's on BOT projects or PPAs that are going to work. So even as we think about we're going into potential RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado later this year. Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a consensus. I think there's a good argument for it, not to be affirmed in terms of a tariff, but we'll wait and see where the Department of Commerce rules on it. Certainly, right, it'll be the preliminary finding at the end of August will be the first real data point and then we'll see how things go from there. For us, I think we're in a good spot. Solar CapEx is less than 3% of our overall five year CapEx plan. And we have flexibility to delay our projects, the Sherco Solar Project in the Western Mustang. So we really just pushed them later into our five year plan. I just want to note that we are very committed to those projects, both the Sherco Solar and Western Mustang. Well, Sherco Solar is going to be the largest solar farm in Minnesota. We're pretty excited about it. We can reuse a coal transmission interconnection. It reinvest tax base into that community and also able to create good local paying union construction jobs. So we are very committed to that and look forward to working with our intervenors and our stakeholders and the commission as we bring forward a new plan on that. But really, we just asked for some time, as you said, to work through kind of what the real supply chain impacts are here. I think broader -- or on a broader note, I think this really points to the importance of getting a domestic clean energy supply chain. And hopefully, with this event and some of the other global events that are happening as we can get some legislation passed in Washington, as Bob noted, there's a lot of incentives for clean energy manufacturing, and we're very supportive of that and then also very supportive on the tax credit side for production of wind, solar, hydrogen. I think that will be absolutely great for our customers long-term. So we certainly weighing in where we can on this issue.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then maybe just pivoting towards Colorado in the IRP revised settlement filed in April. With the implications for the 2031 Comanche Unit 3 retirement there, just wondering how you think about, I guess, potential generation replacement options going forward at this point? Or just any other details on that you could provide?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Jeremy, it's Bob. We said that we've got about 4,000 megawatts of new renewables as part of this resource plan. As it pertains specifically to Comanche 3 replacement, we're going to need a separate regulatory proceeding to address the capacity replacement and the energy replacement of that unit, and we expect that to be maybe two to three years from now.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And then maybe just a quick last one on MISO, the $1 billion to $2 billion of CapEx for Tranche 1 that you identified today. Just wondering how that, I guess, squares versus your expectations? Have they been kind of changing over time based on what you're seeing unfolding here? And just any other thoughts, I guess, for two and three sizing up what those investment opportunities might look like for Xcel?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Look, we see great opportunity and great need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest and is one of the largest transmission owners in the country. Our expectations for Future 1 and Tranche 1 really haven't changed. That's still a bit of our same range one to two in Tranche 1, and five to six over Future 1. And then if you think about longer-term in the country nationally, when you look at MISO's Future 3, that looks a little bit more like what would match something that has the decarbonization plans of the United States embedded into it. So we see great opportunity here. Only thing that's changed in our view was a little bit of a delay in the timing of the MISO publishing the results and then getting Board approval for the plans. But our investment opportunity looks very similar.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, that is all very helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thanks for the time.
Robert Frenzel: Hey, good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So perhaps just the nuance here on Comanche 3, just if you can speak to it, just the extent to which the plant is out in kind of near-term purchase power impact. I imagine that that's fairly transparent. I just want to check in on that. And then also, related on C3, just any efforts to improve the reliability of the unit through the 2031 time frame?
Robert Frenzel: Sure. Happy to chat about it. Look, Unit 3 went down in January. In our fourth quarter call, we indicated that it was likely going to be a two months repair. After inspection and discovery, it looks more like a four month repair and our cost looks more like $25 million as opposed to the $9 million or $10 million we talked about in the first quarter. I feel comfortable with that in that the collector rings on the generator, which is what we needed to repair, were sourced, have been procured and have been delivered to the United States, and we're starting reassembly as early as this week. So our June time frame, I feel pretty comfortable about. We did have higher purchase power costs to replace that unit, and that's reflective of the $25 million estimate that we put out there. And look, longer term, the reliability of that unit, I think early in its life, it had some asset challenges, and they're largely behind us. And I think we've spent a lot of time on operational excellence at -- in our generation fleet broadly and in Colorado, in particular. And I think we should have sustained reliability in that unit for the balance of the decade.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then just if I can pivot here in terms of the buy-ins as you previously talked about, obviously, some of your peers have as well. I mean, how is that going, the process negotiations been, wind cost increases, is that an issue here for the relative economics? Or is pressure on that vertical, keeping the economics close to intact here, just to kind of revisit the wind subject, especially in light of everything.
Brian Van Abel: Julien, just to clarify, when you say buy-ins, you mean PPA buyout opportunities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Sorry. Indeed.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, different nomenclature of different companies. The way we've talked about it recently, like we still see a good opportunity. But I think for us, the next opportunity comes through the RFPs that we're issuing after we resolve the -- Minnesota resolved the ERP, and we're waiting on the Colorado commission to approve our revised ERP settlement. So I think that's the process for us in the near-term in terms of seeing some potential PPA buyout opportunities as it will get bid into an RFP and we have a nice process set up so we don't have to work outside of that. I think -- so as I think about it longer term with where gas prices are today and call the upward step change in long-term gas forecast as I think it provides us more opportunity on wind. Even if you see higher capital cost for wind pushed up by inflation or on the solar side, right? That comparison against gas being kind of the marginal fuel, the offset fuel is -- will make the renewable strategy and buyout opportunities more valuable for our customers and we have to demonstrate customer benefit. And then the other data point to watch and we've spoken about it before is an extension of the long-term extension of PTCs just provides a longer run rate for us to look at buying something else, repowering them because we've been very successful at our recent buyouts that have been buyout and repower. So that's a little bit of commentary before. But I think when you think about inflationary costs on renewables relative to how we look at it for customer benefit and what the fuels you offset is I think they'll still hunt.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Certainly, I'm just curious on the timing. It sounds like that's not necessarily as relatively pressing as something to the RFPs. That's what you've...
Brian Van Abel: Yes. No, I think it's more about the commission when there's a process upcoming like an RFP. The commission -- it makes sense for us to follow that RFP and have that process already laid out versus doing a separate one-off regulatory approval.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, okay. Excellent. I will leave at there. Thank you guys.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thank you for taking my questions. Brian, just one quick one for me. The -- looking at the 2020 earnings guidance reaffirmation and changes, the depreciation expense increase, that is the -- is that -- I know it says regulatory recovery here. Is that a depreciation expense change that to whatever studies that you were able to get? Or what does that actually represent?
Brian Van Abel: It's really the implementation of new rates with the rate cases in Colorado and New Mexico. And so that will be offset by the revenue with it. So it's really earnings neutral and just the implementation of new rates. That comes out of the rate case.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Is that cash flow accretive? Are you -- I mean, is it higher rates? Or I'm just -- are these new...
Brian Van Abel: Yes.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay. So this would be cash flow positive modestly, I guess?
Brian Van Abel: Yes.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller: There's been a lot of talk obviously about solar and supply chain. I'm wondering you touched on this a little bit, but I wanted some more comments on, could you see a shift toward wins in the near term, especially the RFPs, would you anticipate maybe seeing a little solar pullback, at least again, in the near term, a little more wins? And are there supply chain issues that might prevent that on the wind side?
Brian Van Abel: Travis, it's a good question. One of the reasons why, at least in Minnesota, we've slowed down the RFP is to see if we can get some visibility into the preliminary finding for the tariff investigation. And so I think that will help. But these are longer term. We're looking to source renewable projects, '25 and beyond. So I think it's a fair question, and you certainly could see some shift from solar to wind maybe in the near term. But ultimately, the way we look at it long term, we are adding a lot. We do need a lot of solar and wind, we need that resource diversity from wind and solar. And so it's not just purely a cost perspective. It's what is called the capacity accreditation for solar. So there's a little bit more nuance going into it, even if you do see some changes in overall capital costs.
Robert Frenzel: Yes. So Travis, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Brian said. When you think about our renewable mix right now, we're about 11 gigs of wind and two gigs of solar, if you count community and rooftop in that number. As we look forward, the 10,000 megawatts that we're likely to add over the next decade is probably 60-40 wind solar, but that's for us, and it's indicative of our needs and where we -- what our starting point is. You asked a good question about nationally, could you see a shift towards wind in lieu of solar. I think it's going to be company dependent, but you do raise a nice thoughtful point around the wind supply chain looks a little bit more certain right now than the solar supply chain. But again, we expect the DOC outcome sometime in August, and we're hopeful to not have a significant tariff there for the benefit of our customers. And in the meantime, just the fact that we've got still working hard on federal legislation for tax credits recognizing that with inflationary pressures on both, all these will be mitigants for clean energy transition across the country.
Travis Miller: Great. I appreciate all that detail. And then just one other quick thing. When might we see some of these transmission projects and proposals start flowing through your CapEx plan? Just a year away, two years away, are you months away?
Brian Van Abel: So Travis, we expect approval in, call it, the summer time frame, MISO July time frame. And then certainly, we would need to go through a certificate of need process with our commissions. But right now, we don't have any of that MISO capital that in, call it, Tranche 1 in our five year plan. So could you start to see it in the '25-'26 time frame? Certainly, potentially. And we'll give you more visibility into that as we get some ourselves with the approval of MISO and then we start the regulatory proceedings at the state level.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Campanella: Hey everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here and taking my questions.
Brian Van Abel: It is pleasure, Nick.
Nicholas Campanella: Yes, thank you. I heard your prepared remarks on just the MISO capacity print. Can you just kind of update us on how Xcel is exposed to these higher capacity prices on the supply side here? Just kind of saw some of your MISO peers put out some releases on some seemingly high bill impacts. And I know it's very specific to how your own vertically integrated portfolio is positioned. So just how should we kind of think about the impact of supply costs for Xcel customers?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Nick, good question. That's -- clearly, it's hit some headlines here in April as a result of that planning auction. And I would say it was unexpected by parties, right? You had the capacity payment last year, right, was $5 per megawatt per day, and it hit the cost of new entry here. And ultimately, MISO was short when you look at the numbers. I think it really highlights the importance of dispatchable generation in making this transition reliably and methodically. And I think you saw that in our commission decision with our resource plan, is they saw the need for us to add dispatchable generation as we shut down our coal units. And so -- but for us, in this auction specifically, we're long. And so it's a benefit to us. And ultimately, it will be a benefit to our customers. And the way we look at it is it will flow through in our Minnesota rate case and help us mitigate our electric rate case and hopefully facilitate a settlement. So overall, it's -- we're in a good position with the capacity auction. And it's important and just a credit to how we think about this transition and ensure that we have the capacity to serve our customers.
Nicholas Campanella: That's real helpful. And then just one cleanup question on the MISO transmission CapEx upside. Is it still for any kind of capital upside that's not in the plan today, should we still be thinking 50% equity funding there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. That's fair. I mean it was the one caveat that we've spoken about before is, no, we get federal legislation pass that does help us from a financing perspective, improves our credit metrics. So -- but if we don't get that, then that's a good way to think about how we finance incremental capital.
Nicholas Campanella: Thank you. See in New York in a little bit. Have a good one.
Brian Van Abel: Absolutely, looking forward to it.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Ryan Levine from Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. If the Colorado Resource Plan fell away from solar, how could this impact incremental CapEx connected to the Colorado Pathway, that there is some language in your presentation, I was hoping to clarify.
Brian Van Abel: So Ryan, I think you're talking about the potential incremental capital that we need for the Colorado Power Pathway that we have -- we have call it upside, but we haven't identified yet around voltage support system stability.
Ryan Levine: Correct.
Brian Van Abel: I think it really depends. It's a tough one to answer because it depends on exactly where these projects are or end up being located. And so I think it's a little bit too early to say if we shift some more to wind than solar because it is so location dependent, asset-dependent and how we think about it. So we certainly -- a broader point is we absolutely believe we need that capital, and it's just more of where it's going to be located. We've talked about it, a lot of it's -- I think of the 345 that we're building is a freeway and these are the on-ramps and off-ramps, and so we'll need it. But it's a fair question. We just don't -- there needs to be a little bit more visibility into what the actual portfolio could look like and a marginal shift between wind and solar probably doesn't change that number much.
Paul Johnson: And to be clear, Ryan, we've not made any change in our view of solar versus wind. It's really going to come through the RFP process, which will determine how many megawatts of solar, how many megawatts of wind are ultimately chosen.
Ryan Levine: Okay, and then one just broader question given some of the moving time lines with given supply chain challenges and some of the solar policies from the government. How broadly are you feeling about reliability within your service territory and needs for incremental capacity to help serve your customers?
Robert Frenzel: It's a great question. I appreciate it, Ryan. This is Bob. If you saw on both of our resource plans, we have continuing need for firm dispatchable resources. In the upper Midwest, we got a separate certificate process to build back firm capacity in the upper Midwest, similarly in the Colorado resource plan proposal. So we recognize the need for reliability. Now you'll see that we moved in the upper Midwest, for example, from a combined cycle to combustion turbines. We do think that with the geographic advantage in the place that we sit in the country, we do have high capacity factors for wind and coincident on peak solar. So we do think that the assets that need to come back are largely combustion turbines. We're prepared and have offered in all of our jurisdictions to be able to co-fire those with green hydrogen when and if that becomes available. And so we're looking at the very low capacity factors, but a real need for system reliability. As I think about CTs broadly, it's a bit of an insurance policy. We need them for the very rare times when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow and the batteries aren't available, but it's a great insurance policy to have.
Brian Van Abel: And Ryan, just to add on to that, I absolutely agree with what Bob said in terms of longer term. In the short term, certainly, we expected some solar plus storage projects come online in Colorado, and we're negotiating with the developers there about the impacts we're seeing. So we'll evaluate alternative opportunities to ensure we have reliability in the system.
Ryan Levine: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from David Peters from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
David Peters: Hey, good morning everyone. Just maybe curious to maybe get an update on some of the regulatory items in Minnesota near term. I think you have the Uri gas recovery case where an ALJ report is due soon. I know initially, you were pretty far off with some of the intervenor positions, but wasn't sure if conversations have developed since then to where you can maybe resolve that? And then just related, any commentary on the rate case, if any, I know it's early there.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Dave. And on Uri we are awaiting that ALJ decision, we should get it at the end of May about the 25th. And we're still fairly far apart with the office of Attorney General and Department of Commerce. I mean, if you read our testimony and our comments, we strongly disagree with their assertions. And we believe we acted prudently in accordingly to the commission approved hedging procedures, really for the best interest of our customers. So we'll await that ALJ recommendation. And then once you get the ALJ recommendation, it should likely be in August with the commission decision on that. On the rate cases, it is -- it's still early in the proceeding. There's a couple of other rate cases in front of us that they call it or have been serially working through. So we haven't a lot of discovery yet in the electric or gas case. So not a whole lot to update you on. But certainly, as we get through the year, like I said, we talked about, so the MISO capacity auction being helped mitigating the impacts we've seen really good sales growth in Minnesota and our economy is strong here in Minnesota. So it's a good thing to see that, hopefully, as we get later in the year and can start to talk about settlement opportunities with intervenors and we can reach a pretty constructive outcome for all of our parties.
David Peters: Great, thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Year-end 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact Media Relations with inquires and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 year-end conference call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have others from our management team here to help answer any questions you might have. This morning, we will review our 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Before we walk through year-end results, I want to reflect on the devastating wildfires that tour through Boulder County, Colorado just before the New Year. It's been a long four weeks since this historic tragedy ravaged our communities and resulted in two people losing their lives and over 1,200 homes and buildings being destroyed or damaged. Our hearts and thoughts are with all members of these communities who lost their homes, suffered damage or were displaced, including 17 of our own employees and their families. I'm truly grateful for our hundreds of employees, contractors and partners who exercised incredible diligence in keeping each other and our customers safe while working around the clock to get the lights and the heat back on especially over a holiday weekend with below zero temperatures and more than a foot of fresh snow in some areas. More than 100,000 electric customers experienced a sustained outage and service was largely restored within 48 hours. Our wildfire protocols require that we turn off natural gas service to over 13,000 customers as a safety precaution. And once it was safe, our employees with mutual aid assistance went door-to-door to manually relight pilot lights, restoring service within just three days. In addition to our crews, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our many employees and community members who volunteered alongside emergency responders, handing out space heaters and water bottles and collecting clothing donations. I'm so proud of how our team and partners led with compassion and deliver for our customers and communities in this extreme time of need. Officials continue to investigate the cause of the fire, but they confirmed there were no down power lines in the ignition area. Our systems remain resilient even as when 100-mile per hour winds propelled the fires due to our previously approved wildfire mitigation plan and our continued focus on operational excellence. As we always do, our team rallied to the call guided by our four values connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. Moving on to our 2021 results. We had another very successful year, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. First and foremost, throughout the pandemic, we continue to provide safe, reliable service to our customers and support to our employees and our communities. Financially, we delivered EPS of $2.96 representing 17th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend for the 18th straight year, increasing it by $0.11 per share. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements in several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including Yuri storm cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project, and we anticipate commission decisions on these settlements by the end of the first quarter. Our nuclear fleet remains the top-performing fleet in the country, achieved a capacity factor of over 92% last year. We also installed over 300,000 smart meters as part of our advanced grid program and plan to install more than 1 million in 2022. Continue to lead the country in carbon reduction, in 2021, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 50% below 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030. As planned, we completed four wind farms with 800 megawatts of capacity, which provides significant environmental benefits and cost savings for our customers. We also accelerated our time line for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal-free by the end of 2034. 2021, we extended our clean energy leadership to our natural gas business, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 and deliver net zero natural gas service by 2050 for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing 12 new programs for our customers receiving approval for our New Mexico plan and preparing for increased levels of electric vehicle adoption across our eight states. We're also recognized for our continued ESG leadership, named among the world's both ethical companies, the best veteran employers and for disability inclusion in the workplace. And finally, we introduced a compensation-based diversity metric and earned a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index for the 6th consecutive year. I'm proud to lead a team that can deliver on financial, operational, environmental, customer and diversity goals simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. The transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible transitions as we retire our coal plants. Together, our resource plans will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. In December, we reached a settlement in our Colorado resource plan that will accelerate the retirement of our Comanche 3 coal unit to 2034 in advance our Pawnee plant conversion to natural gas to 2026, while maintaining plans to add approximately 4,000 megawatts of renewables and reduced carbon 87% by 2030. We also reached a settlement in our $1.7 billion pathway transmission project in Colorado. The pathway will provide 560 miles of double-circuit 345 kV lines to enable 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state. The settlement includes a certificate of need, rider recovery and a potential for a 90-mile line extension with an additional investment of $250 million to enable access to some of the richest wind resources in the region. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans and the pathway transmission project in the first quarter of the year. As we've previously discussed, our capital investment plan is not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, the energy provisions that were included in the build better legislation would provide substantial customer benefits and help enable the clean energy transition. While that legislation has stalled, there is some discussion that a more modest version could potentially move forward this year. This could include new and extended tax credits for wind, solar, hydrogen, storage, nuclear and transmission along with a direct pay option for the tax credits. Continue to advocate for these provisions, which will be beneficial for our customers and as President, Biden has suggested there may be congressional support for energy and climate bill with a more modest price tag than the original build-back better bill. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.96 per share for 2021 compared with $2.79 per share in 2020. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.41 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.17 per share. Production tax credits lowered the ETR, however, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.24 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Higher other taxes, primarily property taxes decreased earnings by $0.03 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.7% in 2021 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. We anticipate weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% in 2022. Shifting to expenses. Our O&M spend was flat in 2021. This continues an existing trend as we kept our O&M flat since 2014, while adding significant renewables and capital investment. We expect O&M will increase 1% to 2% in 2022, driven by wind farm additions, increased spending on electric vehicle programs and other customer initiatives. Turning to regulatory. We reached an unopposed settlement in our Colorado electric case, which will provide a net rate increase of $177 million based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% in the 2021 test year. Every settlement is based on compromises, and we feel this is a constructive outcome for all parties. Hearings were completed last week, and we expect the commission decision in March. We also reached a black box settlement principle in our Texas Electric case, which provides a rate increase of approximately $89 million. The agreement also accelerates the depreciation life of the coal plant to 2034. The commission decision is anticipated later this year. Moving to Minnesota. In December, the commission approved interim rates of $247 million for electric customers and $25 million for natural gas customers. The commission granted interim rates as requested for our natural gas operations but lowered our electrical request by $41 million due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic on residential customers. They made similar adjustments for CenterPoint and Minnesota Power. The schedules for both cases are included in the earnings release, and we expect commission decisions in mid-2023. Earlier this week, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado, seeking a net rate increase of $107 million in 2022 with incremental step increases of $40 million in 2023 and $41 million in 2024. The request was driven by significant capital investments for customer growth, safety, reliability and resiliency and is based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55.6%, in the 2022 current test year. Our average Colorado residential customers' natural gas bill was 24% below the national average in 2020, among the lowest in the country. We anticipate a commission decision later this year and final rates to be implemented in November 2022. Shifting to earnings. We've updated our 2022 guidance assumptions largely to reflect 2021 actual results. Details are included in our earnings release. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term 5% to 7% EPS growth objective. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We delivered 2021 earnings guidance within our guidance range, the 17th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy by adding 800-megawatt wind to our system. We remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and plan to be coal-free by 2034. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Michigan. We also reached constructive settlements and several additional regulatory proceedings in Colorado, including storm Yuri cost recovery, our resource plan and the pathway transmission project. We've kept our O&M expenses flat since 2014. We reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance, and we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping this well for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.
Insoo Kim: Just first question, maybe for Brian, touching on your O&M growth forecast comment now 1% to 2% versus 1% that you had given in the third quarter earnings. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what's driving this, whether it's more demand-driven or are we seeing some impact of cost inflation that's getting impacted here? And also how confident you think some of those other offsets that you've included in the drivers could get you to keep you on pace?
Brian Van Abel: Good morning, Insoo. Yes, and if we look at our -- I'll start just with the updates on the guidance changes. And most are just updating to actuals when we look at 2020 year-end versus the guidance we gave in Q3 for 2022. And that's exactly what it is for O&M. Our O&M number in 2022 didn't change. But what happened is our O&M for the end of the year ended up lower than it was. So what you're seeing is just an update to actuals. We had lower benefits costs in Q4 of 2021 and also manage through some of the weather impacts that we saw in 2021. So, we're comfortable with our O&M guidance in 2022 that 1% to 2%, like I said, is just a function of where '21 landed.
Insoo Kim: Yes, I did see that. And I think the '21 levels were still below the 2019 level. So that makes sense. Okay. Second question, the -- it seems like in the fourth quarter, you did a pretty healthy amount of ATM equity, $350 million or so. How does that fit into your five-year plan of up to $800 million that you've laid out? And just out on the front loading, it seems of a lot of equity up frontiers, especially given we don't know what will happen with spill back better or any of the energy-related provisions, but you have said in the past that direct pay provision could meaningfully reduce your equity needs. Thanks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Good question, Insoo. And I look at our 2022 to 2026 capital plans and financing plans is just at the five-year. And so -- but we've been transparent in terms of the incremental capital is generally financed, we call 50-50. And if you think about where we were last year, meaning our last five-year plan, '21 through '25 rolling forward, we added about $2.5 billion of capital. And so the way I think about it is, yes, we're opportunistic in issuing some equity and add that to the $800 million of equity in our plan today because DRIP was it the same in both, and it was about $1.15 billion. So if you look at the $2.5 billion of capital we added, so it's right on kind of right in line with how we talk about financing incremental capital. So hopefully, that makes sense is kind of look and plan over plan. But you're absolutely right. As we think about the potential for clean energy legislation and the opportunity that gives us that absolutely still rings true in terms of being able to significantly reduce our equity needs going forward if that does pass. And or vice versa, we could really potentially accelerate investment without the need for incremental equity. So, I think it gives us a lot of flexibility going forward if it does happen.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congrats on continued progress here, especially in Colorado. I just wanted to bring up this pathway project, kudos on pending a deal there. I'm just curious if you could elaborate here on how that fits into the potential upside that you guys articulated earlier, the $0.5 billion to $1 billion that potential incremental for '22 to '26. And also, if you could clarify, the settlement seems like, it's 1.7, it's what you asked for, but you also alluded to this potential further network upgrades. Is that something else that we should be looking for to come out of the settlement or what have you?
Bob Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob, great to hear you this morning. Appreciate the interest in the Colorado Pathway Project. It's obviously very strategic for us, as we look to transition that state to an 87% carbon reduction and greater than 80% renewables by the end of the decade. I think if you went back and looked at the filings, what we asked for was a base plan of about $1.7 billion of capital to enable that almost 600-mile project. That $1.7 billion also had in the filings in the original filings is we call it an extension that would enable access to the best wind resources in the state. I think it was, it's conditional approval based on whether or not we have projects that show up in our RFP in that region and whether we'll build it or not. When I think about the incremental capital that we laid out, there's a couple of pieces in the pathway program that would take that $1.7 billion, somewhere higher. The first one is this $250 million extension. And then, as we've said since the outset of the Pathway project, we have to, at some point, ultimately interconnect all of the assets that get proposed to us in the RFP. And those interconnections come with additional upgrades on the transmission system to enable voltage support and stability. And those may -- depending on the ultimate locations of the projects that are picked, those could happen out in the Eastern planes of Colorado that could be more in the Metroplex. We don't know exactly where that's going to happen until the final projects are picked. And that's -- we know they'll cost some money. We just don't know what it is and where exactly it will happen. So that's where the incremental capital comes from, but we expect it to be needed.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just to clarify that...
Brian Van Abel: I would say just in terms of timing and visibility in the incremental spend, like Bob said, we know what needs to happen. We just don't know the timing and type of it yet. But once we get through the RFP process later this year and have identified the actual resources and where they're going to be located, whether it's wind or solar, then we'll have a really good visibility into what the transmission upgrades will be needed and when they'll be needed, probably latter half of this five-year plan early in kind of the second five.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But maybe to clarify that further, you talked about this $1 billion to $0.5 billion to $1 billion transmission upside in the current five-year plan. It sounds like you're edging towards the higher end of that incremental piece. And then ultimately, if I can push you a little bit on this, you've alluded to this in the remarks, I mean, whether it's Colorado or the Minnesota or Colorado IRPs, when do we get a more fully baked view on your CapEx? I know you said that, that's coming in the first quarter here, but it sounds like considering the RFPs, et cetera, that may be more of an EEI or even next year at this time, kind of update to get a more fully fleshed view?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I think let me answer your first question around, well, that, call it, in the transmission settlement, the conditional approval of that extension of $250 million, that certainly is helpful when we look at that $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And that's a really -- I mean, as Bob said in his opening remarks, that's really goes to a very resource-rich wind region that would be beneficial for our customers. And really, the parties just want to make sure that we get projects appearing there, and that's why it's conditional approval. So if you assume that's already part of the $500 million to $1 billion, you could see how there's -- will be incremental opportunities that will push that number closer to the midpoint or higher. On your second question around really timing. So what's going to happen, we'll get decisions in both Minnesota and Colorado on the resource plans from the commission in Q1. And then, we'll move into the RFP phase, which is likely going to be two, three, four months beyond those decisions, and then we have to work through that process. So Colorado could move a bit quicker in terms of getting clarity around from Colorado as we think about that process. Minnesota might be a little bit later than that. But there will be opportunities as we work through it and get through the RFP phase and make filings with commission where there'll be more visibility kind of throughout the process.
Operator: All right. Next question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to kind of start off with MISO MTEP process here. And just seeing if you could share any other thoughts on the time line? And what is the potential for the process to bear fruit for the current plan? Or where could that come in, in the future?
Bob Frenzel: Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Similar to Colorado, we're really excited about the opportunity for transmission expansion in all of our regions as it will enable additional renewable penetration that we can deliver to our customers. In particular, in MISO, we've been very active with the MISO steering committee and the MISO transmission owners. Recently, we've agreed to cost allocation mechanisms across MISO and new proposed tariffs, which we expect to deliver next month, which puts us on a schedule for MISO to release what they would say is MTEP 2021 by, I'll call it, midyear. And our expectation for MTEP21 is a subset of the projects that are included in MISO's future ones. So if you go back to the original source document, MISO released three futures of the world. We've been largely talking about future one and future three. Future one was about a $30 billion transmission expansion in the Upper Midwest or throughout MISO region. And then future three was really the other goalpost was about $100 billion investment needed to enable a significant carbon reduction across all of MISO footprint. Our expectation for future one is that as a company, we're probably likely to get about 20% of the transmission opportunities that are included in future one. We expect MTEP21 to be a subset of future one, so a smaller subset than the $30 billion worth of projects.
Paul Johnson: And Jeremy, it's probably important to point out, too, that we don't have any material MISO transmission in our first five-year forecast.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then, maybe just pivoting over to Minnesota and the yearly proceeding there, I was wondering if you might be able to provide any comments or thoughts there? And does this provide any indications or takeaways related to the Minnesota rate case?
Bob Frenzel: Yes, it's Bob. I'm not certain I would put a lot of linkage between those two proceedings. As I think about Yuri in the Minnesota case, I think about so the unprecedented event that happened last February. And it's not unexpected to have parties question, the investments that we made to enable our system reliability at the time. In Minnesota, in particular, working through that regulatory proceeding, we filed what I would say is extensive testimony and -- just last week, we filed rebuttal testimony. We obviously disagree with the positions of the OAG and the department on the disallowances they proposed. And look, we'll continue to work with the commission through the proceeding. But I wouldn't put a lot of linkage between a Yuri proceeding and the Minnesota electric or gas cases.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. Just a last one for me here. You might be able to provide more color on the process for converting Pawnee to natural gas by 2026. And what the potential cost for conversions could be and over what time frame should we expect this to occur?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I expect that conversion cost to be relatively small. And that's really one of the reasons why we propose to convert Pawnee versus Comanche just because the conversion costs are that. And right in 2026, I expect the conversions really to be in the back half of this five-year forecast. So that's really -- assuming we get approval for it, we think it is certainly the right path to ensure that we have system reliability with converting the pony to gas and having that. But in terms of conversion, it is not significant.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, maybe just to kick things off, I have two questions. First, just on the macro, I appreciate the commentary on bill, back better. Sorry if I missed it, but you didn't touch on AMT. I'm just wondering if -- I know industry sort of leaders in the last few weeks, last few months as sort of lobbied against it. Is that something that you think perhaps comes out in the process of negotiations or what are your latest thoughts there?
Brian Van Abel: Durgesh, good morning, and thanks for the question. Let's -- I think it really depends is what is the size -- assuming something can get done and there seems to be pretty good support for the clean energy provisions. But the question is then what is the pay for and what's the size of the clean energy provisions, right? You've heard around this number of a $500-plus billion climate provision package being put forth. There also seems to be pretty good support for the Medicare/prescription drug change, which is a revenue raiser of about $300 billion. So I really think I haven't from -- certainly from what we have heard is AMT is not off the table. I think it all depends on what size of the package they can get support from. I mean for us, certainly, if the climate provisions were passed and like Bob said in his opening remarks, we strongly support those clean energy provisions. They are great for our customers in terms of driving this clean transition, meaning able to do it more affordably. But if AMT wasn't included in that, that is just better for us as we talk about the overall impacts of the clean energy provisions plus AMT -- but if we actually just didn't have AMT, that improves our cash flow metrics probably by about 15 basis points, so relatively minor. But I think to your question, is more to come as we think about how this could play out and really how they look paying for the overall smaller package.
Bob Frenzel: Dugresh, I'd just add one more thing to what Brian said is. One, I think we've concluded that the AMP in and of itself isn't all that impactful for Xcel Energy as it allows the use of existing renewable credits to fund it. I think the other thing that we would look to, though, as an industry in mitigating the AMP is really the fact that, on one hand, the federal government is giving you a lot of tax credits to incentivize development of renewable assets. And then on the other hand, if you have an AMT funding requirements, you're almost notifying some of the incentives that come with those tax credits. So where I think the discussion would go with lawmakers is can we use tax credits funded in the clean energy provisions to offset the AMT provisions. And ultimately, if you think about AMT and our industry, it's paid for by our customers. And so it's just -- it's an increase in tax to our existing customers. And I think that would be an area that we would negotiate with lawmakers as well. So it's still included in what we see as provisions in the build, back, better plan, but all subject to negotiation.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you for that color. And then just one quick clarification, if I may. On the MISO process, you mentioned mid-2022. I think we've sort of seen some bids around May. Did that move or are we still expecting some sort of CapEx announcement, project announcements in May?
Bob Frenzel: Well, I think May is probably the target. I might have been hedging a bit by saying it could slip into June, but I think it's -- we're talking about maybe a month to -- and I'm not saying it's going to slip. I just -- I was hedging my own comments.
Operator: All right. Next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Dave Arcaro: It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering in Colorado, have your views of fire risk changed in light of the catastrophic fires we saw? And wondering if there are adjustments that you might make or consider to your wildfire mitigation plans in the state?
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, a tragedy in Colorado and the Marshall Fire and with everything like that, we learned from it. We've been focused as a company on climate-driven resiliency for a long time, and we followed in Colorado, our wildfire mitigation program back in 2019, and we're executing under that program. I'm sure there's always ways that we can learn from these strategies and improve the risk for the customers for sure. The commissions open a proceeding and we're going to actively participate with them on exploring your exact question on things that are in the approved wildfire plan and things we might want to consider in the future, but that -- we're early stages in that.
Dave Arcaro: Understood. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious on sales growth in the quarter, saw weather normal resi sales down a decent amount. I was just wondering if you might be able to comment around that and just comfort level with the 2022 sales growth outlook where you sit today?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. I think I kind of look at it over the balance of the year of 2021. If you recall, going into the year, we thought sales growth was going to be about 1%. We ended up -- ended at 1.7% on a weather-normalized basis. And really, our C&I forecast was pretty close. What was higher than expected was on the residential side. And what we saw is that residential stickiness through most of 2021. So I think you saw some of that give back in Q4, a little bit of that weakness when you look over the Q-over-Q numbers. So as I think about 2022, that was our expectation even going into 2020 to continued C&I strength. Our economies, our service territories have stronger forecasted GSP than the national GDP. We have forecasting strong job growth. So I feel good on the C&I side. And we do expect those residential numbers to decline a little bit as you go to return to more a little bit more, call it, return to normal. So, we do feel comfortable with where we're sitting for 2022 on the overall basis with stronger C&I sales offsetting some of the residential decline.
Bob Frenzel: The other point to make, too, is that we did have some pretty extreme weather in the fourth quarter. And while we feel comfortable with our weather normalization process, when the weather extremes get kind of more extreme, it makes it a little bit more difficult to determine the weather versus the sales impact. So, there could be a little bit of noise there.
Operator: All right. Next, we'll go to Paul Fremont with Mizuho.
Paul Fremont: Great. I just wanted to sort of look at the additional equity issuance. And is it fair to sort of infer that with that additional equity issuance that you would at least be somewhat into the incremental CapEx spend that you guys have identified on a go-forward basis?
Brian Van Abel: Paul, I think if you're talking about the ATM that we did in Q4, the way I think about it is the plan -- the '22 to '26 plan that we have in front of us is the equity needed for that plan. And really, the equity last year was related to that last five-year plan, and I'll explain it a little bit. Is when we rolled the forward five-year plans, we added $2.5 billion of capital. And for us, credit quality and balance sheet strength is important. And we've always talked about funding incremental capital with about 50% equity. And if you kind of look at what we did at the end of Q4 plus that $800 million gets you just under 50% equity funding when we look at kind of the two plants together. So I think we're comfortable there for us. Like I said, credit quality and credit strength is important at Xcel and our operating companies. It's important to have access to capital. And so when you look at our current five-year plan going forward, right, that equity financings hold true. And certainly, like I said, if something happens on the clean energy provision, federally, we'll revisit those as that gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of financing.
Bob Frenzel: Paul, it's important to recognize what we did in 2021 was always part of our '21 plan. So it's not any change to what we had envisioned going forward.
Paul Fremont: Okay. And then -- in the past, I guess, you guys have talked about contract buyouts. There seems to be sort of less focus on that. But can you give us any update on contract buyout opportunities? Or do you see any within that '22 to '26 period?
Brian Van Abel: I don't think -- I wouldn't characterize it as any less focus. The corporate development team reports directly to me, and we're in constant discussions with developers. I think a little bit is what you see as we're in a resource plans in our two major jurisdictions, and working through those proceedings and then we have RFPs coming up, and that could be an avenue for developers to bid in potential opportunities within those RFPs. And I think it'd be -- I think our commissions, given that we have those RFPs coming up, that's the preference they had if sitting here today, if we had any projects to bring forward, they'd prefer to see them in those RFPs. But we always focus on it. I've talked -- and I've always talked about it as being opportunistic. And it will be opportunistic because it has to work for our customers. We won't bring forward an opportunity to our commissions if it doesn't save our customers' money.
Bob Frenzel: Paul, we've been successful in the strategy. I think we've deployed more than $0.5 billion in capital in this strategy. And I think there's another $0.5 billion to $1 billion more opportunities for us, but they are, as Brian said, very opportunistic and likely to see some of that as we go through the resource planning processes and Colorado over the next year or so.
Paul Fremont: Great. And then my last question. When you talk about sales growth of 1% this year, on a normalized basis beyond this year, would you -- what would be sort of an expectation, a more normalized expectation for the outer years?
Brian Van Abel: I think longer term, it's beyond this year as we continue to recover, and our sales are still below where we were pre-COVID levels. I think longer term, it's relatively flat with the exception is EV adoption as that starts to increase and pick up, we'll start to see some sales growth. We see our EV goal of 20% of EVs in our service territory by 2030, adding about 7/10th of a percent over a decade. So, I think it's relatively flat until we start to see some more EV penetration in larger numbers over the longer term.
Operator: Your next question will be from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: Good morning everyone. Thank you. You answered my question on the Colorado wildfires. Just one quick follow-up to that. Have you heard or been involved in discussions that kind of give more momentum to the whole clean energy transition, I mean, climate change and such following the wildfires? Is that accelerated or enhanced some of the clean energy discussion?
Bob Frenzel: Travis, it's Bob. Look, I think our stakeholders in Colorado, including the Company itself, have been very aggressively pushing a clean energy transition. In fact, our goals in Colorado have us reducing our carbon footprint by 87% by the end of the decade on the electric side. And just in November, we committed on the natural gas side to reduce emissions on the natural gas business by the end of the decade and then be net zero by mid-century in the gas business. So I think the conversations in Colorado continue on that front with that as the backdrop. I've seen articles in the paper that talk about climate change and things like that. But I think the path we're on is absolutely aligned with the policyholders and stakeholders in Colorado. So, there may be increased discussion, but I think the trajectory that we're on is the right one.
Travis Miller: Sure. Okay. Great. And then second question same in Colorado, there see earned ROEs for the year we're in a low 8% range. Once you get that electric rate case in there, call it, in the first quarter, early second quarter, does that jump up? Does that get you to of a 9% type range closer to the allowed? Or is there something in Colorado, the rate structures, et cetera, where it's just very, very difficult for you to get to the nine-plus percent?
Brian Van Abel: Travis, I don't see significant improvement into 2022. One is no rates won't be effective until April on the electric side. You did see us file a gas case here very recently. And we're still -- we do face regulatory lag there with the test year on the electric side really being kind of a midyear '21. So we'll continue to work with our stakeholders and the commissions on that side, but I don't see the ROE improving significantly in 2022.
Travis Miller: Okay. And is it the historical test year that just makes a big difference, 100 basis points or so?
Brian Van Abel: I mean I haven't done that math, but the historical test year, particularly when you're investing significant amount of capital into the system, helping drive this clean energy transition in that historical test year does put some pressure on your earned ROEs.
Operator: All right, it looks like there are no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to Xcel Energy's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and a few others. This morning, we will review our 2021 results, share recent business and regulatory developments, update our capital and financing plan, and provide 2022 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn over to Bob.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Today, we reported solid third quarter earnings of $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. And given our strong year-to-date results, we're narrowing our 2021 guidance to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We're also initiating 2022 guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which reflects our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objective. Consistent with our past tradition, we've updated our base investment plan, reflecting $26 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years, which provides significant benefits to our customers and supports community vitality. This investment plan delivers rate base growth of 6.5% off of a projected 2021 year-end rate base. This plan is robust, but there are certain investment opportunities that are not included in our base plan, including potential renewable generation assets authorized in our Minnesota or Colorado resource plan proceedings and additional transmission capital that's needed to integrate new renewable generation additions in Colorado beyond the base Colorado power pathway proposal. The base plan also does not include any capital for green hydrogen production for our LDC or generation needs, which we believe could be material over the balance of the decade. We have our hydrogen pilot at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, and we're exploring five to eight additional greenfield and brownfield projects. And with favorable state backdrops in Minnesota and in Colorado, which have passed clean fuel legislation as well as a potential for a federal hydrogen production tax credit, we believe that our favorable renewable generation conditions will help us push beyond pilots and into green hydrogen production resources that can be valuable to a clean energy future. I'm very excited about our investment plan, which supports continued execution of our long-term strategy and clean energy leadership. It provides for sustainability of our local communities, enhances reliability and resiliency, advances our fleet transition, keeps customer bills low, and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We're well positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including renewable additions in our proposed Minnesota and Colorado resource plans and the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources. Together, our resource plans are going to add nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system and achieve an 85% carbon reduction by 2030, while keeping customer bills at or below the rate of inflation. We expect decisions on both the Minnesota and the Colorado resource plans in the first quarter of next year. The clean energy transition is also going to need substantial transmission investment. We continue to make good progress in the Colorado power pathway transmission project, which is essential for us to deliver on our Colorado energy resource plan. It will enable over 5,500 megawatts of new renewables in the state, and it's vital as we explore further western market integration over time. To-date, comments from most parties have been generally supportive, and we expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2022. In the Midwest, MISO has experienced some minor delays, but we still expect MTEP21 to be announced in the first half of next year. We also had a strong operational quarter. Our industry-leading nuclear fleet set another record, with two units having run over 700 consecutive days prior to their refueling outages. Another highlight this quarter was the dedication of the 300-megawatt Bighorn solar facility at the EVRAZ steel mill in Pueblo, Colorado. In partnership with Lightsource BP and state and local leaders, we've enabled the largest on-site solar array in the country serving a single customer. This is a really creative solution between multiple parties to ensure the continued operation and expansion of the steel mill and its 1,100 employees. It reduces carbon emissions and creates valuable property tax base that helps sustain the local economy. We also continue to partner with our states and OEMs to electrify the transportation sector. This quarter, we implemented new programs for our Colorado customers that will help us to achieve our goal of enabling 1.5 million electric vehicles across our states by 2030. We appreciate the collaboration with so many stakeholders as we collectively work to reduce carbon emissions and enable sustainable communities. We remain well-positioned with a sound strategy, a robust five-year capital plan, and sustainable long-term growth trajectory that provides attractive returns to our investors, while keeping bills low for our customers. These plans are not dependent on changes in federal policy. However, it's our understanding that Biden administration has reached an agreement on a framework for the reconciliation package, which would include extensions for investment tax credits and production tax credits, a solar and a hydrogen production tax credit, a storage and a transmission investment tax credit and direct pay options for all tax credits. This proposed plan creates significant customer benefits by lowering the cost of our proposed resource plans and potentially accelerating our clean energy transition. Our steel for fuel program has demonstrated our geographic advantages in renewables. Proposed tax credit expenses for ITCs and PTCs, including the solar production tax credit, will make future projects even more competitive, providing additional benefit to our customers. Additionally, a direct pay option would provide greater financial flexibility, increased corporate cash flow and credit metrics, which would reduce our financing needs. A PTC for green hydrogen would also bring significant value and technology advancement and costs. It could help accelerate the time frame in which we could begin incorporating hydrogen into power generation and into our natural gas distribution operations at a cost that's more economic for our customers. While discussions continue at the federal level on the final bill, we are optimistic that this plan will be passed and will have significant benefits to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, recording $1.13 per share compared with $1.14 per share last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings are $0.13 per share ahead of last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.04 per share primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And in addition, the lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.01 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.03 per share. Turning to sales. Weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 2.4% in the third quarter, while our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.9%. Given our year-to-date results and the continued economic rebound in our states, we're updating our full year weather-adjusted electric sales growth to approximately 1.5% to 2%. Shifting to expenses. O&M expenses declined 1.9% for the quarter and increased 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. Quarterly O&M expense comparisons are noisy with the COVID impacts from last year, but overall, we expect our O&M expenses to increase approximately 1% for the year. Turning to regulatory, we reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado, and are making strong progress on potential Texas rate case settlement. As a reminder, last quarter we reached constructive settlements in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota rate cases. In October, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the Colorado staff in the Colorado Energy office that proposes to resolve several regulatory proceedings. Key terms include: we will fully recover all Winter Storm Uri deferred fuel costs over 24 months for electric and over 30 months from the natural gas LDC customers, with no carrying charges through a rider. Please note, the Uri Storm cost estimate for Colorado was revised to $550 million. We will refund to electric customers approximately $41 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the 2020 decoupling program. We'll forgo recovery of approximately $14 million of replacement power costs incurred due to an extended Comanche three outage during 2020. And we will not seek recovery of approximately $11 million of deferred COVID-19 bad debt expense. We are pleased that we were able to reach this comprehensive settlement, which represents compromises from all the parties and take steps to mitigate the customer impact of the Uri cost recovery. We expect a commission decision in the first half of 2022. In terms of pending rate cases, we are making progress in settlement discussions in our Texas case. As a result, the hearing schedule has been abated, and we are hopeful that we'll ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement. We expect a decision on our Colorado electric case in March of next year with new rates effective in April. As a reminder, we're seeking a net rate increase of approximately $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 55.6% in the 2022 forecast test year. The case is largely driven by capital investment. In October, we filed the Minnesota electric rate case seeking a net increase of $677 million over three years. The filing is based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and equity ratio of 52.5% in forecast test years. We requested interim rates of $288 million to be implemented in January 2022. Finally, we plan to file a Minnesota gas rate case in early November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a stay-out option as we look to help mitigate bill impacts of Uri cost recovery for our customers. As Bob mentioned, we have issued a robust $26 billion 5-year capital forecast, which is detailed in our earnings release. Our base capital plan results in rate base growth of approximately 6.5% using 2021 as a base. The base forecast reflects significant grid investment in our Colorado power pathway proposal and other transmission system investments to maintain asset health and reliability and enable renewable generation. The plan reflects a modest level of renewables including our proposed Sherco solar facility. It also includes two natural gas peaking plants to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants, along with investments to improve the customer experience. Beyond our base capital forecast, we anticipate potential incremental capital investment for renewables associated with the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. Our proposed resource plans include approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewable additions from 2024 to 2026, which would result in incremental capital investment of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, assuming 50% ownership. In addition, we anticipate the need for incremental $500 million to $1 billion of related transmission for the Colorado IRP. Combined, we could see a potential incremental investment to support the clean energy transition of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in the latter part of this five-year forecast. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. We expect to issue $800 million of equity and $450 million of DRIP and benefits equity over the next five years. The financing plan maintains our current credit metrics and strong balance sheet, which is important for maintaining a low cost of capital for our customers. We expect the equity would likely be issued through an ATM over the five years. We anticipate that any incremental capital would be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. However, our equity needs could be significantly reduced if the reconciliation package is passed with the current framework. Shifting to earnings, we are initiating our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Key assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. In addition, we've updated the base of our growth rate to $2.96 per share, which represents the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance range. This represents 6.5% growth in the base between 2020 and 2021. With that, I'll wrap-up with a quick summary. We reached a comprehensive settlement in Colorado that resolved several regulatory proceedings. We are making progress towards the settlement of our Texas rate case. We narrowed our 2021 guidance range to $2.94 to $2.98 per share. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and customer value. We initiated 2022 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we continue leading the clean energy transition and keeping bills low for our customers. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy
Brian Van Abel: Good morning Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks. I just want to start off on the load side, if I could. What types of customers drove the C&I growth there? And how did residential perform relative to your expectations heading into the quarter? Just trying to see how you think these respective classes would be trending into 2022, particularly with retained residential load.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, so I think residential has been stickier than the, call it, forecasted going into this year. And we expected to give back some of the, call it, the residential gains that we saw last year, but it's been sticky. If you look at a year-to-date basis, residential is up 1.8%. So, I think that's -- that was one of the big drivers of our updated guidance for the year. And a lot of that is in Colorado, if you look at where Colorado has been. We also see strong customer growth on the residential side across all of our service territories. Residential permits or building permits are significantly up. On the C&I side, I think it's -- we're really seeing good rebound in -- across all C&I sectors in our opcos. But really, the Permian Basin is coming back. We focus a lot on what's happening with our oil and gas customers in SPS. And we look at some substations that directly serve those loads, and that load is up 25% even relative to pre-pandemic levels. And so we're hearing our -- those customers are disciplined, but continue to drill. And also, they're looking at electrification. They're feeling ESG pressure and that is a big focus on electrifying drill rigs, pumps, compressors, certainly good load growth for us. So, I think we're pleasantly surprised with the strength of our sales and confident that it will continue into next year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And just on residential for next year, do you expect more kind of a give back? Or have we kind of hit a new normal as far as kind of partial work from home, what have you?
Brian Van Abel: I think we expect a slow give back. I think there'll be an amount of stickiness long term that will be there as you think about return to work, and I'll give you our example. We have a telecommuting policy for our employees when they come back to work. so they'll be able to work from home on a part-time basis. And I think we'll see that stickiness for a long time, but I do think it will start to come down from last year and this year a little bit.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, that's helpful. Certainly, the Northern Delaware there and New Mexico, really a lot of activity, good to see it coming through for you there. And then I just want to pivot, I guess, it's a bit early for MISO's MTEP process. But just wondering what your current thoughts are, what you might be able to say as far as the first wave of projects that could come out there. Could you frame your expectations of the timing of the release, the volume of the investments expected, potential start/completion of project announced.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy, it's Bob. I agree that the analysis and the output of MTEP21 has been probably slower than we expected. We do expect a series of MTEPs over the next number of years that will continue to highlight the need for transmission expansion in the upper Midwest. My expectations for 2021 are reasonable maybe modest. I think we'll see more in 2022 and 2023. I think the time line for construction is probably at the very tail of this five-year plan, but probably more in the back half of the decade for these projects. It's going to take a while to get through once you file the proceeding. It's going to take a while to get through permitting and things like that, and then actual construction. So, probably outside of our five-year forecast, but really in the five to 10 years after that.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Just one last one, if I could. For the incremental CapEx, how do you expect line of sight to develop here as the IRP process continues? Could the opportunity be fully defined in 2022? Or do you expect it to take more time?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I expect 2022 for it to really shape up. Call it a year from now, we should have a real good clarity. Q1 of next year, we expect the Phase 1s of those resource plans in both Minnesota and in Colorado to be approved by their commissions and -- with a substantial amount of renewable opportunity and growth in each of our jurisdictions, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. We'll go through Phase two processes through Q2 and Q3 of next year, and we expect to be back here next year having some pretty good clarity on the outcomes.
Robert Frenzel: And for clarification, Phase two is the request for proposal to determine how much is PPA versus BOTs and ownership.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question, and apologies if I missed it, is on the Minnesota side of things for Uri cost recovery process. Where are we in that process? And similar to what you got on the Colorado side, do you think that there is a potential for a constructive settlement there?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So, Insoo, this is Brian. So, in terms of Uri in Minnesota, the commission has approved recovery of the cost over 27 months, subject to a prudency review. There is some disputed amounts. If you remember, the Department of Commerce disputed about $20 million of our costs and the OAG disputed about $34 million of our costs. So, we'll work through that proceeding. We'd expect to see intervenor testimony late December and then a commission decision mid-next year. Now, we feel like we've acted prudently and filed commission-approved hedging policies. And we feel good about working through the process of the commission and expect to reach a constructive outcome.
Insoo Kim: Got it. And a second question just a little bit longer term, maybe for Bob. You're seeing a lot of other utilities in their generation transformation plan, putting out time line for coal retirement from the 2030s and even 2040 period to the late 2020s and whatnot. I know in your Colorado and Minnesota jurisdictions, you have the IRPs that have been filed that are -- that call for acceleration and have robust plans in place. But just how much further acceleration opportunity do you think is possible, given the current regulatory frameworks that are in place? And maybe from a financial and reliability perspective as well, and what other helper items do you think are needed to that could further support acceleration?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, that's a great question. And look, we've been a leader in coal plant transitions over the last decade. And we expect, over the next decade, to close the majority of the coal plants on our systems across the country. We'll be out of coal in the Upper Midwest by the end of this decade. We're -- we have plans and approved plans to close a coal plant almost every single year this decade, which we've done a great job of transitioning to communities and the employees as part of that program. Our philosophy has been long runways, Insoo, making sure that we take care of the communities, the property tax base. We get a chance to do economic development and bring businesses back to those communities that have supported us and those assets for decades. So, with the proposal on the table for production tax credits that are part of the reconciliation bill, I think you're going to see with a 10-year window, we've got a long runway to manage this transition. And I think for the company, we are going to potentially accelerate areas that might have been a bit behind, as best we can. But these resource plans are very much in the works. And so we expect to work through these resource plans, and we file about every three years. So, come 2024, so we'd have another bite at the apple to think about the remaining assets on our fleet in those transitions. I think at the core, though, we need to identify that next generation of generation. We were the first company to announce we'd be carbon-free by 2050. I think what we need is another type of emissions-free generation. And I think the infrastructure bill triples DOE funding for research and development. I think that's critical for the industry to progress past where we expect to be, which is about an 80%, 85% carbon reduction by the end of the decade.
Insoo Kim: That makes sense. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. Perhaps just a pickup on the reconciliation 
Robert Frenzel: Hey Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Maybe just a pickup on the reconciliation point. I wanted to follow-up on this. Just how are you thinking about the potential for expanding repowering here, depending on the various combinations on PTCs here? I mean, it seems like your position might be particularly enviable when it comes to leveraging an expanded PTC. Could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on some of the opportunities that could emerge there? I mean, I know we've been talking about repowering in various forms here for a bit.
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Look, repowering is a great opportunity for us. We've been leaders in wind for 15 years. So, we've got some assets that have moved past their PTC dates, and we've got a lot of wind on our system already. We have four repowerings underway already that were approved as part of the R&R plan here in Minnesota. And I think that this bill again, which lacks a lot of definition and clarity but would provide people who've owned wind for a long time to repower those assets. So, we haven't delved into the details on our side on our legacy assets and what this would open up for repowering, but I think the opportunity could be pretty substantial.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I think if you -- Julien, this is Brian. You heard me talk before. If you look at our PPA buyout strategy as particularly the ones who have been successful have been on the wind side where we bought them out and repowered them. So, I think a long-term extension of wind PTCs, even solar PTCs, new solar PTCs longer term, open up that PPA buyout opportunity or kind of just extend the runway for that longer term, right? We're obviously opportunistic, and you got to make it work for the customers and show a customer benefit and make it work from a financial perspective. But I think that's a longer-term opportunity that this reconciliation package in a 10-year extension of credit springs.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. And then I mean at risk of staying on the subject of reconciliation here, can you elaborate is there anything else that you all are looking at particularly closely and scrutinizing in terms of potential angles for you all specifically here? I mean, I know we talked about transmission a little bit ago, perhaps maybe elsewhere. What else are you seeing in that reconciliation bill that could really move the needle beyond the PTC in front of us?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think the bill lacks a lot of clarity. And our understanding even towards the goal line, we were putting in $100 billion or so of government infrastructure proposals that lack a lot of clarity from our side. But I see real opportunity in hydrogen, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, storage and transmission with potential development, and obviously with the potential for a nuclear production tax credit, you're talking about significant opportunities on the customer bill side as our plants run through the next decades we've applied for in the Minnesota resource plan. So, opportunities are out there. We really honestly, without a lot of clarity on the bills, lack some definition, but that's the stuff we're going to be working on through the course of the next couple of months, and then we'll have more clarity as we get more insight into the bill text.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, I appreciate your prepared remarks. But it sounds like -- just to clarify that, on the nuclear front, it sounds like you could potentially tap into that depending exactly on how it's framed here for your regulated assets.
Robert Frenzel: That's correct, yes.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, good to hear. All right. Well, I'll pass it on. Thank you guys very much.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks Julien.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Fleishman: Hey good morning. So, just I think, Brian, you said in your remarks that your equity needs could be lower if reconciliation passes. Could you explain that more?
Brian Van Abel: Yes absolutely, Steve. I said that could significantly be reduced if the current framework passes. Now it's still a little light on details in terms of what gets passed. But you see we have $1.2 billion of equity in our plan, and you could see that cut significantly down, right? The direct pay opportunity reduces, call it, the tax inefficiency and provides probably, call it, 75 to 100 basis points of improved cash flow. And so we look at that and what we can do from a financing perspective. It gives us a lot of opportunity to reduce those equity needs. So, we're pretty excited about the overall plan, really good from customers. And we look at that long-term tax credit extension and what that can do for our customers.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then I know this is also -- sorry, same topic. I know it's early, but the -- it looks like they've added the provision of a minimum corporate tax of 15% on larger companies like yours. And I think renewables credits are excluded from that, which is good, but I don't know if there might be other issues related to that for you. So, could you talk a little bit about how to think about that provision? And I think bonus went away with the Trump changes, but just thoughts on that issue and whether that could be a pressure?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So, it's a new regime, and we spent the last -- yesterday looking through the legislative tax and assessing that. And we think it's, for us, very manageable in terms of -- really it's -- the way it's qualified is a book alternative minimum tax, so different than the old AMT that existed. But overall, we feel comfortable with how it work and we can manage through it. And so when we look at the overall package, we view it as very positive for us. So, -- but again, like I said, it's a new regime and details will continue to come out, but that's our initial read on it.
Steve Fleishman: Great, that's very helpful. Last question, just high level, you obviously have the two big rate cases, Minnesota, Colorado. You've had a lot of success in regulatory for a while now. I guess the one thing that might be different today is just there are a lot of upward rate pressures. Those are decent-sized rate filings. There's fuel costs are rising and Uri and things like that. Just could you talk about does this make that different this time?
Robert Frenzel: Steve, it's Bob and thanks for the question. One of the key tenets of our strategy is affordability for our customers. You hear how resource planning will drive over the long-term, continued transitions in renewables that will drive customer bills relatively lower. We always work for ways to mitigate the customer impacts. These cases are largely capital cases under approved capital investment plans. And we have deferred -- at least in the Minnesota side, for over six years, we haven't had a case. And we've offered ways to mitigate some of the impacts of this case in particular. If you remember, we deferred cases throughout the pandemic and feel like we've been very judicious in watching our O&M expenses and trying to continue the investment plans that drive a clean energy transition, but ultimately end up in investing in capital that will ultimately need to get recovered. So, our plans, we've offered mitigation on interim rates. We think that the bill increases are manageable. I think under the proposal, we'd be down at about $1.25 a month for residential customers, so I think very manageable in total bill impacts. And so other areas we improve, we work hard on, if you think about our steel for fuel program and the success of adding wind in the Upper Midwest that -- we talked about this at the outset, but that addition of those megawatts has provided a natural gas hedge. We think we saved our customers over $300 million per year by having wind blowing instead of procuring natural gas on the margin. So, a very successful steel for fuel program, which doesn't necessarily show up, but it's mitigated bills over the last years and certainly with this uptick in natural gas pricing.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey good morning. Thank you for taking my question.
Robert Frenzel: Good morning.
Durgesh Chopra: You've answered, I guess, all the questions I had. Maybe just elaborate a little bit on the last point you made about natural gas prices? Obviously, you've had a ton of discussions with investors on that front. So perhaps your hedges, your gas assets how are they placed, impact on customer bills, anything that you can share with us?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So, really -- Bob's point was really around our own wind investments providing significant fuel reductions. And if we look at what the cost would have been had we not had those wind farms, it would have been a $300 million higher impact to our customers on a year-to-date basis this year. So that's really what Bob's point is. I think the broader question is around kind of how these higher commodity costs potentially impact our customers. And when we think about it on the electric side. I think we're really well positioned, right? Bob already made the point about our wind strategy, our steel for fuel strategy. But also look, right, natural gas is a relatively small portion of the overall customer bills on the electric side. And we also have length. And you look at in NSP and SPS, this is something that doesn't quite come through clearly, but we've had light this year and we can sell into the market. And we've provided over $300 million in market sales that we credit back to our customers and help offset some of those higher commodity costs. So, I think we're really well-positioned on the electric side and don't see a significant impact on our customers. On the LDC side, certainly, there's less you can do there, given that commodity costs are a higher portion of our customers' bill. But the -- on the -- going into the winter, right, we have physical storage. We have financial products. And so I think we're -- when we look at it for -- take Colorado for example, I think our forecast for an impact, the average impact on the residential customer bill is about $15 per month for this winter. So, we think it's manageable, but we obviously look for every opportunity we can to help mitigate these customer bill impacts.
Durgesh Chopra: Thanks. The $15. Did you 1-5 dollar per month, right?
Brian Van Abel: 1-5, yes, not 5-0.
Durgesh Chopra: Yes. So what would that be percentage-wise?
Brian Van Abel: It's about 20% over the -- in the winter months.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe a couple of housekeeping items, if I may. You guys are showing some equity needs in your financing plan for 2026. Can you give us some color on what shape and form those might come in as? And what should we expect in terms of timing?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I think we show -- we get about $450 million of equity through our dividend reinvestment benefits program. So, that's -- and then the other piece, we say $800 million, that's likely we do it through an at-the-market program, just through an ATM. We have flexibility over that five-year timeframe as we look at our capital needs.
Robert Frenzel: Sophie, if you're -- if you want for modeling purpose, you could kind of assume something ratable assuming -- again, assuming that the -- that could be significantly reduced through a direct pay program that could potentially be approved by the government by year end.
Sophie Karp: Got it. And then just overall, the CapEx is going higher, right? And so how should we think about the rate base growth in this scenario? And I can appreciate there's lots of puts and takes here with uncertainties with what the Washington is going to do. But in general, how should we think about that and the corresponding kind of regulatory lag and earnings growth with this new forecast? And if you guys are not prepared to talk about this now, like when do you think you will roll out those numbers?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. No, I think we're pretty excited about our new capital plan. I think we -- as Bob mentioned, it drives a lot of benefit for our customers. And it's -- based off of our kind of 2021 rate basis, it will afford us a 6.5% rate base growth for our five-year plan. And then if you look at that, call it, potential incremental capital that we need on the transmission system and some renewables that could come out of the resource plans, that could push north of 7%, to about 7.3% if we executed on that. And a lot of this, right, depending on the type of capital, it could be recovered through riders if it's transmission or renewables or built into our multiyear plan in Colorado. So, we're comfortable with the overall capital plan and have kind of plans in place to address the regulatory recovery of it.
Robert Frenzel: And Sophie, if you look at the slides we do detailed rate base growth by year. So, if you want to see that, you can check that out.
Sophie Karp: Got it. Thank you. And lastly, if I may, on Colorado. So, a pretty good outcome I guess with the settlement there on the fuel cost recovery. Should we think about potentially that opening the door on the settlement in the rate case you have there or is it too early to say?
Robert Frenzel: Well, I think you're hitting on one of the key points of the settlement. I mean we put four proceedings behind us as part of the settlement so that we could get to the more strategic conversation, Sophie. The power pathway and the resource plan are certainly right in front of us and ripe for fourth quarter conversations. And then as you mentioned, longer term the electric rate case in Colorado could also be in there. So, yes, I think what it says is we've got pathways to settlement in Colorado, we can reach constructive outcomes, we wanted to clear the underbrush a bit and get to the bigger and more strategic issues.
Sophie Karp: Thank you. I appreciate the comments. I'll jump back into the queue.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Travis.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Travis.
Travis Miller: I wanted to kind of build on the customer affordability and rate-making a little bit. If you look holistically across all the regulatory rate-making proposals and such that you have out there, and we put kind of buckets around those components of the allowed ROE or cost of capital, another bucket being operating cost recovery, another bucket being CapEx, where are you seeing the most pushback in terms of keeping customer bill affordable on that?
Brian Van Abel: I think ROE has always been, call it, an area of dispute in the rate case, right? So, I think that -- I don't think that's unique to us. I think that's pretty common across other utilities. That's one of the big levers that they look at in determining what the appropriate ROE is. Now, we feel pretty good that from where we stand, our ROEs that have been authorized over the past few years have been below the national average. So, when we think about ROE risk there, we think of more potential upside and getting closer to the national average, right, as we know we're leading the clean energy transition, helping our states lead with their policy goals. So, I think there's an opportunity there for us on the ROE side. Now, for us, I think we're pretty proud about our O&M story. Now, if you go all the way back to 2014 and look at where we are today, we're basically flat from an O&M perspective. So, we saved -- if you just apply the 2% inflation growth in that number, maybe several hundred millions of dollars that we've avoided and saved our customers annually. So, I think -- overall, I think we have a really clean story. Our cases are primarily capital-driven, investing in the needs of the system. So, I think overall -- obviously, you have sometimes just lumpy if you hadn't filed a case in six years, and it comes a big headline number. But we look forward to working with our parties and the commissions on working through these rate cases and really delivering a great product in the end.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Travis, it's Bob. Just one more thing to add on to what Brian said, which I completely agree with. We've got -- and I mentioned this earlier, we've got such a favorable renewables regime where we sit that we've been able to both mitigate commodity increases, whether that's coal or natural gas over time, deliver on our steel for fuel premise and drive the fuel component of customer bills down and provide sort of a mitigant in terms of volatility. And that provides real value both on the residential side. But when you talk to our industrial customers, stability and predictability is what they really want as they're making investments in their own business. And by being able to have a favorable regime for that, we can deliver renewables at significantly more beneficial cost than a lot of the country. And that's helped mitigate our total bills for all of our customer classes.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. I really appreciate it and you had answered all my other questions.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: Hey, good morning.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Paul.
Brian Van Abel: Good morning.
Paul Patterson: Just really quick clarification question on, I guess it's Jeremy. The just on a high level, that 1% sales growth -- and I realize that it's been shifting around and what have you. Of course, we've had COVID. But just going forward at 2022, just from my understanding, would you say that 1% is kind of what you see as being now a new normal number? Not so much between the classes of customers, just a general projection in 2023, et cetera. Do you think that that's sort of your new run rate in terms of sales growth?
Brian Van Abel: I think it might be looking beyond 2022. I think 2022, we're still starting to see still a little bit of a rebound from the depths of COVID. So, I don't know if that's a full 1%, probably between 0% and 1% on a longer five-year forecast. I think that's -- there's upside opportunities. I'll hedge when I give that number. There's upside opportunities, right, from electric vehicles. And we're just getting into the discussion of beneficial electrification. So, I think longer term, there's a lot of opportunities on the electric sales side. But I think for this front 5, you're probably talking in the 0% to 1% after 2022.
Paul Patterson: Okay, that's great. And then in terms of inflation, no change in that since we talked about it last quarter, so I don't want to go over it again. But unless there has been a change in your outlook, has there been any change or any new thoughts about it?
Brian Van Abel: No, but I mean I'm sure you read the same headlines as we all do with the near-term inflationary pressures. But no real changes from our commentary in Q2 as we think about it longer term.
Paul Patterson: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Verition. Please go ahead.
Ashar Khan: Hi, good morning. If I heard correctly in response to Steve's question you said that if this reconciliation bill passes and the direct payout provision, that you can eliminate most of your equity needs of $1.1 billion that you have in the plan. Is that accurate? I just want to reconcile.
Brian Van Abel: No, I said we could significantly reduce our equity needs.
Ashar Khan: Significantly. Okay, significantly is more than 50%?
Brian Van Abel: I think significantly is significantly. And we do -- we really have to see the details of this plan, right? It's a framework, and the details are light. So, once we get through all the nuts and bolts of it, we'll come back. Assuming it gets passed, which we are optimistic that it gets passed, we'll come back with the full details on it.
Ashar Khan: Okay, okay. So, but then if that significantly happens hopefully, then that should imply a higher growth rate because we have less dilution. Is that -- would that be a reasonable assumption, one leading to the other?
Brian Van Abel: There are some puts and takes. You could see a little bit lower rate base growth depending on the details of it. So, there's puts and takes, but I think overall, we're positive about where the reconciliation package stands, both for our customers and for us as a company.
Ashar Khan: As -- okay, as shareholders. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions. at this time. I'd like to turn the conference to CFO, Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. With any questions, please contact our Investor Relations team.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Paul Johnson: Thanks Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we will review our 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on compatible GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. In addition, please note this is Ben Fowke's last earnings call. He will retire as CEO in August but will continue as Executive Chair of the Board. Ben has been an outstanding CEO and will be missed. I'll now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you, Paul and good morning everybody. Before we dive into quarterly results, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize Ben and thank him for his leadership. He's been a leader at Xcel Energy for two decades as Treasurer, CFO, President, and Chief Operating Officer, and then CEO and Chairman of the Board. And since he assumed the CEO role in 2011, we've been a national leader in reliability, customer service and safety, all hallmarks of excellent utility operations, and our operational performance has improved over that period. For example, we transformed our nuclear plants into one of the top-ranked fleets in the nation, while lowering our cost structure by 20%. And under Ben's leadership, we delivered for the environment, became a national leader in wind energy and highlighted by our steel for fuel strategy. We've tripled our total wind capacity from 3,400 megawatts to over 10,000 megawatts and our owned wind growing from 300 megawatts to more than 4,000 megawatts. We've significantly reduced the level of coal in our fuel mix from 50% to 21%, and we reduced our carbon emissions by 51% compared to our 2005 baseline. We were the first major U.S. utility to establish 100% carbon-free goal while remaining a stalwart champion for reliability and affordability. We've delivered excellence for our financial stakeholders as well. We've tripled Xcel Energy's market cap from $12 billion to $37 billion, and our stock prices increased from $24 per share to almost $70 per share, reflecting a TSR of 300% and outpacing our peer group. We've met or exceeded our earnings guidance every year and increased our dividend in line with our earnings growth. And beyond Xcel Energy, Ben's recently served as Chairman of EEI, leading through pandemic uncertainties, driving focus on the need for increased levels of research and development for new technologies and inspiring his peers to define diversity and inclusion priorities for their organizations. He's had a tremendous run as CEO and will leave a lasting legacy at Xcel Energy, for the utility industry, and I would go so far as to say for the country. So thank you, Ben. And congratulations on your upcoming retirement in August. I look forward to your continued leadership at the Board level and partnering with you on important federal policy efforts related to infrastructure and clean energy. Looking ahead and I'm honored with the opportunity to lead this great company, and I recognize the Lebron James-sized shoes that I'm filling. Since joining Xcel Energy five years ago, Ben and I have worked closely on the development and the execution of our strategy, and that will not change. We'll continue to lead the clean energy transition, enhance our customers' experience and will constantly work to keep our customers bill low and deliver an affordable product. We've had a fantastic leadership team and significant bench strength, and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in front of us while maintaining our commitment to reliability and affordability. I'm excited about our growth opportunities over the next decade, driven by our generation resource plans, transmission expansion, distribution investments and our electric vehicle vision. As we move forward, innovation is more critical than ever as we prepare to move from 80% carbon reduction by 2030 to 100% carbon-free electricity. I'll be focused on clean technologies in both our electric and our natural gas businesses as well as how we engage with customers in new ways through a more flexible grid. I also expect innovative work practices will continue to drive efficiency and produce strong operational results. And safety is another area where I plan to help drive innovation. As one of our core values, safety is already a priority, but we can do even better. I want us to move beyond traditional metrics and embrace a heightened focus on prevention and culture change, eliminating the most serious events by encouraging trust, transparency, and learning. In the coming months, I look forward to continued engagement with our customers, our communities, our regulators, our investors and of course, our workforce. We have the best employees in the business, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited for the future successes that we'll achieve together. And to our investors, we appreciate the trust that you place in us, and we'll continue to be good stewards of your investments. Now, turning to the quarter. Today, we reported solid quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share compared to $0.54 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance. We made significant progress on various regulatory initiatives, including three constructive rate case settlements that Brian will discuss in more detail. In addition, we've advanced our plans for adding incremental renewables. In Wisconsin, the commission approved our proposal for the 74-megawatt Mustang solar project for $100 million, which will be the largest solar facility in Western Wisconsin. In June, the Minnesota Commission approved our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA for $210 million from ALLETE. This repowered project will save our customers money while extending the life of a renewable energy resource. And the Minnesota Commission continues to evaluate our $575 million proposal to build a 460-megawatt solar facility, takes advantage of existing transmission as we phase out of coal. We are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits and expect a decision later this year or early in Q1 of next year. Additionally, as part of our continued commitment to foster a skilled and diverse workforce, we proposed a training program in Minnesota to help those in underrepresented communities develop the skills to succeed in energy-related construction careers. Program graduates will have the opportunity to be considered for participation in our Sherco solar proposal and other future projects. In June, we filed an alternative Minnesota resource plan, which achieves an 85% carbon reduction by 2030. This proposal addresses the concerns of various parties by removing the Sherco combined cycle from consideration and replacing it with two combustion turbines. The key components of the revised plan include an early retirement of both the King and the Sherco three coal units in 2028 and 2030, respectively; a life extension for our Monticello nuclear plant; construction of new transmission lines in order to take advantage of the interconnection rights from the retiring coal units; and the addition of 3,150 megawatts of universal solar, 2,650 megawatts of wind, 800 megawatts of new hydrogen-ready CTs and 300 megawatts of repowered blackstart CTs, 1,900 megawatts of flexible peaking resources and 250 megawatts of new storage. We've provided the commission with an outstanding resource plan that will reduce carbon while maintaining reliability and customer affordability. We expect a decision on the Minnesota resource plan later this year or early next. In addition, we continue to make good progress and are in the discovery phase of the Colorado resource plan and associated transmission power pathway project. We expect the commission decision on both proposals in early 2022. And between Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of new renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. 
Brian Van Abel: Thanks Bob and good morning everyone. We had a good second quarter, recording $0.58 per share compared with $0.54 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.19 per share, primarily driven by riders and regulatory outcomes to recover our capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment programs; increased O&M expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share; and lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, largely due to placing several large wind farms into service last year. Turning to sales, weather-normalized electric sales increased by 5.3% in the second quarter. This reflects a comparison to last year when the pandemic restrictions in our states were at their highest levels, and our sales were most suppressed due to COVID impacts. Our year-to-date weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 1.6%. We continue to anticipate modest annual weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased $50 million for the quarter, which largely reflects the timing of expenses between the two periods. Last year, we had significant O&M reductions in the second and third quarter to offset the impact of lower sales from COVID, while the fourth quarter was at higher levels. So, the quarterly O&M comparisons will be chunky this year. Turning to regulatory filings, we reached constructive settlements in three rate cases. In Wisconsin, we agreed to a rate increase of $66 million over 2022 to 2023 based on an ROE of 9.8% in 2022, 10.0% in 2023 and an equity ratio of 52.5%. In New Mexico, we agreed to a rate increase of $62 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.35% and an equity ratio of 54.7%. We also accelerated the depreciation life of our Tolk coal plant to 2032 as we plan for its early retirement. In North Dakota, we agreed to a rate increase of $7 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. We anticipate commission decisions in these cases later this year. In July, we filed a Colorado electric rate case, seeking a net rate increase of $343 million based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55.6% and the 2022 forecast test year. The rate case is largely driven by capital investment, and we anticipate a commission decision in the spring of 2022. We also have a pending Texas electric rate case. We're seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. The request is driven by capital investment and is based on an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. Commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 for the surcharge back to March 2021. As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022. We also plan to file a Minnesota natural gas case later this year. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We received commission approval for the Mustang solar project and the ALLETE wind PPA repowering buyout. We provided an alternative to our Minnesota resource plan, which will deliver 85% carbon reduction by 2030, provide transparency into our long-term opportunities. We reached constructive rate case settlements in Wisconsin, New Mexico and North Dakota. We filed our Colorado electric rate case. We reaffirmed our 2021 guidance range. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth in our 5% to 7% objective range. Now, before we open up for questions, I'll turn it over to Ben for some closing comments.
Ben Fowke: Well, thanks Brian and good morning everyone. It's really been an amazing decade as CEO, and before that, as CFO. I'm really proud of the tremendous accomplishments we made as a company. I'm extremely proud of the incredible efforts and contributions our employees make in serving our customers and our local communities. I've also really enjoyed the interactions I've had with our investors and the financial community. I appreciate your interest in the company, your feedback and your suggestions, I'm going to miss that. Now it's really hard to retire from a role that I've truly enjoyed, but I'm leaving the company in great hands. I know that Bob, Brian and the rest of the management team will continue to do an outstanding job leading Xcel Energy well into the future. I also plan on attending EEI this fall. And I look forward to seeing a lot of you there. So, thank you all. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi good morning. Ben, congratulations and best of luck moving forward.
Ben Fowke: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to start off, I guess, with the renewables. And if you could expand, I guess, on how the pipeline looks for incremental renewables after that Sherco and wind repowering? And also, I guess, how local stimulus efforts might influence this going forward?
Robert Frenzel: Hey Jeremy, good morning. It's Bob and thanks for the note this morning. Yes, we filed resource plans in both Colorado and in Minnesota. And as we work through those proceedings, I'd say by first quarter next year, we'll have real visibility into the outcomes of both of those. And we'll move forward with what we'll call resource acquisition plans where we propose projects, and we solicit input from others for projects that are coming. I think if your question is around where we are in the R&R recovery plan in Minnesota, in particular, the four wind repowerings were approved in December. The ALLETE repowering project was just approved in June, and we still have the Sherco solar project that is proposed that we hope for approval by end of this year or maybe early next.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just pivoting over to Uri, if we could. Just want to see the early stages of your Winter Storm Uri recovery proceedings, how they're progressing, and what changes, if any, do you expect operationally going forward?
Robert Frenzel: Sure. So, we have approvals in, I think, four of our states at this point, and we're still working through proceedings in three others. I think the largest of those is both Minnesota and Colorado. We're still working through the proceedings on as well as Texas. Our expectation is we acted in accordance with all of our regulatory regulations, prior policies and procedures. And so we do expect a full recovery of our incurred costs on Winter Storm Uri. Yes, I think looking forward, Colorado has opened a docket to explore alternate mechanisms for us and others in the state to look at, and they've proposed an alternative. We've commented it's a NOPR, so they're looking for inputs, and we've commented to the NOPR. And we expect some resolution and some hearings in that process in the third or fourth quarter of this year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Securities. 
Robert Frenzel: Hey Julien, good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning and congrats, Ben. It's been a pleasure. I will see you soon. I'm sure.
Ben Fowke: Thanks.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But if I can -- absolutely. I look forward to seeing you at EEI. If I can pivot to the transmission side in brief here, you all talked previously about this Colorado being potentially expanded over time. Obviously, you're looking for the first phase here to be approved, as you talked about in the prepared remarks. But can you talk about subsequent co-ownership partners and just ultimately, expansion of what you guys have underway here, if there's been any progress?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Certainly happy to. But before I get started, I actually I think the congratulations are in order for you and [indiscernible] and look forward to your pending next year. So, congrats.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you so much. I sincerely appreciate that.
Robert Frenzel: On transmission, in particular, in Colorado, we put forward what we think is a pretty progressive plan, Julien. Historically, we'd have generation be put forward first and then you'd follow-up with the transmission that's necessary. I think where we are and certainly in Colorado and where I think a lot of the country is actually is, is we need to build a substantial amount of transmission to relieve congestion to enable the renewables that we see are necessary to complete this clean energy transition. So, in Colorado, we've put forth what we call the power pathway. That's largely, I'll call it, a super highway of transmission lines through the Eastern Plains of Colorado to connect the good solar and wind resources of the Eastern half of Colorado with the load centers, predominantly in Denver and in the I-25 corridor. So, that path, along with the Colorado resource plan, are progressing in parallel, two separate dockets but in parallel. We expect resolution on both of them by late this year, probably early next year. And your comment on -- we've got a base plan, and I call that sort of we're going to build the freeway. But we also have to build the on and offramps and things like that. So, while the base plan for the freeway itself, I think, is about -- and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere in the $1.7-ish billion range. But we need to build voltage and VAR stability. We need to build -- once we find out exactly where the generation resources are going to exist, then we need to build support along that freeway for how those transmissions will integrate with the broader bulk electric system. And that's sort of where that incremental and variation in sort of the base plan versus the other things that we'll need to do once we identify exactly where the resources are. So, like I just mentioned to Jeremy, we'll conclude the phase one of the resource plan in Q1 of next year. At that point, we'll go into resource acquisition. And that's where we picked the resource in exact locations, and then we can have a better, more granular answer to your question on what's the total pathway cost above and beyond sort of the base system. Does that make sense?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, totally. I get it. Excellent. And if I can pivot to a slightly related question, if you don't mind. What are you seeing in terms of the impacts across your portfolio here vis-à-vis inflation, cost structure, logistics? Just as you guys look at your renewable build here and perhaps just some of the timing on, for instance, Sherco here? Perhaps not necessarily related, but just as you think about some of those decision-making truths.
Brian Van Abel: Hey Julien, it's Brian. Good to hear from you. Yes. Certainly, we're seeing inflation. If you're just looking at the headlines, right, we're not immune to some of the headlines that everyone is seeing. For us, it's inflationary pressures of commodities such as steel, copper and labor. But really, we think it's transitory in nature. And I think really, it's -- I think we found that it was pretty easy to shut down the economy, and it's a lot more challenging to restart the economy from the supply chain and the demand that has followed the shutdown of the economy, something that we are focused on and proactively managing from a supply chain perspective. So, I don't see any significant impacts as we sit here today. Now, specifically, if I want to touch on a couple of the major projects we have in flight. Now, the four wind repowerings that we have, we feel really good about those in Minnesota. Now, those are partial repowerings, so I think blades in the inside of the nacelles. We're not replacing the steel towers. We're not facing steel price risk there. And so we don't really face any significant inflationary pressures on those. So, feel good about that. The large-scale solar farm that we have in front of the Minnesota commission, I'm sure everyone is aware of the solar panel pricing that has been increasing this year. But we look at that. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of construction and when we place that in service in terms of what year. So, we feel really good about that project, too. So overall, something we're certainly focused on and watching but don't see any real impacts as we sit here today. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. And just to clarify from your guide here, the shift in O&M is offset by the gas sales? Just some more nuance there for 2021.
Robert Frenzel: The shift, I would say, gas sales, certainly good to see an uptick in gas sales from 0% to 1%. But if you remember, gas is a pretty small piece of our business, so a 1% change in gas margins is about $4 million. So, I wouldn't say it necessarily fully offsets it.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, fair enough. Hey thanks again guys. We'll see you soon.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ryan Levine from Citi.
Ryan Levine: Thank you. A couple of questions, one on transmission to follow-up on some of those points. It looks like in your presentation, you highlight $300 million of CPCN for that project. It looked like previously, there was a $250 million number that was out there for the May Valley-Longhorn expansion. Are you seeing cost inflation on that particular project? Or is there another dynamic that may cause the change in number?
Robert Frenzel: No. Look, I think we're still in very early innings on sort of exact routings and pathways. I wouldn't read too much into that, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: Okay. I mean, are there a lot of different pathways that you're -- no pun intended, around the way that, that project can get built out? Or is it fairly visible from your mind in terms of how the project will be contracted?
Robert Frenzel: Well, look, I think we haven't gone through local permitting. We've got a lot of just local land processes we'll have to go through. So, -- and we're early stages in engineering of that project. I think we felt it was really important to make sure that the transmission and the generation proceeded in parallel. And so I think that as we go through time, as we get better engineering, as we get better insight into the land processes, those routes will be very specific. There's still a pretty big range of capital expenditures for that. A lot of it's based on final routing and final land approval costs. So, I guess then, I wouldn't read too much into that particular leg extension.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then lastly, in terms of some of the recent legislation in Colorado pertaining to gas, are you anticipating any material impact to your business around some of the recent SB21-246 and the 1238 and 1286 and some of the others that have recently passed?
Robert Frenzel: Can you repeat those again, Ryan? That's quite a litany of bill numbers. Let me just -- I'll talk a little bit about the clean heat plan in Colorado and maybe even to a parallel path, the innovative gas act that was also approved here in Minnesota. Look, I think both of those bills recognize that we're in early innings of lowering our customers' emissions from the gas LDC businesses and not dissimilar to what we went through in the mid-90s with renewables. I mean, the technology is nascent and the solutions are relatively expensive. But we also recognize we need to start somewhere. And so I think that the legislation in both places recognize those facts. And look, we are -- we'll do pilots. We'll introduce technology. We'll look at beneficial electrification and energy efficiency programs, all tools that maybe aren't readily available under the current regulation schemes today. But these pieces of legislation allow for some of that innovation to happen on the gas LDC side. I think the legislation also recognizes it's really important to respect the reliability and affordability. And I think each state addressed it slightly differently. But there's a cap in Colorado and regulatory approval for plans. And in Minnesota, similarly, their regulatory approval for the pilots, that makes sure that they're cost-justified and beneficial for our customers as well as we think about lowering their emissions profile from the gas LDC business. So, we're -- we were very active in both of those pieces of legislation, and we are working with the regulatory agencies to look at how we write the regulations for those pieces of legislation. And then we'll be active as we put proposals forward to help our customers reduce their footprint emissions profile in each state. So, yes, I think there's opportunity here, and we're going to continue to work with our commissions and our stakeholders.
Ryan Levine: I appreciate it.
Robert Frenzel: You bet.
Operator: And it looks like we have a question from David Peters from Wolfe Research.
David Peters: Hey good morning. I echo the congrats to Ben. Just one question for me. As you guys make progress working through your IRPs in Colorado and Minnesota and then the transmission opportunities as well, it just seems like there's a lot of incremental capex opportunities above some of the more basic blocking and tackling. Just how would you kind of characterize that within the context of the kind of 5% to 7% growth targets you've targeted here recently?
Robert Frenzel: Hey David, thanks for the question. This is Bob. I guess similar to Julien I might have to start with congratulations to you for your recent [indiscernible] yourself. So, we have two of those on the call today.
David Peters: Thank you.
Robert Frenzel: In terms of incremental capital, yes, I think there's some projects still out there that we're working through regulatory processes on, the largest of which is the Sherco solar, which we talked about. I think longer term, we've got base proposals on our resource plans and for our transmission planning. Stuff that's not included in the near-term is obviously MISO and SPP transmission expansion plans, and those are generally outside of our five-year forecast but definitely in sort of a 10-year vision forecast. And then we expect our base -- rate base growth plan to be right around 7%. And so any incremental -- and I think there's a couple of incremental projects that could take us above that. I think we'd expect to keep our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate, and we can reevaluate that regularly, and we do. But I think right now, we're just comfortable with being at the high end of our guidance range.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And Dave, I'd just add to that. I think what you hear from us, what we're really focused on doing is providing our investors with that long-term transparency as we work through our resource plans in Minnesota and Colorado this year, looking at almost 10 gigawatts renewables by 2030 between those two. Plus the associated transmission that comes in Colorado and what we could expect to see out of MISO here is giving investors that transparency into extending and really feeling good about the long-term growth rate, not through this five but through -- and talk about it through the decade, so something we're focused on.
David Peters: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: And we have a question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.
Robert Frenzel: Hey good morning Paul.
Paul Patterson: Hey good morning. Congratulations Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thanks so much.
Paul Patterson: Absolutely. So, just -- there have been some comments out of Colorado from some of the commissioners regarding rates and sort of the cumulative impact, et cetera. And you mentioned on the call, I think, that you don't see any significant -- you think that the inflation issues that we have currently are sort of transitory. But I'm wondering, in terms of your goals, and I think there's pretty much to be -- somewhat below the rate of inflation. Are we still on track with that with respect to your outlook in the various jurisdictions? Has there been any change in that because of the transitory impact or anything else that we should think about?
Robert Frenzel: Paul, it's Bob, and I'll let Brian chime in if I miss anything. But in particular, with respect to Colorado, I think that our customers' bills in Colorado are about a third, 35% less than the national average and have been basically flat for the past five years. And although we filed a rate case out there, we expect even after the rate case, they're still going to be 25% below the national average.
Brian Van Abel: If we got everything we asked for.
Robert Frenzel: Yes, if we got everything in the case that we asked for, they'll still be 25% below the national average. But your longer-term question is, do we think we continue this transition to a cleaner energy economy cost affordably. And the answer to that is yes. And the impacts that we're seeing for inflation, we would say, are still relatively transitory. I think some of the macro economists would sort of agree with that comment. We think that we can transition our states at less than the rate of inflation over the next 10 years to an 80% carbon reduction. Colorado, in particular, will be 85% carbon reduction, less than the cost of inflation. So, I think our strategic thesis holds, and we don't see this current spat of restarting the economy as derailing our longer term plans.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. And I would say, you see that in our resource plans, right, where we kind of show the bill impacts over the next decade in both Colorado and Minnesota. And we do -- we run those resource plans in the cases we put forward to the commission with current tax policy. And there's a lot of discussion in D.C. about a long-term extension of federal tax credits around clean energy, and we certainly support -- fully support Senator Wyden's Clean Energy for America Act. And when we run that analysis, that's really good for our customers in terms of those extension of credits. It only brings down the cost as we make this transition.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And just your long-term -- just for -- obviously, it could change, but your long-term inflation expectations are around 2% still. Is that about right?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, longer term.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much guys.
Robert Frenzel: You bet.
Operator: And we have a question from Ashar Khan with Verition.
Ashar Khan: Ben, I just wanted to dial in to congratulate you. Known you for a long time, and the company did wonderfully well and hope Bob can continue in that spate. So, congrats again. And if I can ask one industry question. I know you've been heading the EEI and trying to get the nuclear PTCs across the board in the legislative front. Could you give us any update where we stand on that endeavor?
Ben Fowke: Well, it will likely be part of the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation process. And there's a lot of moving parts with that. The first part of that will be just getting the budget resolutions to the various committees. And that will establish how much funding those committees have to pursue broad topics, which we believe will ultimately include the nuclear PTC. We like to see that in August. And then, of course, the actual legislation would take place in the fall. Again, there's a lot of moving parts. As you know, it's a 50-50 Senate and a very narrow margin in the house. So, it's a balancing act. But we are definitely advocating for that. We're advocating, as Brian mentioned, Senator Wyden's bill. We think direct pay, PTC for solar, these are things that are going to really help the clean energy transition to be affordable for our customers and the industry in general. And I look forward to seeing you perhaps at EEI.
Ashar Khan: Certainly. Thank you so much.
Ben Fowke: You got it.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to Brian Van Abel, CFO.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thanks all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Thanks everyone.
Operator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2021 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.  This morning, we will review our '21 -- 2021 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. There are slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.  Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the compatible -- comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.  With that, I'll turn it over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $0.67 per share compared with $0.56 per share last year. We're off to a good start, and we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range. But I want to start out by thanking our employees for their outstanding work to ensure that our customers did not experience any material outages during Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of our strong performance of our power plants, and our electric and natural gas systems during that serious event. I think there are a lot of lessons learned from Uri, the need to invest in resiliency, the increased interdependency between the gas and electric sectors and the need to have 24/7 dispatchable generation available are a few that come to mind.  So despite strong operational performance, we incurred $1 billion of incremental fuel costs during the winter storm. It's important to recognize that we followed all the policies and procedures regarding natural gas purchasing and hedging as approved by regulators in our states. We're in the process of seeking recovery for incremental fuel cost and we'll propose to defer the cost recovery over 1 year or 2 to mitigate the impact on our customers.  Well turning to our investment plans. In February, we filed our proposal to buy out a repowered 120-megawatt wind PPA from ALLETE for $210 million. The buyout will save our customers money while extending the life of our renewable energy resource. We also filed our proposal to build 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant for an estimated investment of $575 million. The project takes advantage of existing transmission and will bring good, high-paying local construction jobs to our economy.  We requested a commission decision on both projects later this year and are confident the commission will see the customer and economic benefits. In March, we filed our resource plan in Colorado, which details our plans to reduce carbon emissions by 85% and increase renewables to 80% of our fuel mix by 2030. The plan includes the early retirement of 2 coal units at Hayden in 2027 and 2028, the conversion of Pawnee to natural gas in 2028, the early retirement of Comanche 3 in 2040 with reduced operations beginning in 2030. Now under the plan, we will add 2,300 megawatts of wind, 1,600 megawatts of universal scale solar, 400 megawatts of storage, 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources and 1,200 megawatts of distributed solar resources through our renewable energy programs.  In addition, we are continuing to make progress on the Minnesota resource plan and expect a decision later this year. Between the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans, we anticipate adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of renewables to our system to meet our 80% carbon reduction goal by 2030. We also filed our pathway transmission expansion plan in Colorado. The proposal request approval to build 560 miles of 345 kV transmission lines creating a backbone that will enable 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewables and help Colorado achieve its 2030 carbon reduction goals. The estimated cost of the backbone is $1.7 billion, with an incremental investment of up to $1 billion for network upgrades, voltage support and addition transmission line and interconnection work. We expect decisions on the Colorado pathway project later this year.  Turning to the NSP system. MISO recently presented its long-range transmission planning roadmap, which identified potential scenarios for future system development based on constrained areas and options for regional transmission expansion. This conceptional roadmap highlighted an initial set of projects in the MISO footprint, which could drive $30 billion of investment and a full rollout could result in up to $100 billion of investment. While this is very preliminary, a high level conceptual framework, it does highlight the need for significant transmission over the next 15 years. The transmission expansion and resource plans will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of this decade.  Now as you know, one of my highest priorities is ensuring Xcel Energy is a positive force for racial justice and reconciliation. We are deeply committed to supporting our communities in advancing racial equity, rebuilding following civil unrest and addressing COVID-19 impacts, which continue to disproportionately affect black communities. I'm proud that our company is engaged in a community dialogue and we are investing in organizations that are having a real impact. We've got more work to do as a company, a community, and a country towards creating a more just society. But by working together, we can all be part of the solution.  We're also proud of the recognition we're receiving for our actions. For example, Xcel Energy was named among the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine for the eighth consecutive year, ranking second among gas and electric companies. And we continue to be cited as a top company for LGBTQ equality, earning a perfect score in the human rights campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality designation for the fifth consecutive year.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a good start to the year, booking $0.67 per share compared to $0.56 per share last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes to recover our capital investments and increase margin from our small trading operation, reflecting higher market prices. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. As a reminder, though, production tax credits lower the ETR. PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral.  Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense which reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Lower AFUDC decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to placing several larger wind farms into service last year. In addition, other items combined to decrease earnings by $0.02 per share.  Turning to sales. Weather and leap year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.9% in the first quarter. Our sales forecast assumed that there was a lingering impact from COVID-19, and we expected a slight decline in Q1. However, the adverse impacts of COVID on sales were largely felt starting in the second quarter of last year. As a result, we anticipate a positive quarter-over-quarter sales comparison next quarter. And for the year, we continue to anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1%. Shifting to expenses. O&M increased slightly for the quarter. We expect annual O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for new wind farms, offset by a decline in base O&M.  Now turning to our regulatory filings. In January, we filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision and implementation of final rates are anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. In February, we filed a Texas electric rate case seeking a net rate increase of $74 million after reflecting fuel savings and PTCs from the Sagamore wind farm. A commission decision is expected in the first quarter of 2022 with a surcharge back to March 2021.  The Texas and New Mexico rate cases are driven by the Sagamore wind farm, investment in transmission and distribution due to significant growth, the loss of a wholesale customer, changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our coal plant, a requested ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.6%. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $19 million based on a requested ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January and the decision is expected later this year.  As far as future filings go, we anticipate filing a Colorado electric rate case this summer with rates going into effect in the first half of 2022. We are working with parties to reach settlement agreements regarding our plans for Wisconsin rate case. And finally, we also anticipate filing a Minnesota electric rate case in November, with interim rates going into effect in January of 2022.  Shifting to renewables. We continue to achieve important milestones in our PPA buyout strategy. In March, we closed on the acquisition of the 99-megawatt repowered Mower wind farm. We expect Mower will provide significant customer savings in carbon reduction for our customers. We've gotten off to a great start for the year and are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share. We've updated our guidance assumptions, and we expect incremental interest expense due to the lag in recovery of the $1 billion of unplanned fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri. As we work with our commissions to recover the fuel costs, we're not seeking to recover the carrying costs from our customers, as we help to manage the overall bill impacts. We continue to expect to deliver earnings around the midpoint of the guidance range.  With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to execute on our PPA buyout strategy with the acquisition of the Mower wind farm and filing of the elite PPA repowering buyout. We filed our solar proposal in Minnesota. We filed our Colorado resource plan and transmission expansion plan, which will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities and will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We reaffirmed our guidance range and finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will begin with Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: I was just wondering, how does your Colorado generation transition impact transmission needs overall? Given the national attention on transmission, currently, what type of receptivity do you expect to this proposal? And are there similar investments you're evaluating across the rest of your footprint?
Ben Fowke: Well, yes, I mean, I think the response has been very favorable. And I think there's a recognition that if we're going to achieve, in the case of Colorado, an 85% carbon reduction with almost 80% of it coming from renewable energy, that we're going to need a strong backbone to be able to do that. And Jeremy, when you factor in the price of all that, it still comes out in an incredibly affordable price point for our customers, which quite frankly, might be made all the more affordable with some of the policies that are coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan.  If you think about it, if we -- if the extension of PTCs, the direct refundability, the normalization opt-out for solar, an ITC for transmission, that promises to make our plan, which, of course, includes 10,000 megawatts of renewables, that much more affordable for our customers. And when you keep your product affordable, you create headroom for additional investments in the grid, like the transmission you're referring to. So I'm really optimistic that we've got a tremendous opportunity in front of us with transmission aided by the policies that I mentioned that will keep the price point low. And that's in all of our regions. The MISO studies are preliminary, but I think you can see that, that's an enormous investment opportunity. And hopefully, the slides we've attached for you are helpful in demonstrating where some of that build could happen.
Jeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And you outlined a lot of great CapEx opportunities out there over a long period of time. And just wondering how we should think about this CapEx as you laid it out there. As it relates to your growth rates, do you see this kind of firming up the 5% to 7% over a longer time period? Or do you think that there could be upside at some point? Just wondering how this all kind of comes together in your mind.
Ben Fowke: Well, we firmly believe we can be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. The things I'm describing only are helpful for that. But I mean you made a great point. When we talk about a long-term growth rate, we're not talking about 3 to 5 years, we're talking about a long time. So I'm quite confident that the opportunities we have in front of us will give you -- should give you comfort that we've got transparent plans to hit that. And again, we believe that we can be in the upper range of that range, upper half, right.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Just one last one, if I could. If you could speak to recent sales trends across territories, particularly SPS and how do you see reopening trends impacting sales over the balance of the year here?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Jeremy. Yes, good question. I think from a -- we talk about -- I'll talk about SPS specifically, when we talk about a little bit broader. We're in touch with our major customers in the oil patch area, and I would say they're cautiously optimistic. And we monitor some of our substations that serve those loads specifically, and they're reaching pre-pandemic levels. So that's a good sign. We're also hearing from them that there's a -- from the oil majors, that there's a big focus on electrifying rigs and pumps as they look at ways they can improve their carbon footprint.  So I would say, optimistic with what we're hearing down there. Overall, I think our territories, we're starting to come out of the COVID restrictions. And we have no restrictions in the Dakotas in Wisconsin and Texas, and Minnesota and Colorado are starting to ease up. In Minnesota here, we're at about a 75% capacity for bars and restaurants. So we look at all the leading indicators in our economies. And I would say there's positive growth in signs for this year. And I think we feel pretty good about our 1% year-over-year sales growth on the electric side.
Operator: We will now hear from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: So thinking more on transmission, just building on some of the prior questions. Just you laid out in MISO some potential additional growth. And I was just curious if you could just talk a little bit about the sort of the process steps in MISO from here. How will this develop over time? How might this impact your thinking and your CapEx over time?
Robert Frenzel: Stephen, it's Bob here. Good to hear from you. Look, with MISO and their MTEP21 plan, we expect all transmission owners to work through the process at MISO over the course of 2021. Ultimately, with a goal of by the end of the year, coming out with a series of recommended projects all over the territory. Obviously, being one of the largest TOs in MISO, transmission owners, we'd expect a lot of those projects to be in our service territory areas, particularly since those are the high-density renewable areas in the territories as well. So that goes forward.  Those projects are generally long-dated items, and we don't have capital for new major transmission lines in MISO in our 5-year forecast. But when Ben talks about the elongation of our growth and the investment that this industry needs to make the clean energy transition, we see that as the back half of the decade that's going to perpetuate the growth profile that we shared earlier.
Ben Fowke: Stephen, I'd just add that -- I would just add that the throttle has always been the cost to the consumer. And as I mentioned to a question earlier, we already had an affordable plan. I mean, taking advantage of very low-cost renewables, which even with transmission build, that still is great for our customers. You make that even less expensive, more affordable with the tax policies that are -- that I think have a pretty good shot of getting passed. And that's creating a lot of headroom for our investment, while keeping our product affordable, allowing us to then focus on things like electrification, which is also going to get ramped up with -- under the Biden administration proposal. It really is, I think, very, very bullish for Xcel Energy and great for our customers. I'm really excited about it.
Stephen Byrd: Bob, you were saying...
Robert Frenzel: Add one more opportunity, right? And on the SPP side, while they haven't been as outspoken and probably aren't as long as the process, as Ben mentioned earlier, that region of the country is renewables rich, has the opportunity to be an energy exporter to the country, and that's going to need transmission investment. So we think the MISO studies will provide some, I'll call it, no regrets projects early. But MISO and SPP also are going to have a lot more longer-dated capital projects to enable the resource-rich regions of this country to export to either the East or the West Coast. And we have a lot of ROFRs in place. So that's the other thing. We really -- we have right of first refusals, as you probably know, in some of our key states. So excited about it. Yes.
Stephen Byrd: So adding these together, I guess, if the combination of it, you get federal support in the form of an extension of tax credits for wind and solar, maybe new storage tax credit. That really helps reduce the cost in the second half of the decade anyway because you already have kind of a visibility on those tax credits in the first half, and that lines up with potentially, for example, more transmission spending in place like MISO so that could kind of work together.
Robert Frenzel: Yes, I mean, I think we had some pretty conservative numbers in our resource plans on how -- what the price point would be by 2030, and it's very affordable. Now if you have this, it becomes that much more affordable, creating the headroom to, again, make those investments in the grid that we'll be able to do and keep our product affordable, which opens up electrification opportunities in other sectors.
Stephen Byrd: That's really helpful. One just follow-up. You've -- in your resource plans, you've often talked about sort of the role of energy storage versus the role of peaking generation. You've raised a lot of good points about storage has a kind of limited duration, and you really do need peaking generation to ride through extended periods where renewables output might be low, for example. But I was just curious, as you think about the evolution of cost for storage, the potential for a federal tax credit for storage, would that sort of tip the balance a little bit more towards storage, a little bit less peaking? Or how are you all thinking about sort of the trade-offs between the two technologies?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think it's one of the reasons why, for example, in the Colorado resource plan, we -- I think we called for 1,300 megawatts of flexible resources. That's in addition to identified 400 megawatts of storage. So we'll let the economics aside, if it's gas or if it's batteries. That said, there are still going to be limitations to how much you can rely on batteries for longer term durations, like Winter Storm Uri. You need more than 4-hour battery storage or even 8 hours. But to the extent that it becomes affordable, I mean, we will definitely have more batteries on our system.
Robert Frenzel: Stephen, there's legislation in Colorado that's moving around innovative technology for pilot programs on dispatchable, zero-carbon assets, long duration storage, and any one of those can solve the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Right now, we look at what's available in the market, and that's short duration storage, 4, 8 hour stuff or gas CTs, but you might find a hydrogen fired opportunity or a long-dated energy storage opportunity that comes out of work -- that we're working on with EEI and other organizations over the next decade. So we can be flexible at this point. We don't have to build that stuff today. But over time, we're betting with technology, not against it.
Operator: Now we'll take a question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.
Durgesh Chopra: I just wanted to clarify one thing, Brian. On the 2021 guidance slide, the lower depreciation expense, I think you explained it well, but just so I have it correct. So essentially you're deferring the depreciation expense on the balance sheet. And that's what's driving the expense lower and you're going to get recovery of it over the longer term? Is that what's going on?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Durgesh, it really is just the timing. Previously, we thought we'd get the Texas rate case order by the end of this year, so you'd recognize the revenue and the expense with it. Now given that procedural schedule is in Q1 in next year, so we just defer that expense for this year because we have a laid back date to March. So earnings neutral, but just a change in our expenses there.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just can you comment on the time line for recovery? It sounds like you're not asking for carrying costs on the storm Uri impacts. But maybe just time line for recovery of those dollars. I mean, you've got, I believe, authorization in one of your opcos, but just what to look for there in terms of time line and recovery?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. So yes, you're right. In Wisconsin, it's over a 9-month period. But generally, what we've proposed in Minnesota and Colorado is over 2 years and really looking to help mitigate the bill impacts on our customers. So I think of that over the next couple of years, we'll work through the proceedings here in the summer. And we're also not asking our customers to recover those carrying costs because they're really trying to overall help mitigate the bill impacts. And we have a slide in there where it's over two years, it's anywhere from $2 to $10. So really looking at how we can help our customers here.
Durgesh Chopra: Got it. So you said a decision on sort of the Colorado, Minnesota is during summer?
Brian Van Abel: It should be, yes, yes, later this summer.
Operator: Moving on to a question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: Back to the Colorado pathway, I saw earlier this week that it was put on, I don't know what I think about as the anointed list of nationwide top transmission projects. I don't know what other words you can call it. But yes, how does that change kind of how you discuss this with regulators, the probability of getting the project approved. And then even beyond that, the probability of getting that incremental investment being on that list?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, I think -- I don't know how much it helps, but I mean the reception, as I mentioned before, has been very favorable to the project, and it's very much tied to our ability to hit those, I think, remarkable interim goals that we're shooting for in Colorado. So Brian or Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.
Robert Frenzel: No. Look, I think the initial reception to the filing was well received. We expect that filing to proceed alongside our resource plan, which as Ben mentioned, calls for more than 4,000 or 5,000 megawatts of renewables in the state of Colorado. And when we filed that plan, we had transmission owners in the state of Colorado alongside of us, very supportive, very excited about the opportunity, not only for us to hit our goals, but we're going to help state hit its goals with other energy providers in the state, being able to access the transmission for their renewable goals.  At this point, I think going to be -- we're going to build and own that pathway right now. It's our expectation that our owners are -- the other transmission owners are supportive. But at this point, I think they've declined to participate in the construction and ownership and operation of that asset. That could change over time. But right now, that's how we expect to move forward.
Travis Miller: Okay. Just real quick one clarification on that additional investment. So the plan would be $1.7 billion, is that -- again, just remind me that's what you've filed for and then there could be another $1 billion or does the extra $1 billion included in that $1.7 billion?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. The way I think about it, Travis, is, I'll call it the base double loop 345 circuit on the Eastern Plains of Colorado is about $1.7 billion. There's an additional extension on that loop that would drop it down into the southeastern most part of Colorado. That's another couple of hundred million dollars, $300 million. And then once we get the resource plan approved, and we know where assets are going to get firmly located, then we need to come back and look at how much voltage support we might need for those assets, where they're going to be specifically located and that comes with incremental capital costs.  But again, as Ben said, you take the renewables, you take the pathway, and it's probably an $8 billion initiative in Colorado, all going to keep our bills at or below the rate of inflation in Colorado. Really exciting to be able to transition that state to an 85% carbon reduction, 80% renewable penetration at that low cost.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. And if I could sneak one more in there on the project. What are your thoughts on suggestions about investment tax credits for certain high priority transmission projects or federal-backed loans? What are your thoughts in terms of that support?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. Look, I think Ben captured it early in the conversation, but we've got a plan that's very affordable and reliable for our customers. Any incentives that come with that plan, make it more affordable and more -- and the opportunity to then look at other opportunities to accelerate either our own portfolio or potentially accelerate stuff like electric vehicles in the states and keeping customers' energy bills lower. So I think on balance, it's helpful. But we think we can do it at a very affordable price with or without it. And it's not contingent on legislation passing at the federal level.
Operator: Now we'll take a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll make it quick and just to rehash this transmission point, I just want to just make sure we hear you clearly on this. With respect to the MISO process, what's your level of confidence on this looking more like MVP of the last decade versus being this future 1 proposal being the start of a fairly protracted effort to get these discrete projects underway? Obviously, these have been fairly contentious at times. So I just want to understand your sense of confidence around sort of a near-term reflection in processes of these projects.
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, I'll let Brian and Bob comment, Julien, but I mean, it's going to take time. I mean, that's part of -- that's -- in Colorado, that's the advantage of -- we ultimately might be in an RTO, but you can definitely move quicker when you're not in an RTO process. So I recognize it's going to take time, but the need is compelling, and it will get done. And how it gets built and how it's allocated. I think it's important to keep in mind that we do have a right of first refusal in Minnesota. And I think that's very helpful. And I think we've got a demonstrated track record of building transmission at a very good cost. So I don't know if I'm answering your question fully. So I don't know if Brian and Bob have any additional commentary they'd like to share.
Robert Frenzel: Julien, it's Bob. I think about it in tranches. There's probably some no regret stuff that come out of MTEP21. I think we'll probably see more transmission expansion planning through MISO that will get to maybe some of the harder stuff as you're mentioning. So the MVP projects were a point in time and lined up very well. I think that there's some projects that MISO and the transmission owners in MISO recognize or needed sooner rather than later. And I think that's the stuff you'll see come out of MTEP21. And I am hopeful in working with the MISO that we'll see those by the end of the year. I think there's more -- when they talk about the large numbers, $30 billion, $100 billion, that stuff could take a little longer, might be a little bit more contentious. But as Ben said, absolutely positively need this to meet state's goals and company's goals, and I think it will happen.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. And guys, one further follow-up, if I can. It might be somewhat evident, but the decision to file in Colorado here, do you want to walk through that a little bit? I'll leave it open-ended. And especially on earning your ROE.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Julien. I mean, we look at a couple of things, right? We had originally filed for an AGIS rider and a wildfire rider. We still have our deferral on AGIS CPCN costs, and we have a deferral on our wildfire investments. But really, we're putting those on our balance sheet. You don't want those deferrals to get too large. So that's one piece of it. But also we have some regulatory lag in the Colorado electric jurisdiction. And so as we look at it and look at that and look at kind of how the economies are really coming out of COVID and in terms of the strength we're starting to see there that I think it's really the time to file. And I add to that, we talk about our advanced meter investments that we're making in Colorado, and we're really ramping that up this year of deploying about 400,000 meters, is the first large deployment. And again, it's about getting that cash in the door versus deferral on it and putting it on our balance sheet and kind of kicking the can down the road.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Great. But I'll put it this way, you expect to be able to earn relatively close to your authorized into the future, wherever that may land?
Brian Van Abel: I would expect we'd close that gap, right? This -- I mean, we'll file this case here this summer, but we won't get an outcome until next year. So you will see some regulatory lag in Colorado this year and improvement next year as we get those rates into effect.
Operator: Moving on to a question from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.
Paul Fremont: Congratulations, number one. Number two, if I look at Colorado pathway, how would you allocate the $700 million of investment? Would it be fairly even for the period '21 through '25? Is it back-end loaded? I just want to get a sense of when that $700 million would hit.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Paul, I think of it more kind of in the -- a little bit more back-end loaded. You'd have a little bit of spend as we go through the recovery -- we go through the proceeding, get an approval late this year. And so you start to spend next year, but really the ramp-up is in the back half of our 5-year forecast.
Paul Fremont: Great. So like the last two years, is most -- it would be the lion's share?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. That's a fair way to think about it.
Operator: Next question is from Ryan Levine, Citi.
Ryan Levine: I was hoping to just follow-up on some of the comments on the PPA buyouts. Curious how those potential future transactions have been progressing and what the pace is? And in the context of the Biden infrastructure plan and the Biden bill, if any of the tax provisions there could accelerate or decelerate some of the opportunities for PPA ties?
Brian Van Abel: Ryan, yes, good question. I think, I take a step back and say, we've delivered. If we look at what we've delivered or have pending approval is about $750 million of CapEx related to PPA buyouts. And that's -- and we've if you look at the amount of customer savings, it's comparable to that. So it's been a great strategy for our customers and a great strategy for us. And now you've heard me talk about, we'll continue to stay in contact with our counterparties and still think up to $500 million to $1 billion of PPA buyout opportunities are absolutely possible.  And I think about what we could see coming out of the potential infrastructure plan with a longer-term extension of credits, now I look at what we've been. The 2 wind farm PPA buyouts that we have approved in Minnesota, they were PPA buyouts with the repowering, and that repowering with an additional 10 years of PTCs helps us deliver affordable projects and customer savings. And so I think that absolutely presents an opportunity over the longer-term if we get a long-term extension of credit. So we'll continue to look for the opportunities and we'll transact when we find an opportunity where it works for our customers and works for our shareholders.
Robert Frenzel: Ryan, it's Bob. I'll just say that as we move through the resource planning process in both Colorado and Minnesota, those are other opportunities that present themselves during those proceedings. And so as Brian said, we still got a goal to execute on this strategy, and we think there's opportunity.
Ryan Levine: And then on a similar vein in the context of some of the EV incentives or federal build-out, curious your thoughts on how that could impact your business and impact to some of the service territories if some of those broader federal mandates were to be rolled out?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think it's very supportive of the goal we have for getting EVs on the road and everything that comes with that. And one of the things that we all know is that the range anxieties that consumers have, justifiably so, would certainly be diminished if you had 500,000 charging stations out there as proposed under the plan. So it's only going to be helpful, and EVs are great load for us, and they benefit all customers. And really, I think we're pioneering subscription rates and other things that encourage, not required, but encourage customers to charge off peak. And I think that minimizes the -- we'll have infrastructure needs, but that will minimize it again for the benefit of all customers, keeping prices low. And I just think the economics associated with the electrification of transport are pretty compelling. And this is only going to help accelerate that. So it's very positive.
Ryan Levine: Is there any numbers you can put around the potential CapEx around additional infrastructure that Xcel may have to deploy to support the federal EV programs, if they were to be passed?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Ryan, the way we think about it, right, we have -- our stated goal for Xcel is 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. And that's about 20% penetration of EVs. And with that, we have $500 million of capital in our current 5-year forecast. And I would say we have some industry-leading EV programs with what we're accomplishing in Colorado and Minnesota and really helping our states reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. Then we kind of pivot to the back half of that forecast. So it's another about $1.5 billion in terms of estimates. And that's for that 20% penetration. And if the federal incentives help drive that penetration faster, you can kind of ratably, I would say, scale that up. So we view it as a really good opportunity here longer-term as we pivot and help take out the carbon emissions from the transport sector with how clean our fleet is.
Ben Fowke: All contributed to keeping the prices low, too. I mean, because, again, EVs, even if you don't own one, somebody that does helps with our programs, all customers will benefit from that, and that tends to increase the denominator and keep costs low, which, again, that's the virtuous cycle, allows us to make other investments.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Brian Van Abel, CFO, for closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Xcel Energy’s year-end 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy’s 2020 Year-end Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we will review our 2020 results and share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today’s call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today’s call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. I’m going to go off script for a second, which sizes a little bit dangerous. But in December, utility and I recommended Ben Fowke as utility executive of the year for his environmental leadership. Ben was the architect of our steel for fuel strategy Xcel. He is also the one that drove us to be the first utility to clear that we have an objective of 100% carbon-free by 2050. This is a well-deserved and overdue award. With that, I will turn it over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke: Anyway, okay, all right. So I’m not going to go off script, and I’m going to thank everybody, and welcome you to our call. Last year was certainly a challenging year, but our employees came through delivering on our financial and operational objectives while mitigating the impacts of COVID and helping our communities. Overall, 2020 was truly a stellar year. We executed on our business continuity plans as we kept employees and customers safe, while providing reliable customer service. We are helping to jump-start the economy through our capital investment programs, which create jobs and investment in our communities. And we stepped up our commitment to charitable giving to support those in need including donating a gain of almost $20 million from our sale of the Mankato facility. We had a long and impressive list of accomplishments in 2020. Let me share a few of them. We delivered EPS of $2.79 in 2020, which is the 16th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 17th straight year we have increased our dividend, and we achieved a total shareholder return of just over 7.8%, which was the second highest TSR for our peer group. Our O&M declined almost 1% as we took actions to mitigate the impacts of COVID. The Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and I have requested to acquire another wind farm. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases during the pandemic. Now turning to our investment plans. The Minnesota Commission recently approved our 650-megawatt wind repowering proposal with $750 million of rate base investment. The wind portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of more than $160 million over the life of the assets. It will create jobs, jump-start the economy and reduce carbon. In addition, we are also proposing to acquire a repowered 120-megawatt wind farm PPA buyout for about $210 million. Now this project was initially submitted as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery RFP, but the repowering didn’t result in customer savings. However, we worked with the party on the terms and the project gets now expected to provide customer savings over the life of the asset. So we will move forward with it. We also plan to file our Minnesota solar proposal later in the quarter. This project consists of 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco Coal plant, which takes advantage of existing transmission. We fine-tuned our projections and now expect an estimated investment of $550 million. This lower cost provides more benefit to our customers. We have requested a commission decision on both projects in the third quarter and are confident the commission will see the consumer benefit. As part of our strategy to lead the clean energy transition, we are also working to electrify the transport sector. In 2020, we announced the goal to enable 1.5 million electric vehicles in our service territory by 2030. We have programs and filings underway in various states and our transportation electrification plan in Colorado was just recently approved. And we continue to achieve important milestones in our nation leading wind expansion program with the completion of 6 projects in 2020. These projects represent nearly 1,500 megawatts of capacity and were completed under budget. In addition, we have approximately 800 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2021. We are excited to continue the clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. We also had a strong year operationally. For example, our nuclear fleet continues to make great strides in transforming performance while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of over 96% in 2020, even with the refueling outage during COVID. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by both the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M costs declining by more than 5% in 2020, and this is the sixth straight year of declining O&M costs in our nuclear operations. So I’m extremely proud of the effort and the results of our nuclear employees and their leadership in our industry. Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I’m also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2020, we estimate that we reduced carbon emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels. And we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. We announced our plans to convert the Harrington coal plant in Texas to natural gas by the end of 2024. Working with our co-owners, we announced the proposed early retirement of the Craig and Hayden Coal plants in Colorado. We will address the remaining coal plants in Colorado in our resource plan filing at the end of March. We are also making significant strides to improve ESG compliance, transparency and disclosure as we issued our TCFD risk assessment, our natural gas report on our plans to reduce greenhouse gases in our LDC and our green bond impact report. We earned another perfect score on the human rights campaigns corporate quality index and remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is integrated into our strategy and increasingly important to investors. So I’m really pleased with our accomplishments and looking forward. I’m excited about the opportunities we have in 2021 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong year, booking $2.79 per share for 2020 compared with $2.64 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include the following: higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.32 per share, primarily driven by rivers and rate outcomes; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.08 per share due to large projects under construction. Including our wind generation; lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by our cost management efforts; and finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.22 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lowered the ETR. However, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.36 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. Other taxes, primarily property taxes, reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales. As expected, COVID had an adverse impact as weather in leaf adjusted electric sales declined by about 3%. For 2021, we don’t anticipate a full shutdown of the economy like we experienced last spring. Instead, we expect a small recovery of lingering impacts throughout the year. As a result, we anticipate modest weather-adjusted sales growth of approximately 1% off of depressed 2020 sales levels. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all-electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling could be electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Shifting to expenses. We showed strong cost to management by reducing O&M nearly 1% to mitigate the adverse COVID impacts. We expect O&M expenses to be relatively flat in 2021, reflecting incremental costs for our new wind farms offset by a decline in base O&M. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our 2021 sale proposal as an alternative to our filed rate case. We view this as a constructive outcome that will allow us to focus on the Minnesota resource plan and other policy initiatives in 2021. In January, we filed a New Mexico rate case seeking a rate increase of approximately $88 million or a net rate increase of $48 million after reflecting the fuel savings in PTCs from the Sag Marlin farm. The net increase was driven by investment, transmission and distribution due to the significant growth in New Mexico system the last case. The request is based on an ROE of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.7% and a retail rate base of $1.9 billion in historic test year. It also includes changes in depreciation to reflect the planned early retirement of our top coal plant. The decision and implementation of final rates is anticipated in the fourth quarter of this year. We also plan to file a Texas rate case later in the quarter. Both cases were required as a part of the approval of our wind projects at SPS. In November 2020, we filed a request in North Dakota seeking an electric rate increase of approximately $22 million. This is our first rate case in North Dakota in eight years. The request is based on an ROE of 10.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, a rate base of $677 million in the forecast test year. Interim rates were implemented in January, and the decision is expected later this year. And in February, we will file a transmission expansion plan in Colorado to increase capacity to enable the addition of renewables to the system. We will also file a resource plan in Colorado at the end of March. It will include proposed plans for our remaining coal plants in the state as well as additional renewable resources as we work to produce carbon emissions at least 80% by 2030. The transmission expansion and resource plan will provide transparency into our long-term opportunities will likely lead to robust capital investment in the second half of the decade. We expect the decisions on both the transmission expansion and the resource plan by early 2022. As Ben mentioned, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal. As a result, we are moving these wind projects into our base capital forecast, which now reflects rate base growth of 6.6%. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $210 million for the PPA buyout and $550 million for the Sherco Solar facility. If approved, rate base growth would be 6.9%. Accordingly, we have updated our capital tables and our financing plans as detailed in our earnings release. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission, will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investments, which will benefit our customers, while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I will wrap up with a quick summary. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We effectively mitigated COVID impacts and delivered earnings within our original guidance range for the16th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy by adding nearly 1,500 megawatts of owned wind in 2020. Minnesota Commission approved our wind repowering proposal and the acquisition of the more wind farm, both of which will provide significant benefits to our customers. The Colorado Commission approved our transportation electrification plan. We enhanced our ESG disclosures and made further progress to reduce coal exposure and delivering our carbon reduction goals. We resolved multiple regulatory proceedings. We have reaffirmed our 2021 earnings guidance of $2.97 per share to $3 per share. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our $0.05 to $0.07 objective range. With that, that concludes our remarks, and operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi good morning. Just wanted to start off with what you could say about what type of capital opportunities are you seeing associated with the Colorado IRP. And I was just wondering if you could frame the magnitude of what incremental spend might look like versus your current plan?
Benjamin Fowke: Hey Jeremy good morning. So Jeremy, so two parts to that is really the Colorado transmission expansion plan. And if you have heard about us talk before about transmission. We see a lot of opportunities to really - this is needed to enable our energy transition, right? We need to enable several gigawatts of renewables. And if you think about that, it is enabling low-cost universal scale solar and wind to bring it to our load centers in Denver. So what you will see out of that, and I can’t give you specifics in terms of the overall capital investment. We will file that in the next month or so. But significant investment opportunity on the transmission side. It is really a transmission backbone to deliver that for our customers as part of the ERP. On the Colorado resource plan, I think more detail would come on that. But look at our Minnesota resource plan is a good proxy, where we have several gigawatts of renewables in our preferred plant through 2030. So it will look and feel a lot like that. We are looking at what we are doing with our coal plants and adding a lot of renewables to help us achieve that 80% plan. So we are excited about it, excited by that transparency into the back half of this decade and more details to come.
Jeremy Tonet: That is helpful. Was just wondering if you might be able to comment on how the PPA bio opportunity set has evolved over the past year or so during the pandemic. And do you expect any market changes going forward here?
Brian Van Abel: No, I think it has evolved a little bit. You see, we just announced 1 year generic, we will provide more details and officially announce that in the next month or so as we file it. We are excited to continue to execute on it. We delivered the Mower PPA buyout this year with the commission in this one. We continue to have conversations with our counterparties. I think there is another opportunity if you see potential tax credit extensions in Washington that you get some further repowering opportunities, but it is something that we continually look at and work on other counterparties. There is another good data point to watch is that our IRPs often drives RFPs, where we can have PPAs bid into us, PPA buyout opportunities. So that is a really good opportunity longer term. So what we are excited about it. We have delivered - if you look, we have delivered on our PPA buyout opportunity, we are counting this one that we just announced. It is over $500 million of PPA buyouts, and that is excluding Mankato. So we have delivered Mower, Longroad, this new one KEPCO and [indiscernible] Belmont. So a good long-term opportunity as we continue to look at harvesting it.
Benjamin Fowke: Yes. And I think just whether it is PPAs, whether it is transmission spend, whether it is renewables, you should feel very confident that we have got a long runway of capital investment, and that is what we are really excited about it. And of course, we have been focused on renewables that actually save customers money too, so that gives clean energy transition can be driven by economics, which, of course, then sets up the electrification of other sectors like transport. So I think we have got great organic growth in front of us, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That is very helpful. And 1 last one, if I could sneak in here. Just wondering, what do you guys see as the risk and opportunities with the potential acceleration of Minnesota’s carbon-free electricity goal to 2040 here? And also thinking about on a national level, Biden has set up plans for 2035 there, just wondering if you had any thoughts you could share?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I mean, first of all, pretty pleased that Xcel and our whole industry now is really on volume board, achieving net zero goals. And for us, we think we can do zero carbon, not net zero, but zero carbon by 2050, with an important interim goal of 80% by 2030. But if you heard me talk before, I will tell you that, that last 20% is going to take technologies to become commercially viable because, Jeremy, I think it is incredibly important that this transition is based on economics. So that you do have the opportunities to electrify other sectors with economics and buying. You get a lot of bipartisan support when economics can drive the decisions. So could we go faster than our goal of 2050? Well, it is possible. but I think that would mean that those technologies that we refer to, whether it is the next-generation nuclear, whether it is the development of hydrogen. Whether it is carbon capture working economically, whether it is long-term storage. They have to come into the money much sooner than I think they will. But you have heard me say before, I never bet against technology. So more to come on that.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. I appreciate the thoughts in there. That is it for me. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. So I just wanted to follow-up on Colorado and latest thought process on timing for rate case there. In conjunction with the question, just curious about the shift in your 2021 guide on O&M. Is that driven in part by a thought process on Colorado rate case timing? I also noticed that there is a little bit of a shift in the lighter revenues there as well. So if you could speak to the 2021 shift on O&M as well as the latest on Colorado and timing here as well, if you don’t mind.
Robert Frenzel: Hey Julien, it is Bob. And thanks for the question. With regard to the case, I will cover that, and I will turn it back over to Brian to talk a little bit about your question on the O&M. So in Colorado, obviously, we have been talking about a case there. We filed two writers in the summer of last year. Obviously, we watch what happened with the [Ages] (Ph) writers. We are still prosecuting the wildfire writer. But there is a number of other factors that go into evaluation of our case in Colorado, and we are continuing to watch those. Obviously, the pace of economic recovery in Colorado is very important. We are seeing very strong growth there. But as Brian indicated, our sales forecast still expects a slow recovery with some lingering impacts. So sales is a key driver, and obviously our efforts around O&M and efficiency that we can gain in that business will probably dictate when and how we file a case in Colorado. It is likely in the second half outcome at the earliest. And it is largely associated with capital investments in the distribution business and enabling technologies for us to continue to deliver a great customer experience out there. So more to come from us, but it is probably at least a second half decision for us.
Brian Van Abel: Good morning Julien. On your O&M question, first, just let me say, really proud of the employees and the work that was done in 2020. Just a great effort in terms of the mitigation work that everyone did in this company. About 2021, well it is a combination of things. One is we are continuing to drive sustainable cost transformation. And two, our 2020 actuals came in a little bit higher than we thought in Q3 due to a couple of discrete items, but expect us to continue to drive O&M transformation. Now what you don’t see in our flat guidance is we are adding about $50 million of wind O&M in 2021. So we are offsetting that to keep our overall O&M flat with our cost transformation effort. So excited about what we accomplished in 2020, and what we expect to accomplish in 2021 and beyond.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Bob, coming back to you real quickly, if I can. In terms of - when you said that the - to quote a number of other factors here that go into it. I think if I’m hearing right, perhaps the most decisive one is obviously the sales and economic growth, are there other material drivers that will come into it? It sounds like you are waiting to see the trajectory of this post-COVID year on sales. But I don’t want to sort of mischaracterize that.
Robert Frenzel: Look, we still have our wildfire rider proposal in front of the ALJ right now. We went to hearings a week or two ago and felt like we made a really good show in there. I mean this is a significant investment to mitigate a big state policy desire in terms of mitigating wildfires. So we would ask for a rider. The interveners came back proposing deferrals and we are differing on lengths and return profiles of those. So our, obviously, arguing a decent outcome in the wildfire writer is one of the factors that would go into our decision-making, but certainly not exclusive.
Benjamin Fowke: Julien, probably like Bob said, it is sales, it is O&M, and then it would be regulatory decisions. All of that would factor into a maybe a kind of review and determine whether or not we need to file or not.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, understood. And if you got the deferral that would that be adequate? It sounds like there is more than just a binary decision on the wildfire here?
Benjamin Fowke: Think you would have to just look at how - the devil is always in the details on those things. So that, along with the other drivers that I mentioned sales and O&M would be all the factors that we look down.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Appreciate it. All right guys. Thank you very much. All the best.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you too.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks Julien.
Operator: We will take our next question from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Brian, on the five year CapEx plan, can you just, I guess, go through which of the items are in the base plan versus the incremental? I know the proposed wind repowering and the one PPA buyout is - would be incremental amount of the base, but are investments in the hair between coal plant conversion and the investments with wildfire protection, all of those are - is that embedded in the baseline, or would that be incremental?
Brian Van Abel: Yes. No. those are the ones that you mentioned are basically in the base plan. It is a relatively small investment in the current and the conversion of Harrington from coal to natural gas. We have our wildfire investments in our base plan. You are right, clear that we have the solar opportunity and the PPA buyout opportunity in the incremental plan and hope and expect to get visibility into those by the end of this year. So we can provide color and hopefully at a rate base growth trajectory of nearly 7% if we execute on those.
Insoo Kim: Got it. And Ben just going back to Jeremy’s question on President Biden’s plans to achieve the carbon pollution free power sector in the year 2035. And setting to the side for a moment the probability hacking the federal or state policies to achieve that, do you think when you look at your fleet, the undepreciated value of your remaining coal plants or other fossil fuel units. How do you see that? Do you see that as potentially achievable given the current regulatory and price framework for renewable or what items do you think you are going to need on both ends to achieve that?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, the accelerated depreciation is certainly a factor. But as I said with the prior question, it is far more a question of are the technologies ready and economically viable. Because getting to 80% is not easy, but we know we can do it with existing technology, and I know I can do it in a way that preserves affordability and reliability. But just to move completely away from fossil would require an incredible emergence and acceleration of technologies that I think are still ways away. So I mean, again, if technology can emerge, but 2035 is like tomorrow in utility land as far as technologies go. So I think there is going to be an element of pragmatism that gets baked into those goals. And I have always said, we will move as fast as the speed of technology and that is what we will do. But honestly, I think it is a very much of a stretch goal-based upon the way I see the horizon in front of us. With that said, I mean, there is a lot of good things that come with that goal. We support 100% carbon free. So we are aligned with that. I think under the Biden administration, you will see an acceleration of EVs and an acceleration of transmission build. I think you will see an acceleration of the R&D and the technologies that we need to achieve those goals, whether it is 2035, 2040 or 2050. And I think that is the key to me. And if we can all pull together on that and develop the right frameworks, invest in R&D, have the right tax policies. I think we are going to do amazing things. And nobody would have thought that we would be where we are today as an industry and certainly not at Xcel Energy just five years ago. So I’m excited about what the future possibilities hold.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much for the color.
Benjamin Fowke: Got it.
Operator: We will take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hey good morning. Hope you all are doing well. Just following up on - you can sense the theme on the questions here on federal policy, but I wanted to maybe get a little more specific. We may see further legislation that would both extend tax credits for wind and solar, potentially create a new tax credit for storage. And I’m just curious, if you saw that kind of, let’s say, that there is a longer-term extension, could that be material enough for you all to want to both kind of relook at your Minnesota resource plan, could that have a pretty big impact on how you think about your resource mix in Colorado. Like how impactful could longer-term extensions for wind and solar and kind of the new tax rate for storage be as you think about your resource mix in the future?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, first of all, I think it is overall, it would be a positive. And I think there is also a discussion about tax credits for nuclear as well, which I am fully supportive of in transmission, all of those things are going to enable us to go, I think, even faster because of the affordability equation to it. Obviously, at some point, you do saturate the big grid with renewables regardless of cost. But if renewables continue to fall in price, Stephen, what that would allow you to do is put more renewables on your system, even if you have an increase in curtailments because the economics would pencil out better. So that is probably a long-winded answer to your question. But hopefully, that gives you some insights to it.
Robert Frenzel: And Steve, I would just add that depending on how - certainly the devil is in the details, but depending on how long that PTC extension is for wind, you start to see more repowering opportunities come up as the wind farms exit their original 10-year PTC life. And so that is what you saw with the couple of wind farms that we got approved recently in the Minnesota commission. So I think that could present itself more opportunities if you have a longer-term extension.
Stephen Byrd: That is a good point. Maybe just following up a little bit on this. So let’s dream here, and let’s say that there is going to be longer-term extension of these tax credits and new store, tax credit, maybe transmission, nuclear. Is that enough to sort of trigger a kind of formal review on your part in terms of the mix that you have sort of established or is it less formal? And it would just - you continue to evolve your thinking over time, but it wouldn’t necessarily sort of trigger a reassessment of your broader plans?
Benjamin Fowke: Well I mean, I think it just puts our IRP processes and our proposals that much more deeply and money for our customers. And it makes the economics that much more compelling. Again, I think we can do more, accelerate some of the renewables that we have put into our system within operational limitations. But, Stephen, I mean, if you have got - our electricity because of those things becomes even more affordable, think about the opportunities to accelerate EV and other electrification of other sectors. I mean that would be a tremendous benefit.
Stephen Byrd: That is a fair point. Maybe just on EV’s last question for me, I promise, just if we did...
Benjamin Fowke: Stephen, can’t hear you. Stephen, you both can’t hear you. Stephen, did you go on mute by accident? That is one of the most popular terms in 2020, by the way. The other one is, could you go on mute? And the other one is I forgot my mask. We will move on to next question.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: Congrats on the good year in this challenging environment for sure. Maybe to continue with the EV topic, right? What are the opportunities in the EV advancement, I guess, for you, aside from participating in the changing infrastructure. Have you done some modeling maybe along the lines of if penetration, household versus to levels, this maybe some upgrading into the distribution system. Do you know which areas or which state maybe have more need for that? Like how should we think about that? Because that is what really - topic has been on my mind a lot.
Robert Frenzel: Hey, Sophie, it is Bob. Maybe I will start this, and then I will kick it over to Brian potentially. You are a little bit muffled, but I think you are asking about what’s the investment opportunity if we have a significant penetration of electric vehicles. I think our forecast right now for the next five years has $0.5 billion in electric vehicle. And that includes charging stations and the distribution infrastructure that you mentioned to enable that. And over the decade, that number is closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Similarly, that is all encapsulating into the distribution system. I think the one area that we could probably still sharpen our pen on a little bit is the impacts of fleet and heavy-duty vehicles and how that would impact us. Those are very discrete and high loads in certain feeders on our system. We probably aren’t as sophisticated. We would like to be right now on exactly when and where that would happen because it is largely in the hands of the owners of those vehicles. So it is possible there is some incremental upside there. Our distribution feeders are I wouldn’t say wildly underutilized at this point. And so potential capital expansion opportunities on fleet and heavy-duty vehicles is probably where any of the upside might come.
Brian Van Abel: I think too, Sophie, there is a virtuous circle here. The more EV penetration we get, particularly we encourage customers to charge-off peak, the more all customers benefit. And so that tends to give us that tailwind of keeping our product affordable, which makes more electrification, more easy, everything else more possible. So that element of it is super exciting. You look way down the road, and there is a lot of folks. I think EV penetration could be an extension of the grid, if you will, in the use of those batteries. And I was kind of encouraged by the CEO of Ford when he spoke to us at an industry event that he saw that future too because in the past, I have been told that the car manufacturers are a little worried about using batteries in that matter. Now we are ways away from that. But I mean, when you look down a road, you can certainly see a future that incorporates EVs into the grid.
Sophie Karp: Got it, got it. This is very helpful. And then just on the power supply side, as the renewable targeting goals become more aggressive and possibly, we will see more build out if, as you mentioned, we will have additional ITC or the fiscal incentives. Is there a some area, where maybe you see kind of throwing in their potential coal retirement in Colorado. Is there a scenario where in some of these jurisdictions Colorado specifically or meeting so that you would see a shortage of base load power or like some dispatchable capacity, if you will, like what they have seen maybe in some other regions in that area right now or do you feel that you have adequate supplies to tie you over to the point where you can have dispatchability?
Brian Van Abel: I mean, Sophie, let me just make sure I got - heard your question because it is a little muffled. Could you ask if do you see a situation where because of EV penetration and other things that we might have a shortage of expansion generation? Is that your question?
Sophie Karp: Yes, not as much because of EVs, but due to higher maybe wind penetration and coal retirements emerging.
Brian Van Abel: Well, I mean, that is what the IRP processes are all about. I mean we do take a long-term view. That is why I do think the vertically integrated regulated model really works because we can plan for those kinds of contingencies and make sure that we do have adequate reserves and adequate backup. The point that we have to get across is to hit important interim goals. We do lead in the upper Midwest of reserve and the fleet, that is going very well, by the way. And we are going to need a little more of a gas back up, not necessarily using more gas, but having it ready when some of the renewable resources might not be there. All-in-all, it still pencils out to be cost beneficial for our customers. But those are the kinds of things we have to discuss in those resource planning processes so that we have a plan, to your point, that provides some economic benefits, the environmental benefits and, of course, maintains reliability.
Sophie Karp: Thank you so much. I will jump back into the queue.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you Sophie.
Operator: We will take our final question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: So I wanted to just really quickly. I noticed that microgrids, you guys have a microgrid project, I think, you filed for something, I think, in December in Wisconsin. I was just wondering, what are you seeing or are you seeing any trend in that in any other service territories or - I realize it is a pilot, and I think it is only around $170-something million. But just sort of wondering if there is anything more you are seeing on that end in the service territories.
Robert Frenzel: Paul, it is Bob. Look, we filed first some, we call them community resiliency initiatives in Colorado. And worked those through the process with the commission, and we have now got approval, and we are going to start to build out those initiatives. Haven’t seen a lot of pull in micro grids in the rest of the service territories, but obviously something that we are willing to explore with our customers through the process, but it is been pretty quiet other than Colorado.
Brian Van Abel: I think microgrids have a role in utilities future. They don’t come without a price tag. So the resiliency element of it, those become important things. And what we are always willing to do is figure out how we can incorporate that into our total distribution planning process. And I think you will see more of that in the future. But it is not about cost, obviously.
Paul Patterson: So just to sort of follow-up on that because I guess it varies from territory to territory. I guess within your service territories, I guess the economics simply aren’t there in terms of arbitrage and stuff in terms of offsetting those costs. Is that how you sort of see it in terms of it being wide spend?
Robert Frenzel: Yes, I think that is fair. I think they work primarily, again, in extra resiliency and extra reliabilities in order.
Paul Patterson: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.
Brian Van Abel: Thank you Paul.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s question-and-answer session. For closing remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Brian Van Abel.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. For any questions, just please contact our Investor Relations team, and have a great day. Thank you all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we'll review our third quarter results, share recent business and regulatory developments and provide 2021 guidance in our updated five-year financial plan. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments we make during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including items, ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that I'll turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking earnings of $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020, compared with $1.01 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are narrowing our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share. Now, consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have provided our updated base investment plan, which reflects 22.6 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.3% off of 2020 base year. This represents our base capital. In addition, we've identified potential incremental CapEx of 1.4 billion associated with the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, which, if approved, would drive rate base growth of 6.9%. We're also initiating 2021 guidance of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth objectives. We're very excited about our plan, which provides significant customer value, keeps bills well and delivers attractive returns for our investors. We also continue to help our customers and protect our employees during this pandemic. We stepped up charitable giving to help our communities including donating a gain from the sale of our Mankato facility. For more details, see our slides. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well, including the completing of a re-fueling outage at our Prairie Island Nuclear facility for keeping employees safe while providing reliable customer service. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs which create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and inviting utilities to submit potential projects that will create jobs and jumpstart the economy. In September, we filed a repowering proposal that includes four Xcel energy wind farms of approximately 650 megawatts, with 750 million of capital investment. In addition, the proposal includes 67 megawatts of repowered PPA extensions. The portfolio is projected to provide customer savings of over $160 million over the life of the assets. We've requested a commission decision on the wind proposal by year-end. We're also proposing 460 megawatts of solar facilities near our retiring Sherco coal plant to take advantage of the existing transmission. Project represents an estimated investment of 650 million. We plan to file our solar proposal in early 2021 and anticipate a decision in mid '21. We're confident the commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. We continue to make progress on our PPA buyout strategy. In August, the Minnesota Commission approved our request to acquire the 99-megawatt Mower wind farm after it is repowered. Mower is currently a PPA. In addition, we filed to buy out the KEPCO solar facility in Colorado. While the $41 million investment is relatively small, the PPA is out of the money, and the buyout will save our customers $38 million over the 11 years. I think this is another example of our keeping bills well priority. We continue to make strong progress on our wind development initiatives. In August our 500 megawatts Cheyenne Ridge wind farm went into operation. Cheyenne Ridge was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Since it began operations, we set a record with 70% of hourly load coming from wind generation in Colorado. We also reached an agreement to acquire a 74-megawatt solar facility in Wisconsin for approximately $100 million. We expect a commission decision later in 2021 and this will be our first universal scale solar rate base investment. I'm also excited to announce that Xcel Energy was recently awarded a $10 million DOE grant for an innovation pilot to produce carbon free hydrogen at one of our nuclear power plants. We're partnering with the Idaho National Lab and others to use excess electricity and steam to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules and water using a high temperature electrolysis process, which is 30% more efficient, and a sustainable way to produce hydrogen. And while it's not currently economical, we think hydrogen has long-term potential to be a carbon free form of dispatchable generation, which will allow the country to achieve its carbon goals, while maintaining reliability. I want to wrap up with a couple of comments on electric vehicles. We recently announced our vision to enable 1.5 million EVs in our service territory by 2030. We spent the last few years working with our commission on programs that will enable EVs in our service territory and help turn this vision into reality. Electrification of the transport system will reduce carbon and save our customers money. I'm also proud of the recent award we received from Fortnightly, which declared our EV program the smartest transportation electrification project as part of its smartest utility projects in 2020. We've developed an EV subscription that makes it easier for customers that have charging stations installed at their homes and to be charged a monthly rate for off peak usage, which can save customers money and make more efficient use of the electric grid. So before I do turn it over to Brian for more detail on financial results and outlook, I just want to say that as you probably know, the southeast is wrestling with Hurricane Beta, and its widespread outages. And the Southwest is working around the clock restoring our customers on the damages due to Winter Storm Billy. Our customers over the past three days have restored two thirds of 145 customers in SPS that have been out as a result of this ice storm. I know there are hundreds of thousands out there and other parts of the Southwest that are out. I'm just so proud of our team for focusing on our customers in these adverse conditions. And I'm proud of the industry. We have a history of mutual aid. It's never more evident in storm recovery and these last two events and quite frankly, the entire year. So with that, I will turn it over to Brian.
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben and good morning everyone. We had another strong quarter booking $1.14 per share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with $1.01 per share last year. More significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following. Higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.20 per share, primarily driven by riders and rate outcomes. O&M expensive were flat for the quarter, primarily driven by our cost management efforts. And the lower effective tax rate increase earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, production tax credits lower the ETR. However, PTGs are flawed back to customers through lower electric margin and are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share, reflecting our capital investment program. In addition, other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.02 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts in our mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had an adverse impact as third quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 2.4%. Although, these impacts are better than projected in our guidance assumptions, we now assume annual electric sales will decline approximately 3% for 2020. As a reminder, we have a sales drop mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota, and the coupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado, which covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since sales have come in better than projected and weather has been favorable, we've adjusted our O&M contingency plans accordingly. We continue to closely monitor bad debt expense and work with customers on payment plans. At this point, we expect bad debt expense will increase approximately $25 million over normal levels, which remains in line with previous forecasts. We received approval for certain pandemic related expenses in all states, except for North Dakota, where our request remains on the Commission review. We've also made strong progress on reducing O&M expenses to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. Based on our year-to-date results and updated sales projections, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 1% to 2% in 2020 compared to our initial guidance of a 2% increase. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In Texas, the Commission approved our rate case settlement that reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and equity ratio of 54.6% for AC/DC purposes, an acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. In October, the Colorado Commission accepted the ALJs recommended decision to approve our natural gas rate case settlement without modification reflecting a net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and the historic test year of an adjustment for the Tungsten the BlackRock projects. We view both the Texas and Colorado decisions as constructive regulatory outcomes. My preference is to avoid rate cases when possible. So in July, we filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado instead of filing a comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. We're still in the early phases of these proceedings. In September, we filed the 2021 sale proposal in Minnesota is as an alternative path to the rate case we plan to file in early November. We expect the commission to decide in December whether it will accept the sale or proceed as a multi-year rate case. And as Ben noted we're initiating our 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.90 to $3 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Our 2021 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. I want to highlight several of these items here. We've seen constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We anticipate modest impact from COVID-19. We project electric sales growth of approximately 1%, which reflects a modest recovery over the COVID depressed sales levels in 2020. We expect O&M expenses to increase approximately 1%, which reflects increased costs for new wind projects and lower O&M levels in 2020 due to COVID mitigation. Please note that wind O&Ms recover to regulatory mechanisms in most jurisdictions and is offset by fuel savings. And finally, we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately negative 9%, largely driven by increased levels of wind PTCs, which are credited to customers and generally have no material impact on earnings. In our earnings release, you'll find more detail about our updated $22.6 billion five-year base capital forecasts. The base forecasts reflect significant grid investment including our advanced grid initiative and additional investment in the transmission system to maintain absolute health and reliability and enable renewable generation. It also includes a modest level of renewable, expenditure to improve the customer experience and the natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we have proposed to retire all of our Minnesota coal plants by 2030. Our base capital plan results in annual rate base growth of approximately 6.3% using 2020 as a base. We also have potential incremental CapEx of approximately $750 million for wind repowering projects and $650 million for a solar facility, which are pending Commission approval as part of the Minnesota relief and recovery filing. We're confident the Commission will see the customer benefits of these projects. If approved, rate base growth will be 6.9%. In addition, we think there's other potential upside CapEx that could materialize in the future. Our capital investment plan supports are 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. We've also updated our financing plan, which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and debt issuances to fund the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expected to issue $250 million of equity and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity consistent with our previous forecasts. Importantly, our financing plan maintains our current credit metrics. We anticipate that the incremental capital, if approved by the Minnesota Commission will be financed with approximately 50% equity and 50% debt. This incremental equity will allow us to fund the creative capital investments, which will benefit our customers on maintaining solid credit ratings and favorable access to the capital markets. And with that, I'll wrap up. We're effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. The Colorado and Texas Commissions approved constructive rate case settlements. Our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota will create jobs, help jubilate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We narrowed our 2020 guidance range to $2.75 to $2.81 per share based on solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. We announced a robust updated capital investment program that provides strong, transparent rate base growth and significant customer value. We initiated 2021 earnings guidance at $2.90 to $3 per share consistent with our long-term objective. And finally, we remain confident we can deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations on the update there.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll keep going here on the '21 update. Can you talk a little bit about the thought process on the 1% on an increase? I mean, conceptually I get that you had a down here this year. So it would reverse, but how are you thinking about that reversing? Obviously, you guys are one of the first out there in the industry to give a '21 with COVID impacts. How are you thinking about the back to business and the ability to sustain some of the benefits you saw this year?
Ben Fowke: Hey, Julien. Good morning. So the way we think about it and maybe frame it up into - if you remember going into this year, our O&M guidance was 2% up. We're investing significantly in our wind farms, along with all these strategic priorities, such as our grid investments in customer. And then we didn't see our guidance for 2021, but we expected a similar increase prior to COVID in that range. But now if you look at where we'll land this year, down 1% to 2, and slightly up next year, will roughly be flat to 2019. So that kind of gives - and that's on a consolidated level. Obviously, it's varies a little bit by article. But overall, that kind of gives you a sense of how we're kind of driving cost transformation through our business, as we absorb our strategic priorities and remain flat.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, and even to clarify that slightly, you said in your prepared remarks, the wind aspect of the O&M increase, that would be also disclosed to as well. So when they impact your net margins? I heard you right?
Ben Fowke: Yes. So yeah, that's correct, in terms of where it is recovered.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent and then if I can a little bit more conceptually here, as you're thinking about prospects in the next year. And obviously, things are pending at two figures, but with respect to subsequent legislation in Minnesota, specifically around RPS reform, et cetera. Can you help frame some of the possibilities that are out there today, if you don't mind?
Ben Fowke: RPS reform Julien, this is done.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Sorry, energy legislation, as I suppose there's a variety of -
Ben Fowke: Brian talked about.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, I mean, I'll need you to fill in the blank pretty well?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, I mean, I think - I mean, we'll have to see obviously, how it plays out at the state level and obviously, the federal level as well. But Julien, I think we're very well positioned for whatever happens. I mean, remember, one of the things I'm so proud of is we're leading the way, we've got an 80% interim target, a 100% target by 2050, but we do that with liability and economics in mind. So that tends to bring both sides of the aisle along. At the federal level, if it does become a Biden administration, and maybe the senate flips as well, I think we're probably well positioned to do more with renewable. I think they would probably accelerate EVs and help with our 1.5 million target. I would also welcome the chance as both CEO of Xcel and Chairman of EI to work with the Biden ministration and kind of let them know that 2035 and utility timeframe for the technologies that will be needed is very aggressive. So there's a reason why we chose 2050. Now at the state level, we'll just play it out. But I mean, I think we've demonstrated we can work very well crafting legislation that works for customers and shareholders alike.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent, well, I'll leave it there, taking this time, thank you all.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to start off, see if it's possible, you could provide any early feedback that you might be having on your Minnesota recovery planning application at this point.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob, and thanks for the question, loved the headline on the report this morning and the reference. On the Minnesota R&R plan and the broader stay out proposal. We are working productively with all stakeholders. I think we've got support from the OAG and the environmental advocates for a stay out and so the R&R proposal, we're I would say proactively working with the department and trying to gain their support. We expect to follow our mean rate case next week as the alternative to the sale proposal. And similar last year, we would expect the commission to take that up in about six to eight weeks. So call it early to mid-December timeframe. We'd expect them to make a decision. And look we think the R&R plan and the stay out proposal are very much in line with the Administration's and the Commission's goals and we'd expect a productive outcome in December.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just switching gears here, there's been multiple reports of potential M&A in the industry and some transactions have happened recently. Just wondering, does Xcel have any role to play in industry consolidation or just the Great plants that you guys have in front of yourself as far as the attractive organic growth that really kind of keeps all of your attention focus there, and M&A is not really a big consideration for you guys.
Bob Frenzel: Well, I mean, we don't - it's a great question, by the way. And I won't comment on anything specific. But I mean you've heard me speak over the years that our focus is primarily on organic growth. It's nothing like one times book. And I think our investors love that. But we obviously see what's happening in the industry and the long-term trend to consolidation. It's not like we don't look at things, but I will just tell you, we can be disciplined because we do have good organic growth, and we're not looking to fill some sort of earnings void or something like that. So we're very disciplined about it and I think that's one of the reasons why we trade at a bit of a premium to our peers.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Durgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back and clarify the December sort of timeline that you gave us, is that for the R&R filing? I'm just trying to see what kind of the milestones or timeline that we should be watching for you to kind of get approval on the incremental CapEx that you laid out?
Bob Frenzel: Yeah, sure, so this is Bob again. For the mid December filing, we would expect a decision on rate case or stay out provision. We also would expect the wind component of our R&R plan to be heard in the December timeframe as well. I think the solar piece of our plan is more likely going to be a Q2 of 2021 timeframe. I think that makes up the bulk of the investment opportunity, there's some other areas around electric vehicles and distribution and transmission spend, which we could take up in normal course in separate dockets, but those are the two big buckets.
Durgesh Chopra: Super helpful, so just to clarify wind by this year, and then solar by the first quarter next year, right. Did I get that right?
Bob Frenzel: Correct. Second quarter, sorry, end of second quarter is probably more realistic.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, understood, thank you. That's great. And then maybe just going back to your comments around a potential regime change in Biden administration, I think we hear you on sort of the aggressive 2035 targets, but generally speaking, how does it fit into your current plan? Does it delve into future rate base CapEx growth the climate plan that is and then maybe is there any thoughts in a potential tax rate changing implications for you?
Ben Fowke: So I'm going to let Brian talk about the tax implications. As far as headwind tailwind, I think it's I think it's probably helpful to accelerate our renewable program. I absolutely think it'd be helpful to our 1.5 million electric vehicle goal. And that's something that would create additional opportunities for investment. I'm particularly excited about EVs, if you've heard me speak before, because I don't know if it's steel for fuel, but it's a type of steel for fuel. The variable cost of an EV is significantly below that of a gasoline. The charge off similar rates its equivalent of $0.60 a gallon, so while EVs are expensive today, we think that cost comes down. Biden administration might help that costs come down even more and then we're getting more EVs out there reducing the carbon footprint obviously, and creating investment opportunities for us in additional sales load, which all customers benefit from. I'll turn it over to Brian, for your tax question.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, and the details on the Biden tax and are still a little bit light, but I'll hit on a couple of high points, right, if you think whether tax rate increased from 21% to 28%. Just like the TCJA, where we went from 35 %to 21%, our customers saw a savings of 3% to 4%. So if we go the other way, we expect to see a onetime customer impact of 1.5%, 2%. In a while it's never positive to see that impacts our customer bills, we do think it's manageable. And we did set that precedent in all the regulatory proceedings going through the TCJA in terms of through the majority of our jurisdictions we the customers saw timely refund or saving. We expect similar treatment if the tax rate goes up. On the credit metric side, certainly in increasing the tax rates would help on the credit metric side. You'd probably expect for us to see 100 to 150 basis point increase in our credit metrics. But that depends on the details. I know there is a talk about an AMT related to book income, which would be detrimental in that sense, but that 100 to 150 basis points benefit to our credit metrics really related to if AMT goes back to the prior regime. So those are the two big components from the tax perspective.
Ben Fowke: Excellent Brian, thank you.
Bob Frenzel: I do want to talk a little bit about - hey, Durgesh it's Bob, just a couple add-ons to Ben's comments. First and foremost, on the federal side, one of the tailwinds, we would expect to see is a real increase in the budgets for R&D for new generation, which we've been very focused on as a company, and at EEI and making sure that the next generation of dispatchable generation that will provide reliability and affordability for our customers, and the R&D has started today. And secondly, I don't want to diminish the impact that partnering with our states has had. Federal tailwinds are good, but our partnerships with our states have enabled us to deliver over the past four years a substantial amount of carbon reduction, electric vehicle penetration goals and other investment opportunities around cyber and wildfires and other areas that have been very helpful. So while the Feds can be helpful, I think the partnerships of the state are really important as well, I think we're very much aligned there.
Ben Fowke: And that's all customer driven, which is why I think this clean energy transition happens under just about any type of administration.
Durgesh Chopra: Super helpful guys, I appreciate all the comments. Just one quick follow up for Brian, really. Just Brian on PTCs, doesn't the actual increase in tax rate kind of help you with using higher PTCs increases your appetite for using PTCs?
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, you're absolutely right. It also actually helps from just the L2 from our customers. So you're right about that.
Durgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Much appreciate the time. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Thalacker of BMO Capital Markets.
Ben Fowke: Good Morning.
James Thalacker: Good morning, guys. And thanks for the question, time for the question. Just looking at your updated CapEx forecasts and the rate base forecasts and understanding that the bulk of the incremental spend is probably not going to be sort of fully articulated, I guess, until 2Q of '21. But how are you guys, I guess, thinking about that translation into where you sit within the growth rate. Right now, it looks like you guys are kind of solidly at the midpoint. But should you be successful in Minnesota, would you think that that could put you solidly at the upper end, even with their modest solution you have with financing the incremental CapEx?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, I mean, we strive to be at the upper end of that 5% to 7% goal and the additional 1.4 million, albeit we'll make sure we're sensitive to credit quality, which is really important, would be helpful to that goal. So we're very confident that we're going to be able to achieve our long-term growth rate.
James Thalacker: Is outside of an adverse outcome, I guess, on the solar side, is there anything that would prevent you from being at the top end of the growth rate?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean there's always things, I mean, who thought we would be in COVID two years ago. So there's a lot of things that could happen. And of course, it could be - we've always had regulatory outcomes and things like that to consider, sales and there's always things, but again, I think we're in very good shape.
James Thalacker: Okay. And I guess just following up on that point on sales, it looks like the 2021 assumption is for a 1% increase in retail rates. Could you talk I guess, a little bit about the component to the mix of that as you're thinking about it for 2021?
Brian Van Abel: Yeah. Sure and good morning, Jim. So we kind of break it down between residential and C&I. Residential, we expect it to be fairly flat for this year. We are seeing good strong customer growth of about 1% across the consolidated family. So we expect that customer growth to continue and a little bit of I'll call it a reduction in the use per customer. On the C&I side, I think what you see is we expecting, call it, around the 2% increase in C&I sales. And the best way to think about that is really a - we don't expect in April and May to happen next year, but we do expect to know C&I sales to be impacted. So if you kind of took April and May out kind of the worst parts of COVID this year is kind of gives you a sense of what we're thinking for next year.
James Thalacker: Thank you very much for that color.
Ben Fowke: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Stephen.
Stephen Byrd: A lot of it's been covered already. I didn't want to talk more about EVs and then you provided some interesting commentary. I was just curious, let's assume that there is an interest at the federal level and giving specific financial support for EV infrastructure, what form of support would be most helpful? Is it tax credits, direct spending? And how might some level of increased federal support accelerate your plans in terms of spending on EV infrastructure?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think rebates to the consumer to buy down the cost of the EVs. I do think they're going to come down naturally, as more and more models are introduced, but that would - that obviously, would stimulate purchases and just making it an overall part of industry wide carbon goals would be helpful to Stephen. So I think their support can come in a number of forms. The other thing I would say is kind of this - the addressing range anxiety, maybe a public-private partnership to make sure we have fast charging stations around the corridors for people who travel, those are all things that I think you'd be more likely to happen under a Biden administration than a Trump administration. So I mean, I think we can get through our goal either way. But I was asked to comment, whether it would be a tailwind or headwind, and I definitely think that could be a tailwind for us.
Stephen Byrd: That's really helpful. I guess just building on that if you did receive or if we did see that kind of federal support, is that the kind of support where you would then start to really take moves to specifically sort of accelerate your existing plans? Or is that just more helpful to ensure adoption, more helpful to ensure that your existing plans could work well and that there's actually enough EV adoption to make sense for what you're already planning?
Ben Fowke: I mean, I think it gives us more confidence. I mean, the 1.5 million EV goal is definitely a vision and it reflects 20% of cars that are currently on a road. So I think it'd be very helpful to getting there.
Stephen Byrd: Got you, thank you so much, that's all I have.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Mizuho.
Ben Fowke: Good morning Paul.
Paul Fremont: Hi. Thank you very much. Basically, my first question is, you initially also talked in the incremental spend bucket of about 150 million of EV spend. Is that now been moved into your base spending numbers?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Paul, yeah, that is correct. That is in the base numbers.
Paul Fremont: And then my other question is what's driving sort of a higher level of spend at PSCo and the MSP Wisconsin and sort of a 400 million decremental spend at MSP Minnesota in your base interest?
Brian Van Abel: Well, I think the big part is in Colorado, we're really starting to roll out our advanced grid initiatives. And we also have some transition investments that we need to do in Colorado. In longer term where we had - we talked about it before that we have significant transition investments in all our articles longer term really to enable the generation transition. In Wisconsin we do have some - the solar farm that we just announced, a $100 million solar farm with Wisconsin which is for Wisconsin size that is material, and we do have some transmission projects in Wisconsin. So those are really the big drivers for those articles.
Ben Fowke: In Minnesota, keep in mind, there's a lot of wind that's going into service which would lead to - and a lot of that wind is in Minnesota.
Paul Fremont: Right, so Minnesota is actually lower?
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, you're rolling for the big win spend in Minnesota this year, so when you roll forward from 20 to 24 or 21 to 25 is what you're seeing.
Paul Fremont: Got it, so some of that wind is actually adjust when that would have taken place in another year?
Ben Fowke: The projects have been included in '20.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, go on in service. So then if you think of the incremental plan, right, we would like to tell Minnesota R&R, that's all Minnesota spend and significant customer value in the developed proved that will increase the overall CapEx for Minnesota.
Paul Fremont: Thank you, that's it.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Insoo Kim: Good morning. I think one question from me, in Minnesota what type of momentum, if any, is there for securitization legislation to retire coal plants? And I think - correct me if I'm wrong, there is a precedent the state for getting some accelerated depreciation for the remaining value of coal plants. How do you frame all of that and the potential to further accelerate the retirement of coal plants like Sherco 3 or the game plan?
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Insoo, it's Bob, good to hear you this morning. We've got - we are accelerating with appreciation on the two plants that we have approval to retire early, that's Sherco units 1 and 2 and they're being accelerated and depreciated fully by their projected retirement date in '23 and 2026 respectively. As part of our Minnesota resource plan, we have offered to retire Sherco 3 and the King plants early also with accelerated depreciation. And we think those proposals, we likely heard sometime in 2021, next year, as we go through the resource planning process. We've been very successful and working with our stakeholders in mitigating the transition of these legacy plants of ours. We've taken care of the workforces, and the property taxes in the jurisdictions. And so we think this is just part of the overall package and we've been successful that in the past, and we'd expect to continue in that fashion.
Ben Fowke: The only place we have securitization is in Colorado. As of now we don't have it.
Insoo Kim: Right, no, I was just talking about asking about momentum for any potential securitization in the state, but understood. And just on that, I understand the Sherco 3 and King, what the proposals were the 2028 and 2030 for the two branches effectively. Is that the earliest dates that we should be considering for these plants given accelerated depreciation timeline?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, look, I think that we've taken a proactive approach to propose those in our resource plan. It gives us a runway to manage through the employee and community issues. And so that's our proposal right now.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question today is from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Missing from your proposed incremental project is energy storage. And I was wondering if you could discuss maybe more broadly, what place energy storage would have in your portfolio going forward? And maybe tying that into potential election outcome, what kind of a policy from the federal level would be helpful to accelerate adoption there? Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Yeah, that's a great question. Thanks for that. I mean, I think you're going to see us - and the emphasis on storage will take place in our resource planning proposals, both in Minnesota and Colorado, and we do see a role for storage. It's not I think kind of fear, I mean, it's all our batteries can only do so much. So when you think of technologies that are needed to get that last 20% out, we're going to need perhaps some form of long-term storage to address those seasonal variations. But yeah, just thinking about the Minnesota plan we talked about peaking resources that will be needed. Well, that can - batteries is definitely part of his peaking resources. The same will hold true in Colorado. I would just say too, when we look at what we did with the R&R plan in Minnesota, we're actually saving customers money by repowering wind projects. And so to us, given the economic conditions we're in and that made all the sense in the world.
Sophie Karp: Got it, so are you considering than any other types of storage you can rely on maybe pumped storage, any other kind of older technology, so hydrogen, even that can be effectively deployed to select addresses relations that you have in a cost-effective manner? Or is it just too early to say right now?
Ben Fowke: No. Yes to all of those. I mean, I think hydrogen is perhaps that long-term storage, it can be used in different ways, but storage is definitely one of the things. Pumped storage is on the table. We're looking at what we can do with our Cabin Creek plant. There is pumped storage in Colorado. So yeah, I mean, all those things are on the table. And you'll see some of that get, I think, flushed out a little bit as we go through the resource planning process.
Sophie Karp: All right, thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. So regarding - so it looks like you announced a couple updates around the PPA buyout program, can you comment around how that pace of development or opportunity could change into the election? If higher federal tax rate could influence any PPA buyout decisions?
Brian Van Abel: Sure. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah, we announced to get more million from buyouts approved in Minnesota which is very good to see and deliver significant customer benefits than that solar buyout in Colorado was filed and again, significant customer benefits, even though it's a pretty small dollar amount, from a capital perspective. Yeah, it's something that we spend a lot of time in the corporate development team in terms of discussions and just conversations with the IPPs that we do business with. A couple things right that we watch, if you want to kind of talk about the election opportunities, right, if you could see an extension of PTCs, maybe that provides more repowering opportunities. If PTCs are extended, certainly a change in the corporate tax rate could impact how these IPPs view their wind farms. So this is something that we'll continue to look at and in conversations with. I speak about this as just something that we continue to have conversations is really a long-term opportunity, because it is about finding kind of the sweet spot in terms of ensuring that we deliver significant customer value and finding the price point that works for us actually quite well.
Ryan Levine: Have there been any recent acceleration of commercial development activity in those efforts in the last few months or is it been relatively routable around the conversations you're having with counterparties.
Brian Van Abel: That would say it's relatively routable, certainly some conversations picked up during kind of the impaction of COVID as some of the developers had challenges. There was a PPA that was bid into our Minnesota relief and recovery win RFP, those PPA buyout - was bid in. We were close to getting there, but we couldn't get to the customer savings number that we wanted to deliver and that RFP and so we'll continue to negotiate with that counterparty to see if we can actually reach an agreement that provides our customers significant savings. So like I said, it's important for us to deliver the savings for our customers.
Ryan Levine: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Travis.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you. I want to talk about the election and issues there, so wondering as a follow up for that conversation. What at the state level or the regulatory level are you looking at on election day, any key state level races are a regulatory election that you're looking at or policies at the local level stuff like that?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, I think what we'll be looking at in Minnesota is whether or not the Senate, which is currently Republican, if it were to go Democrat, and you have an all democratic DFL branches and we would be looking probably at increased corporate taxes and maybe some legislation, energy wise, but again, I think we've done a really good job of developing relationships across the aisle and actually executing on just these pretty bold and aggressive carbon reduction plans. And I do think the administration has appreciated what we've been able to do for our communities and things like the R&R plan that we talked about. So I'm not particularly focused on any kind of transformative type legislation that might come out of an election. I say that and Bob or Amanda, so you want to comment.
Bob Frenzel: Yeah. Travis, this is Bob. I think the only other thing to watch is obviously the ballot initiative in New Mexico on elected versus appointed commissioners. And I think we've got a good history of working there well and any new commission, we would we would proactively engage with.
Amanda Rome: This is Amanda. The only other one we're obviously watching closely is the boulder vote on municipalization.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then another follow-up to the whole easy discussion, is that a lot of talking and speculation about who might own and how they might own charging stations? What are your thoughts around that? And in terms of your role are you inclined to own them as rate base, like assets and expand that late which of being inclined on them as pseudo merchant pipe, so to speak assets? Or you have the right to charging the third party? Just wondering your thoughts around who owns and how the economics for the chargers?
Ben Fowke: Yeah. Are you talking about fast charging Travis?
Travis Miller: Either way or whatever - not in home and probably the residential customer.
Ben Fowke: Yeah, on the residential side, or multi dwelling, things like that, I think we're very well positioned to own those charging stations. In fact I'm really excited about our EV plans that would allow you - if you had a home and you wanted to get an EV, we try to make it easy for you because it's not as easy as you think sometimes. And so with a call to us, we can get the home charger installed at no cost for you build it into our subscription rate, it just encourages you to charge off peak and saves you a significant amount of money. So you don't have to compare KWH and equivalence, it's like - I think it's $44 a month. And it's all you can use off peak. And we've done the math; we think it works out really well for the EV owner, but just as importantly, the other customers, because it minimizes the impact to the grid. Now, when you get to like fast charging stations, I think they're really necessary to address range anxiety, but make no bones about it. They're kind of lost. So I think that that's where a public private partnership could come into play. We're happy to play a role there. But we don't have to; I just like to see it done. So I guess that would be kind of like I answered your question. I think that's where we see it.
Travis Miller: Sure. Okay, great and I appreciate it.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Good morning. How you doing? So just quick on the EV thing, just to sort of clarify this, the public private partnership, just to help me out here, what's the public entities or entity that you're thinking about? And who would be the private entities? Just really briefly sort of a - I'm missing exactly what that would be?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, I think it can take a lot of different forms. I mean, the government, either federal or state could provide funding to buy down the cost of those charging stations. It doesn't necessarily have to have an Xcel energy label on it, we could just provide the necessary supporting infrastructure, or we could be part of it. I mean, I would just tell you, Paul, we're wide open to that. The key to me is to get these stations built. So that people - one of the biggest barriers and purchasing an EV is space range anxiety. And so you need, I think, the right amount of fast charging stations, which again, are lost leaders to be built, so that you have more easy penetration. So it's kind of a chicken or the egg type thing and it can take a lot of different forms.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And I was just wondering, what about you guys basically just having a put into rate base so to speak and socializing cost over customers. I mean, I'm just wondering, is that an option? Or do you feel that is a simple strategy -
Ben Fowke: As long as it's - yes, the short answer is yes. But I mean you want to make sure the process is followed. I mean one of the things that we'd want to show is okay, if this leads to more easy penetration, how does that benefit all of our customers? How much it's exactly, how much we're going to socialize? And you've heard me talk about incentives and subsidies and things like that. And I've always been okay with them, as long as they're transparent. So I would not want something that is kind of hidden, where people were not really sure what is being socialized and what isn't being socialized. And I don't think that would happen with these charging stations. But that's what we'd be advocating for, just a real transparent process. Because not everybody - when you say the word socialization, I mean, it gets people upset sometimes. But a selective amount of seeding I think is really important and perhaps we could play a role in that.
Bob Frenzel: Hi, Paul, it's Bob. We discuss two areas where I think we're excellent and also making sure that in a world where we are involved, we can make sure that public charging, whether it's on interstates or neighborhood, there are areas of town and areas that communities that don't get left behind, we want to make sure that there's an equitable investment, and making sure that all of our customers can benefit from the opportunity that electric vehicles provide. And the second area where I think that we are very valuable in ownership and control of the charging stations is really around the impacts in the grid and making sure that we have appropriate incentives for more off peak than on peak charging. Recognizing some on peak will have to happen, certainly in those public spaces, but bouncing the grid loads and making sure that we're optimizing the distribution investments around electric vehicles is really important. And I think our role there is critical. So that leads you to believe that we would be a very good partner or owner of those types of stations as well.
Paul Patterson: Awesome, okay and then just on the tax issue and I just have a crystal ball question and I realize it's kind of fraught, but I guess I'm sort of trying to wonder is, I mean, on the Biden plan, if one were to assume that he got elected, would there be - what kind of sense do you get Biden, in the Congress for higher corporate taxes in general? And do you think it would make a significant difference if it was a Democratic Senate or a Republican Senate or just any flavor there? I mean, when we're thinking about this how - and how do you guys look at this when you're trying to plan in everything and I don't know what I mean, is it sort of like, do you feel that there is a strong sense that people really want to raise taxes in Congress, on corporations, and that that's probably pretty likely?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think, I think to implement the Biden tax plan you're going to need to do sweep Paul. I don't think - I think it's - you might have some sort of form of compromise wrapped around other things if it's sports Congress and Senate. But I don't think there's going to be a tremendous amount of interest if the Republicans hold the Senate and implementing the full Biden tax plan.
Paul Patterson: But if we have a Democratic Senate, maybe, yes. I know, it's really -
Ben Fowke: I think you need a Democratic Senate and then I think if you look at how the Senate would be taken over by Democrats, many of those candidates are running on moderate platform. So I think you'd have to be - it would also depend on how big the sweep is.
Paul Patterson: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Stay tuned, we should know sometimes. Not so sure. It'll be November 3, by the way, but we will know at some point.
Paul Patterson: Yeah. I can't wait. Okay. Thanks so much.
Ben Fowke: Okay, thank you.
Operator: As there are no other questions, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Brian Van Abel, CFO for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, thank you all for participating in our earnings calls this morning. If you have any follow up questions, please contact Paul Johnson in our Investor Relations team. Thank you everyone.
Ben Fowke: Thank you. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Amanda Rome, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. This morning, we'll review our second quarter results, share recent business and regulatory developments and discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around COVID. The slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments we make during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to different from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including items, ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking earnings of $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track with our financial plan, and we are mitigating the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. We continue to help our customers and protect our employees during the pandemic. We're stepping up our charitable giving to help our communities. Our business continuity plans have been executed extremely well. We're keeping employees safe, while providing reliable service to our customers. And we're helping to restart the economy through our capital investment programs that create jobs in our communities. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Commission opened a relief and recovery docket and invited utilities in the state to submit potential projects that would create jobs and help jump-start the economy. In June, we filed a plan that proposes $3 billion of capital investment. This includes approximately $1.8 billion of incremental capex for wind repowering, a 460-megawatt solar facility, expanded EV infrastructure and about $1.2 billion of accelerated transmission, distribution and natural gas investments. We recently announced a solicitation for repowering of wind projects that are either owned by Xcel Energy or under PPAs. We estimate 800 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of potential repowering projects and expect to make a commission recommendation by year-end. We are also proposing options to mitigate customer bills. Overall, feedback has been very positive, and we look forward to working through the process with the commission. Now, as you might have heard, the US Treasury recently announced a one-year extension of the Safe Harbor for renewable projects. Wind projects that began construction in 2016 now have until the end of 2021 to complete construction and received PTCs at the 100% level. While we were confident that our projects would qualify for a 100% PTC level regardless of this change, the extension assures us benefit for our customers should any projects slip into 2021. Importantly, this change also presents the opportunity to move Dakota Range from the originally planned 80% PTC level to a 100% PTC level. While this will not impact earnings, it will significantly reduce costs, which is a great outcome for our customers. Advancing our strategic priority of leading the clean energy transition, we and our co-owners recently announced the early retirement of the second coal unit at Craig. While we only have a small ownership stake in Craig, we are proud to help drive the early retirement of another coal unit. We're also making significant strides to improve ESG transparency and disclosure. We recently issued our TCFD report and risk assessment, which describes the resilience of our climate strategy using different scenarios. The addition of this report enhanced our disclosures and results in a full TCFD compliance for Xcel Energy. Another strategic priority is to keep our customer bills low. As a result, it was very satisfying to see that SPS's electric rates in Texas and New Mexico were the lowest in the country for 2019 as recently reported by S&P Global. Providing strong customer service and reliability and an attractive price is a hallmark of Xcel Energy, and we're very proud of this recognition. We're also excited that after 10 years, we've reached a settlement agreement with Boulder that will result in a new franchise agreement and also a partnership to explore grid site options to meet our carbon goals. The approval process for the settlement will include a vote by City Council in August, a ballot referendum and vote by the people at Boulder in November. If approved, the franchise will go into effect in January of 2021. Finally, I was recently elected Chairman of EEI. It will be an honor to lead the industry in such an important and challenging time, and I intend to focus on three areas. My first priority is the industry's ongoing COVID-19 response related to the workforce, customers and recovery from the pandemic. Second, I intend to focus on clean energy innovation. I'm asking EEI to develop federal and state policy proposals that will bring dispatchable zero carbon technologies into the marketplace to enable the industry to meet our long-term carbon goals. Finally, I've asked EEI to focus on what our industry can do to promote racial justice and increasing our commitment to advance diversity and inclusion. Like our country, our entire industry has been shaken by the death of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd died only a few miles from our corporate headquarters, and Minneapolis was the first city to experience widespread protest and rioting. I think, as a society, we have a lot of work to do. We need to look hard at ourselves, our unconscious biases and our business practices. I asked some hard questions about how we can improve our diversity. I'm confident that Xcel Energy can play a leadership role in driving positive change for our country and our communities. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who will provide more detail on our financial results and our outlook. Brian?
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We had a strong quarter, booking $0.54 per share for the second quarter of 2020, compared with $0.46 per share last year. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include the following: lower O&M expenses primarily driven by our cost management efforts increased earnings by $0.05 per share; higher electric margins increased earnings by $0.02 per share, which reflects riders and rate increases that offset the negative $0.07 per share impact from declining sales largely due to COVID-19; higher AFUDC equity increased earnings by $0.03 per share; and finally, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin and is largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program and other items, which combined reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. Next, I want to discuss the status of COVID-19 impacts and mitigation efforts. As expected, COVID-19 had a major impact on second quarter sales. Our second quarter weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 7.1%. However, these impacts are better than projected in our base case scenario, which is embedded in our guidance assumptions. On a weather-adjusted basis, April retail electric sales declined 9.6%. May showed improvement as retail electric sales declined 6.7%, and June showed further improvement as retail electric sales declined 4.7%. This monthly trend reflects the economic shutdown that started in mid-March and the gradual opening up of the economy in May and June. As a reminder, we have a sales true-up mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. Since second quarter sales came in better than projected in our base case scenario, we have additional cushion should economic or lapse occur the recovery faltered. Conversely, if sales continue to come in better than expected, we will adjust our contingency plans accordingly. We're also closely monitoring bad debt expense and working with customers on payment plans. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $25 million in the 2008-2009 time period as a reference point. Our commission to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico and Michigan have issued orders to defer pandemic-related expenses. We also reached a settlement in Colorado with the Staff and OCC that would allow us to COVID-19-related bad debt expense, pending a commission decision. Finally, our filings in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under commission review. We've also made strong progress in our efforts to reduce O&M cost to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Based on our contingency plans, we expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset COVID-19 impacts in the base case scenario. We're also prepared to implement additional contingency plans, if the impacts exceed our base case scenario. And as we've discussed in the first quarter, there are limitations to what we can offset. We remain focused on providing strong customer service and reliability, and we will not make short-term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. The last COVID-19 topic I want to cover is liquidity. We finished our planned debt issuances for the year, and we were able to access the capital markets on strong terms and issued bonds at record local bonds. We also closed on the sale of the Mankato Energy Center, which provided approximately $650 million of cash proceeds after carving out the gain for charitable contributions. As a result, we now have available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year, bringing our total liquidity through approximately $5.2 billion. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In New Mexico, the Commission approved our constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of $31 million, a ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8%, and accelerated depreciation of the Tolk coal plant to reflect in earlier retirement. In Texas, we reached a constructive unopposed blackbox settlement, which reflects an electric rate increase of $88 million, a ROE of 9.45% and an equity ratio of 54.6% for AFUDC purposes, and acceleration of the depreciation life of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. And in July, we also reached a constructive settlement in our Colorado natural gas rate case, which reflects net rate increase of $77 million, a ROE of 9.2%, an equity ratio of 55.6% and a historic test year as an adjustment for the Tungsten to Black Hawk project. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. On our last call, we discussed our preference to avoid rate cases impossible, especially in light of COVID-19. So we recently filed for rider recovery of our wildfire and advanced grid investments in Colorado, another filing of comprehensive rate case. The riders will cover 2021 through 2025 and provide regulatory flexibility. And as part of our Minnesota relief and recovery filing, we express our interest in seeking an alternative path to avoid a rate case filing this year. We think this would be a constructive outcome for all parties. We've had initial discussions, and we'll keep you posted. With that, I'll wrap up. We are effectively mitigating COVID-19 impacts. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and communities. We reached constructive settlements in our Texas and Colorado rate cases. We avoided an electric rate case in Colorado by filing for wildfire and advanced grid riders. We filed our relief and recovery proposal in Minnesota, which will create jobs, help rejuvenate our local economies and result in significant customer benefits. We announced an earlier retirement of another coal plant and achieved TCFD full compliance. We reached a settlement with Boulder that should end municipalization efforts. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our solid year-to-date results and progress on contingency plans. Finally, we remain committed to delivering long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base, I guess, on your retail sales expectations at this point. Didn't know if you had any data from July, if you could provide us any more color. It seems so far in the second quarter, you guys are trended somewhere between the base case and the mild case. I'm just wondering if you could give us any feeling, I guess, from what you can see so far how the third quarter might be shaping up initially between those two scenarios?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, happy to. But as you know, we don't have AMI. So we have some visibility into July information, particularly we have some sample customers. And what we're seeing on the C&I side is we're seeing a slight improvement, as we look at some of the specific data that we have. We've seen some improvement in the oil and gas slowed down in SPS, something we're watching closely. If you look at the results down there, the kind of bottomed out in May, and we've seen improvement relative still below about 5% from where it was pre-COVID levels, but good to see the C&I improvement there. We're also watching our Colorado C&I. If you look at our earnings release and our presentation, you can see that the C&I sales from May to June didn't improve as much as they did from April to May, so that some are focusing on in Q3, but we are seeing positive trends there. In the residential, I think we're still continuing to see that strength that we saw in 2Q. So overall, positive trends going into Q3, but if you look at our base scenario, we did have significant improvement in the depths in Q2 to Q3. So some, we are watching closely.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just with regards to the Minnesota relief and recovery proposal, I'm just wondering if you might be able to share any more as far as any early feedback that you might have received so far or just kind of expectations going forward at this point.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. Coincidentally, we actually had a Minnesota planning meeting yesterday with the department and the commission to talk through the Relief and Recovery Act. We think this is a really interesting example of coordination between investor-owned utilities and the political community to try and solve some of the problems that are affecting our communities from the pandemic. I think the commentary yesterday was kicked off by Lieutenant Governor with a positive tone. I feel like we had some positive tone from some of the commissioners with a special interest to an expeditious resolution and timeline. So we'll know more as we work through the rest of the summer in terms of timeline, but I think yesterday's planning meeting felt fairly positive.
Jeremy Tonet: Yeah. It's encouraging. That's great. Thanks. And if I could just sneak in a last one here, it seems like your guide, D&A interest and AFUDC equity, all kind of changed a little bit there. I was wondering if you could help us with some of the drivers.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah, certainly. When you put them altogether bottom line, it impacts pretty immaterial for the year. Puts and takes, depreciation changes are coming out of our rate cases. We had some depreciation rate changes that were implemented. Obviously, interest expense, we set a record low coupons in Minnesota. We issued a 30-year bond at 2.6%, which is the lowest 30-year first mortgage bond for utilities, so really good results there out of the team. And then, on the other pieces of rider revenue, right, just a little bit of delays in implementation of wind farms, but net-net, pretty immaterial impact when you take them all together.
Jeremy Tonet: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next, we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, team. Good morning. Hey, thanks for the time guys. So let me take the other side of what Jeremy was just talking about. Let's talk about cost reductions, and let's talk about that in the context of your progress year-to-date and what this means going forward in the future years, right? I hear you guys talking about staying out in Colorado, for instance, leveraging riders a little bit more, but give us a little bit of context and where you are against the plan given the 4% to 5% articulated and then, what that means for sustainability and prospects to stay out in these states?
Ben Fowke: Let me -- I'm going to let Brian give you the details on that drilling, but let me just say, I really proud of how the entire team -- entire Xcel workforce has really stepped up to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, while still providing us important, obviously, product that we deliver. And we've done in a number of different ways, but what most impressed me is the innovation and creativity to use of technology and to improve our business. So I'm optimistic that a lot of that -- we've got to work through, but a lot of this will give us a lot of momentum as we go into 2021. With that, I'll ask Brian to give some more details.
Brian Van Abel: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Julien. Yeah, so from a run rate, right? We've put in the contingency plans in the sense of the end of March, as we saw the fit. And so, we had nine months from a year-to-date perspective. We're about a little over $50 million ahead of 2019, so executing out just slightly ahead of plan when we look at what our plans are for Q2. So that puts us in a good position for the balance of the year. Now, obviously, if sales come in a little bit better, we can adjust those contingency plans for the year. And Ben said it well. The team has done a great job of developing and executing those plans for this year, and we've really turned our attention to what is sustainable in 2021 and beyond. But I think we've got -- when you talk about regulatory flexibility and rate case sales, we're also -- the other side of the equation is everything we've learned over the past few months from the impact of COVID-19 is we're incorporating into our sales forecast for 2021 and incorporating that in our sales forecast for 2021. And so, we're looking at both sides of the equation. And so, a big focus for the team in Q3 from an O&M sustainability perspective, which will deliver further guidance and clarity in Q3 on that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But net-net, fairly confident that consistently earn at authorized levels to the extent to which that you're successful staying out in these cases inclusive of, for instance, the Colorado?
Ben Fowke: Yeah. I think that's a fair assumption. You broke up a little bit. I think you said you would expect another authorized levels with the regulatory proceedings, just to make sure I heard you correctly.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah.
Ben Fowke: Where exactly are you, Julien?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: We will talk about that later.
Ben Fowke: We have enjoyed your notes from the road, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: There you go. So in Colorado and speaking of Colorado, what are your prospects for stimulus here as you think about the -- potentially mirroring your efforts in Minnesota?
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Julien; it's Bob. So if you're in Colorado, we're having good weather out there. We've had a nice warm summer. I think you saw some of our weather-adjusted sales were pretty strong in Colorado. As far as relief and recovery goes, what we've done in Minnesota we believe has been relatively unique for the country, but we're certainly open to the ideas and trying to partner in other jurisdictions. I'll give a lot of credit to the administration and the commission and the department in Minnesota for their leadership and their partnership with us on the R&R plan and getting the utilities in the state to step up and try and help our communities and our customers. And if we can find that kind of partnership, we are absolutely looking and willing to do that. As -- if the pandemic continues or if we see some resurgence, there may be more opportunities down the road for us on something similar in other jurisdictions. We wouldn't rule it out.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Best of luck. Thanks guys. Nice travel.
Bob Frenzel: Stay safe wherever you are.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more when you said in Minnesota, the alternative path, what that might look like in one of the full three year rate cycle filings?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, Travis. And as we kind of put it in our relief and recovery plan, the alternative path is really looking at a potential stay out for 2021. Going into 2020, we were able to reach a constructive stay out with the parties, which the commission approved and that was really focused in a couple of key components around sales true-up and deferral of the annuity amortization, a couple of key components. And now, we're just starting to -- we put that in the relief and recovery plan. I think there is another path there, and we've just started the initial discussions around that. And certainly, we will look to see if we can find a good constructive settlement that works for our customers and us.
Travis Miller: Okay. What do you include potentially something like a rate base true-up, something like that as well or are there other mechanisms that we keep you that allowed or slightly below the allowed ROE?
Brian Van Abel: Well, for Minnesota, the two big components, if you look out similar to -- at least sitting here today, similar to the settlement that we reach for this year as the big component of sales true-up and then, the deferral of some amortizations. We do have riders recover a lot of our investments with our renewable investments -- long-term renewable rider. And we have our transmission cost rider, which covers some investments. So we have rider mechanisms that help recover the investments we're making for our customers.
Travis Miller: Okay. Got it. And then, just confirming that you guys are still on track for that five-year 7% rate base growth and the $22 billion capex. Any changes for those numbers?
Ben Fowke: I would say -- Travis, this is Ben. Yeah, we are on track, and we're targeting the upper half. We'll update all of that in the third quarter when we update you on our five-year capital forecast, but I think you will be pleased with what we're projecting.
Travis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick, does that include the $3 billion in Minnesota or would that be incremental?
Brian Van Abel: That would be -- well, first of all, $1.8 billion is incremental; the other is an acceleration, but yeah, I mean, that's not necessary to -- for us. So that would be incremental.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Next, we will go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Hi, good morning. So just good to hear your voice Ben and have fun being the Chair of EEI. So on the Minnesota kind of recovery investment, has the commission give some indication on the basis of the decisions they are going to make in terms of like, is it based on the amount of jobs created versus the rate impact or just how are they going to make that decision?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think they will take a number of factors into consideration. But I think as you know our steel for fuel strategy accomplishes capital investment, job growth and helps with rate. So. to the extent we can emphasize that, I think the better will be. There will be a solicitation and we'll bring those projects in. We are anticipating that we will have a very good price point for the solar that we're planning. And Brian and Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything else.
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Steve, I think it's still a little bit early innings. But I think the comfort level with the investment, the economic development, the job creation, that portfolio coupled with the relief opportunities as Brian mentioned on rates and stay out mechanisms, I think is a big package. We haven't got a full time line out of them. We had a big planning meeting yesterday, which was favorable with some positive comments from the commission and even the administration. And so we're comfortable and confident where we sit. We don't have a lot of details other than that to share with you right now.
Steve Fleishman: All right. Do you have any sense of the rate impact of the $3 billion. Or you're kind of waiting to see your bidding and all that?
Bob Frenzel: I think we still need to run through the solicitation process on the renewable portions, for sure, which will run through August and into September before we make some decisions. But we're pretty confident that we know the impacts of the things we would put forward. And we know a little bit of what other people would do as well. So we're pretty comfortable with the cost side of that.
Ben Fowke: Steve, we wouldn't put forward our wind repowering if it wasn't NPV positive to the consumer. So I think the real -- will that offset the acceleration of some of the distribution and transmission spend that we're talking about, and I think likely it will, but to Bob's point, we will run through those numbers.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, Steve, just some further color on the repowering. We had the long road repowering approved and we have now or should be upfront the commission hopefully in Q3 and those show the front end customer savings and you got the repowering which is now really good in this environment. And so we're working through similar analysis on our currently owned wind farms that we think would be good candidates for that.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And since most of these things are related to things that you own or like you're pre-assuming it gets approved pretty highly likely it would be you who actually would make some investment?
Ben Fowke: Yes. That's correct. Third parties.
Brian Van Abel: I think that's...
Steve Fleishman: And just last question. Yes, okay. And last question is related to -- so if that is all true, yes...
Brian Van Abel: One thing to be clear on those -- there are parties that could submit PPAs for either a PPA extension or a BOT. So some combination of our investment plus others.
Steve Fleishman: Great. And I apologize. Last question on this which is just how should we think about financing plan for as much as the incremental, you know, more time...
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Steve as we talked about before and really in the filing, we think about $1.8 billion is the incremental part, the other $1.2 billion roughly is accelerated. But as we go through this process, we expect the commission indicated yesterday that they look to find a way to move through this pretty quickly. And at the same time we're developing our five-year capital plans for '21 through '25. And so, we'll put that all together and roll out our five-year financing plan if we have enough clarity to include this in our five-year capital plan by October. But generally, what we spoke about before, timing and size matters for incremental capital, and if it's significant enough and lines up, we will generally fund that with our consolidated capital structure. Now, as we've spoken about before, it's important to maintain that financial strength and the credit quality of the company.
Operator: Next we'll go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Sophie.
Sophie Karp: So just to build on this -- on the rate strategy this year and the questions around that, I'm wondering if we think about more, I guess stay out rates since obviously your right decision given the COVID situation. But if this continues to be the case and the COVID is kind of here to stay and is effective economic consequences will be ongoing for a while, could we see a pivot in the overall strategy where you move away from periodically cases and kind of switch on a more permanent basis to alternative mechanisms and just kind of move away from the strategy of being a -- say a rate case filer to more of a paying outflow for the period for longer? That's my question. Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Sophie, it's, Bob. Good to hear your voice. You were a little broke up there, but let me try and address the question, which I think is, how do you think strategically about rate cases in the context of the pandemic in longer term is sort of my takeaway. And you know, we have a lot of rider mechanisms in our various states and we're making billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and infrastructure around clean energy transition and grid modernization and we also have to keep the utility financially healthy. So that's the backdrop that we work with. We are obviously working with our regulators right now on mechanisms by which we would need to file rate cases and we're actively engaged in conversations with stakeholders in Minnesota and Colorado. I think you saw us settle our gas case and then file a couple of riders, which we think would allow us to stay out of our electric case in Colorado and that's a bit of the strategy. If we continue to invest in areas that have real time in rider recovery, you've seen us execute on decoupling in sales true-up mechanisms in our businesses and that's helpful as well. And so strategically, I think we're in the right places. We're always going to look for mechanisms by which we can mitigate our cost structure, keep our bills low for our customers, while we keep to invest in the infrastructure that we need to. So we'll continue to be creative, probably with our commitment and the goal would be to not go into rate cases, if we could avoid them, but we have to keep the utility financially healthy and so we balance all of that.
Ben Fowke: Yes. And Sophie, just building on what Bob said, I mean, whether it's traditional rate cases or expansion of riders or some combination, the bottom line is we are going to achieve our clean energy objectives, our levels of reliability and our customer improvements in customer experience all while keeping total bills below the pace of CPI. That's our objective. And that's what we're on track for and that's what I think we still remain on forecast to do. So -- because that's the key thing, is to make these investments, while not -- while keeping our product affordable.
Sophie Karp: Thank you. And then a follow-up if I may, on the O&M. So you entered this year guiding for O&M growth year-over-year and then the COVID situation you had to flip that and basically find cost cuts right to offset the impact and it seems like it's going well. Could you give us some sense of the shape of that throughout the year. Are you kind of even into it now and plan to ramp up in the second half or are you pretty much trying a run rate at this point and we should expect a steady kind of O&M trajectory throughout the year? How should we think about this?
Brian Van Abel: Hey, Sophie, this is Brian. I think the way you said it, you assume a steady run rate pretty ratably over the quarter. So I think you're thinking about it right, we continue to see that run rate.
Operator: Next we'll go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: Just a few quick follow-ups. So back in Minnesota -- and I'm sorry if I didn't completely understand it. How much did you guys -- were you guys saying that this capex might be going to third parties or contracts, how much of the total is subject to that?
Brian Van Abel: The $1.8 billion incremental is -- that's our spend. But what Paul was saying is when we do a solicitation, we'll have our own wind projects that we own that we bid into that and -- but we will also encourage independence to bid in as well and they can bid in either as a build, own, transfer, which would result in our ownership or they could bid in with an expansion of a power purchase agreement and we'll take a look at all of those. But at the end of the day, our incremental CapEx will come from ownership in wind projects, perhaps our own and perhaps BOT's, the solar facility that we're talking about at our coal plant and Becker, Minnesota, advances in EV infrastructure. And I think that covers the incremental and then we look at the acceleration of that $1.2 billion of grid spend.
Bob Frenzel: Paul we're not going to -- we're not going to know what other parties are going to build until we get through the process, which would be more towards the end of August.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And then when we think incremental, just to be clear. That doesn't mean bringing something in from the future. This is just incremental, in other words it wouldn't happen anyway, it doesn't change the trajectory of your capex outlook from -- in other words, you are not moving something from the future to now. It's as an accelerated would suggest. When you say incremental, it would -- it wouldn't have occurred otherwise. Is that the way to think about it?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, that's the way to think about it, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Okay. I think I understand. And then with respect to the...
Brian Van Abel: Paul, just on the -- I mean, look, I think the way to think about it is, the $1.2 billion that we're not calling incremental, that's an acceleration of something that's already in our forecast. The $1.8 billion would not be in our existing forecast. Now over the course of 15 years, might it have happen. Yes, that's how we're defining that.
Paul Patterson: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then with respect to the CPI goal, is that still 2%?
Brian Van Abel: Yes, I mean I think it extends a little bit by jurisdiction. Is that...
Bob Frenzel: Yes. That's roughly at Xcel level, a good way to think about it.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And then, just in general, I mean, this has been touched on by other people, but I'm just wondering if this -- if things continues down the road, is there any potential maybe to upsize this, if we have a weaker economy. If -- do you follow what I'm saying, is there any sort of discussion of a potential like, hey, maybe this is a good jobs idea or economic stimulus idea and we could see something maybe a bigger than this?
Ben Fowke: I think I'll let the team weigh in on this Paul, but I think it's probably would come from other jurisdictions.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And you already sort of addressed that. Okay. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Ben Fowke: Thank you. Have a good day.
Operator: We'll go to Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. I just have one quick question. In your guidance for the year end base case assumption, what type of assumption are you making on deferral treatment of COVID-related costs?
Brian Van Abel: Around -- yes, bad debt deferrals. Hey Insoo, this is Brian. As we talked about in Q1, we assume that we get constructive treatment around the regulatory deferrals. When we think about our bad debt expense, we have roughly about $25 million increase and we look at what happened in 2008 and 2009 and that's everything we've seen for the three months of impacts that remains pretty consistent as our thinking going into this. And if we think about it right, we have about 95% of our businesses covered with our six deferral orders, two are waiting for the Dakotas. So we feel like we've reached a constructive place with those deferral orders and we'll continue to evaluate the deferrals as you go through the balance of the year.
Insoo Kim: Got it. So the bulk of -- at least the bulk of what's happened in terms of the approvals were somewhat embedded in making that guidance then.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. That's correct.
Insoo Kim: Got it. That's all. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes. Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. Have a good day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentleman. And welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I turn conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning we'll review our 2020 first quarter results, share business development and regulatory developments, discuss how we're managing through uncertainty around coronavirus. There's an expanded list of slides today that accompany our call on our Web site. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward looking information, significant factors that could cost results to different than those anticipated are designated in earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earning release. I will now turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. You know, as I reflect back on the past few months, my heart really goes out to the individuals and families impacted by the coronavirus, the devoted health care professionals so bravely serving our communities and the businesses across all sectors experiencing tremendous economic challenges. At Xcel Energy, we understand how critical our work is to the health and safety of our communities and local businesses. I'm so pleased with how our employees and industry have responded during this unprecedented time, working to keep people safe, delivering reliable service to customers and providing support to those in need as we've done for over a 100 years. I also want to thank our employees for their dedication, spirit, and creativity in finding ways to support our communities and stimulate local economic growth. Now turning to the quarter. We've gotten off to a solid start, booking $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared with $0.61 per share last year. We believe we can take actions that will allow us to weather the impacts of COVID-19. And as a result, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance. Brian will discuss the financial results in more detail. At Xcel Energy, we're taking significant strides to help our customers and protect our employees, while continuing to deliver critical energy services. Some of our actions include both committing to not disconnecting residential customer service and arranging payment plans if they're having difficulty paying their bills. In Minnesota, we were proposing to reduce our approved field forecast by $25 million to give immediate relief to our customers. We stepped up our charitable giving and are helping our communities during this time of need.  And we are working closely with our regulators and state and local leadership to identify constructive solutions to support our communities and customers. We’re keeping our employees safe by implementing work from home policies, providing personal protection equipment and following CDC social distancing guidelines and enhancing cleaning practices, conducting temperature checks at critical facilities, segregating crews and staggering work times. To ensure continued reliability, we've implemented business continuity plans, which allows us to prioritize work and are prepared to sequest our critical employees on site if necessary. From a financial standpoint, we've enhanced our liquidity and developed contingency plans to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Finally, we expect to be part of the solution to help get the economy back on its feet by continuing to invest in our communities through our capital expenditure programs that create jobs and drive demand for equipment and supplies. While this is a fluid situation with considerable uncertainty, Xcel Energy has always shown a remarkable dedication to serving our customers during difficult times, and this set of challenges is no exception. Moving on to business development. We recently announced the opportunistic sale of the Mankato natural gas plant for $680 million. You recall we originally proposed this acquisition as a fully regulated assets. However, when the Minnesota commission rejected this proposal, we acquired Mankato as a non-regulated asset and stepped into the power purchase agreement. While we thought Mankato would provide significant long-term value, especially as we shut down coal assets, we've heard from several investors that having a non-regulated asset cloud at the Xcel Energy story. As a result, when several potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the plant, we decided to sell it and preserve our status as one of the very few fully regulated pure play utilities. And since the earnings were back end loaded, we don't expect the sale to materially impact our earnings projections. And while it was not part of the rationale for the sale, the transaction will improve our liquidity in these uncertain times. We will use the proceeds to reduce funding needs and improve our credit metrics. In addition, we will book again, which we will use to fund charitable giving efforts, including supporting COVID-19 relief efforts throughout our communities. Finally, we recently announced some important promotions as part of our succession plan. Bob Frenzel was named President and Chief Operating Officer and Brian Van Abel was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob has been our CFO for the past four years and has extensive experience in industry prior to joining Xcel Energy. While Brian has had increasing roles in finance, including treasurer, financial planning and analysis and corporate development. Both Bob and Brian are extremely intelligent and talented employees who have been instrumental in developing and executing our strategy and delivering a consistently strong financial. And while I don't plan to retire anytime soon, these promotions reflect a deep bench strength and thoughtful plan we have at Xcel Energy. So with that, let me turn the call over to Brian who’ll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, along with our actions to mitigate coronavirus impacts. Brian?
Brian Van Abel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning everyone. We achieved solid results recording $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.61 per share last year. The majority of the quarterly deviation is driven by weather. We experienced warmer than normal winter weather this year compared with cooler than normal weather last year, which results in $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison. While significant earnings drivers for the quarter include lower O&M expensive increased earnings by $0.03 per share, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits are sold back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were, lower margins due largely to unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share and which offsets riders and regulatory outcomes. Increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and other items combined decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Next, I want to discuss the potential impact to COVID-19 and the actions we are taking to mitigate our range of outcomes. Starting with sales, our first quarter of weather and leap-year adjusted electric sales declined by 1.1%, while natural gas sales increased by 0.4%. The coronavirus virus crisis had a minor impact in first quarter sales. The economic shutdown started in mid-March, so we did not experienced the full monthly impact. From March, our total residential sales increased slightly, while C&I sales declined 4%, resulting in a total retail electric sales decline of 3% on a weather adjusted basis. However, a better reference point on the monthly COVID-19 impact is what we saw in our preliminary April numbers in which almost all of our states were under relatively strict shelter in place orders. Residential sales increased 3.2% while C&I sales declined 13.7% and total retail electric sales declined 9.6% on a weather adjusted basis. And keep in mind we have a sales mechanism for all electric classes in Minnesota and decoupling for the electric residential and non-demand small C&I classes in Colorado. This covers about 45% of our total retail electric sales. And to help us prepare financially for the pandemic, we developed three sales scenarios as outlined in our presentation. The mild scenario assumes a severe impact through May followed by a relatively quick recovery in the third quarter. This results in the sales decline of approximately 2% compared to 2019. Our base case, and the case in which we are reaffirming our earnings guidance around as soon as the severe impact through the second quarter with the slower U-type shape recovery with lingering effects for the rest of 2020. This results in the sales decline of approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis. And lastly, the severe scenario, as soon as the severe impact lasts through the third quarter, followed by a portracted L-type shape for recovery. This is a challenging scenario with a deeper and longer bottom in our base case, resulting in a sales decline of approximately 8% for the year. We use these scenarios as we develop our contingency plans. We view the mild and severe case scenarios as having a low probability of occurring. We think the base case scenario is the most likely outcome, or at least within the band around the sales impact we've outlined, we have incorporated a base case into our guidance assumptions. There was considerable uncertainty on what will actually occur, particularly the duration of the downturn and the lingering effects, which [Technical Difficulty] feel confident in our ability to mitigate what we view as the most likely scenario, and the April sales results came in slightly better than our forecast giving us greater confidence. We're also closely monitoring our bad debt expense and working with our customers on payment plans that are having difficulty paying their bills. While it is difficult to project where we'll land, bad debt expense increased approximately $20 million in the 2008 to 2009 time period as a reference point. Additionally, our commissions in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan, have issued orders to track and defer pandemic related expenses. We've also filed for deferred accounting treatment of incremental COVID-19 related expenses, including bad debt in Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Dakota. We're implementing contingency plans to reduce our overall cost structure and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Some of these actions include cost reductions related to employee expenses, consulting, variable compensation, deferral of certain work activities and the implementation of hiring freeze. Based on our contingency plans, we now expect annual O&M expenses will decline 4% to 5% in 2020, which should offset the impacts of COVID-19 in the base scenario. We also have plans in place to ensure that we can implement additional contingency plans if the negative impacts of COVID-19 exceed our base case scenario. However, there are limitations to what we can offset. We will focus on providing strong customer service and reliability. And we will not make short term decisions that have a negative long-term impact on our customers or shareholders. Turning to supply chain. The situation is fluid but we have not had any material impact to our supply chain with the exception of our wind farms. In mid April, we were informed of supply chain disruptions, which will likely result in delays in completion of two of our wind farms into 2021. We are monitoring the situation closely and are striving to complete the project this year. However, we have fully documented our activities since 2016 and have maintained continuous efforts since then. So we are confident these wind farms will qualify for 100% PTC benefit even if they are completed in 2021. And the last topic I want to cover on COVID-19 is liquidity. We're in a very strong position after enhancing liquidity in March by entering into $700 million term loan with attractive terms, and we issued $600 million 10-year holding company bond. We now have available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion. In addition, the sales proceeds from the Mankato plant will increase liquidity by approximately $650 million. And finally, we issued an equity forward last year, which we expect to settle later this year and will provide another approximately $740 million in cash. In total, this will provide liquidity of nearly $4.5 billion. We also plan to issue $1.9 billion of operating company debt throughout the year. As a result of our enhanced liquidity, we have the flexibility on issuance timing to ensure that capital markets are accessible at attractive terms. For more detail on liquidity, please see our earnings release. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We have three rate cases pending and the coronavirus has not resulted in any material delays in regulatory proceedings. In New Mexico, we reached a constructive unanimous settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk coal plant to reflect an earlier retirement. We are awaiting a hearing examiner recommendation and commission decision. In Texas, SPS and intervening parties have reached an unopposed constructive settlement agreement in principle. We are working with parties to document and file the settlement, which we expect to appear shortly. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter. In February 2020, we filed a natural gas case in Colorado seeking a net rate increase of $127 million based on an ROE of 9.95% and an equity ratio of 55.8%. It is fairly early in the process so there's not much to report, but the procedural schedule hasn't set with new rates expected to become effective in November based on statutory requirements. In terms of the earnings, there’s considerable uncertainty around the coronavirus impacts. Therefore, we have implemented contingency plans to manage our cost structure and made regulatory filings that will help to offset the impact of COVID-19. As a result, we still expect to deliver 2020 earnings within our original guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share based on our base case scenario, which we think is the most likely scenario. In addition, we can implement additional O&M contingency plans if the COVID-19 impacts exceed the base case. However, there are limitations to what we can offset as we balance short term and long-term for both our customers and investors. Our contingency plans are not offset the severe scenario, which would likely result in earnings below our guidance range but we feel the severe scenario has a low probability of occurring. With that, I will wrap up. We have implemented steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We sold the Mankato facility for a modest gain. We increased our dividend 6.2%. We reached constructive rate case settlements in New Mexico and Texas. We remain committed to delivering on our 2014 guidance and our long-term earnings and dividend growth within our 5% to 7% objective range. We continue to provide reliable energy service to our customers, while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and communities. Despite the near term economic challenges, we're executing our strategy extremely well and we remain positive about the opportunities in front of us for the benefit of our customers, communities and shareholders. And finally, we believe we can help rejuvenate our local economies and work with our regulators and state leadership to help our communities and customers recover from the crisis. We're looking forward to being part of the solution. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to just get an update at a high level in terms of the opportunity for additional PPA buyouts. Just what are you seeing in terms of the opportunity, or is that sort of a little bit on pause just given the COVID-19 dynamics? And just curious at a high level what your views are on that opportunity?
Ben Fowke: We're all focused on COVID-19, but we're still running a business and still looking for opportunities. Brian, do you want to give a little more detail?
Brian Van Abel: And so as we think about it, we're in regular contact with our counterparties. Obviously, there could be potential here as you see what's happening. And if any of them have an interest of selling, we're certainly regular in contact. We have our proceeding of the Mower acquisition in front of the commission, and we hopefully see a decision of that in Q2 or Q3. But then we're also looking at how we use the ERP and our IRP processes to help jump start some of that too. Some of the discussions around our acquisitions in Minnesota is how can we better improve the process with the department, our stakeholders, to ensure that we're bringing it forward and have a comprehensive discussion. So we're certainly active on that stage. And you know, we've talked before it continues to be part of our plan, but we don't include any of that in our base capital plan.
Stephen Byrd: And just maybe at a high level in terms of resource planning. How do you think about the opportunity for further acceleration of renewables? I guess on the positive side, renewable costs keep dropping. We may -- there's always a potential for tax credits to get extended. The wind credit got extended again last year. On the negative side, I guess you have demand uncertainty from COVID. In Texas, we have uncertainty around the status of the energy sector overall. But how do you think about the potential for additional sort of renewables growth, additional shutdowns of some of your coal assets? Do you feel about the same as you felt before? Are there reasons to be more bullish or more cautious? How would you think about that?
Brian Van Abel: I guess the short answer is probably a little more bullish. The cost, as you mentioned, Stephen, continued to come down. And so our feel for fuel strategy continues to be, I think, obviously economically attractive. And I think the test of that was the ability to get our renewables approved in Texas and in New Mexico and basically on economic terms. I think the other element too, Stephen, which makes me bullish is that, and this is where I think we can partner with our states and our commissions and state administrations, to be part of the solution in getting people back to work and that's potentially accelerating some of our capital opportunities. And using that to bring on more renewable at a great price point that actually helps save customers’ money and employees’ jobs, good jobs. So not unlike when we had the great recession and can tell you many times that we have people stop me, people typically working in our labor unions and actually thank myself and really the company for continuing to go forward with projects, because that was the only job we have. And that's something to be really proud of and I think we can replicate that again.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Peters with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
David Peters: I was wondering if you could just give a view of where you guys see yourself with earnings guidance range in any of this base scenario?
Ben Fowke: Where we are in the guidance range…
David Peters: Yes…
Ben Fowke: I guess first I would say take a look at our track record over the last 15 years. I think we've demonstrated that we can deliver within the earnings guidance range, typically that's been at the middle or above. So we're quite proud of that and we expect we'll be able to do that this year. But if you look at what we've done in the past and our track record, on the first quarter earnings call, we don't give any additional guidance whether we're going to be the bottom, the top or whatever. So that's the first quarter. We're confident onto the base case scenario we'll be in the earnings guidance range. And as the months and quarters roll on as we've done in the past, we’ll potentially get more color on it.
David Peters: And then just preliminary sales data for April. Do you have a sense of which states are seeing more weakness than others, just understanding that you have decoupling in Minnesota and some protection in Colorado as well?
Ben Fowke: David, well, the question about what states were affected, what the divergence in the states for April. Is that basically what you're asking, you're kind of breaking up on…
David Peters: Yes, that's right.
Ben Fowke: I think as we look at it, we saw the most resiliency on the C&I side in SPS, and probably the biggest impact on the C&I side in Minnesota and Wisconsin, the northern territory. So I think that's the color certainly we'll watch it as we go over time. Now, part of what we saw in Minnesota is we did have a combined heat and power plant as we've talked about on our call before go online in May of last year. So that's part of what we see and we look at month over month, but overall commentary greatest weakness in C&I side, Minnesota and Wisconsin and less so in SPS and Colorado is roughly in the middle of those two.
David Peters: And then last question I had is just I think you said the equity forward that you expect to settle around year end, but just on the Mankato sale. Does that impact the equity plans at all either for this year or next? Just kind of what you guys weighed out last year?
Ben Fowke: No, it doesn't. When I say we’ll use it to reduce our financing costs for this year but we don't expect to not sell our equity forward this year. We do plan to settle it but what Mankato does is really it’s infusion of cash of $650 million, and it’ll provide some additional headroom on capital investment if we have an opportunity to potentially accelerate investments, and really help our communities, and customers, and the regulators accelerate some of this rebound from this crisis. So I think it gives us just an additional capital headroom. As we think about longer term, we think about our five year plan. We'll reevaluate that and overall financing plans as we get to Q3 and lay out a new five year capital plan.
David Peters: And I think final question is the two renewable projects that you've mentioned that could flip into ‘21, which ones were that?
Ben Fowke: Those are the two Minnesota farms that we're looking at. But I would say we've done, as you'd expect from us, we've taken a very conservative approach and then made sure we've had all the documentation since 2016, and we've maintained continuous efforts since then. So we're highly competent even if they do slip a month or two into 2021 that will qualify for 100% PTCs.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off, I guess, do you have any regulatory obligations or guarantees associated with the wind that could impact our earnings, because of the project delay into ‘21 here? Just want to touch base on that point.
Brian Van Abel: We have no obligations in terms of getting in service in 2020 and we're certainly working towards that, and that's our goal is to get them completed in 2020. But in terms of obligations and in term of timing we don't. There are obligations in terms of overall cost gap, but we're certainly working to mitigate any impacts on that as you start to see a delay in schedule. We're certainly working with our suppliers and our plant contractors to get those, to ensure that we bring it in under the original order PTC cost cap.
Ben Fowke: Yes, so we're pretty comfortable with that, Jeremy.
Bob Frenzel: In addition, the SPS has been projects that we have 100% PTC guarantee. But again, we think that those are getting into construction by the end of the year and we're fairly confident on 100% PTC.
Jeremy Tonet: And just a cleanup questions, Slide 17. It seemed like AFUDC equity ticked up a bit there. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that?
Ben Fowke: Yes, from our regional guidance it did as you start to see some delays in some projects, and part of that was our Blazing Star 1 wind farm that we just put in service in April. That took as we were in the winter time, it took a little bit longer, so that's part of it. So just kind of across the board as you see part of it’s wind farm and part of it some other investments that we're making. And there's also a little bit higher -- as we took steps to improve our liquidity also a little bit higher AFUDC rate.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Julian Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alex McKerrell: This is Alex McKerrell calling in for Julian. My first question is about your rate case filings that you have for this year. I was wondering, if you have any updates on whether or not you could potentially push out Minnesota again or potentially push out Colorado? And maybe how you're thinking about using existing trackers to track that rate base instead?
Bob Frenzel: We recognize that these are challenging times, and we do like to work with our regulators in advance. In both Colorado and Minnesota, we have been investing in infrastructure and assets that our customers value and our regulators support. But like in the past, we do think there are mechanisms that will allow us to not file those rate cases. And you can be assured that those conversations are happening with the staff in the commissions as applicable in the respective states. We like to not file those cases and we probably have more information for you on the second quarter call later this year.
Alex McKerrell: My second question and my last question, just about your CAGR overtime. I was wondering if you're still anticipating potentially upper end of that long term guidance? And thank you again.
Ben Fowke: Yes, I think it's a great question. Again and I talked a little bit about it with an earlier question. But you look at what drives our 5% to 7% growth and it's investing in projects and opportunities that are very much aligned with our states, our communities, our regulators, our legislators. So, I don't see that changing and I don't see changes to our CapEx forecast unless to the upside going forward. So that's what drives the growth and that’s where we'll get it from.
Bob Frenzel: One of the things I think we've done as a company is on sunny days prepare for the stormy days, and we've got great dry powder on our balance sheet and Brian mentioned the other things we did. We also continue to invest in our system, keeping it strong and reliable. And so that allows you to weather situations like that and potentially come back stronger and a partner with our states as we look to jump start the economy when we get, all get through this.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: The question on the contingency plans, I think you might have answered this real quickly. But on the O&M side how much of these contingency plans have you been able to accomplish so far? We've been talking about first in the four or five months of the year. And then any change in the CapEx plan within those contingency plans? I think you just answered no, but just want to clarify the O&M side and then the CapEx side.
Brian Van Abel: We've really see no plans in our CapEx for this year. On the O&M side this crisis hit relatively recently so working through all those plans. And we have a plan for balance of the year in terms of implementing them. I think Ben said it pretty well is you often hear Ben and Bob talk about dry powder and you know that's been used in the context of our financial dry powder with our strong balance sheet, our conservative dividend payout ratio, but we also have operational dry powder. And you know we've invested in the system and then in the good days and as the time of crisis here, we’re able to weather it. And we look at, when we think about the O&M contingency plans, we're putting in place, whether it's we’ve implemented the hiring freeze, we're looking at reducing employee expesens and that will happen over time, reducing consulting spend or other programs. And as we think about it we're targeting, as I talked about, targeting 4% to 5% purely mitigate that base case scenario. So we do have the ability to flex up all those, but it's a little bit worse.
Travis Miller: So evenly spread more or less throughout the year?
Brian Van Abel: That's a fair assumption.
Travis Miller: And then on the renewable development. How much are those delays project specific and how much are you seeing just across the entire industry supply chain issues or other financing delays, construction delays, stuff like that industry wide versus couple of projects you mentioned?
Bob Frenzel: We work with our OEM vendors as well as our balance of plant providers to execute the schedules. We have seen some supply chain disruptions started when China shut down for a while. We've had mild disruptions from other plants where we get some of our components. We think that's an industry wide phenomena. I think, as Brian mentioned, we've been exceptionally diligent in tracking our costs. We are really comfortable with our ability to meet the safe harbor provisions for achieving 100% PTC. These are projects that were originally scheduled to be later in this year anyway. And so while we're trying actively to get them completed in 2020, there's the potential that do slip into ’21. But I do think it's stuff we're seeing around the industry and also not only is it our vendors but there's a logistics and a supply chain issue with ports and parts transport that we're seeing. It's not, I wouldn't say it's catastrophic by any stretch, it's just mild we just happen to have these later dated projects for us.
Ben Fowke: We're very, very confident. I've worked with outside firms to know we’ll pass the continuous efforts test.
Travis Miller: Any difference you're seeing between solar and wind in terms of what you just talked about with supply chain and other logistics?
Brian Van Abel: Right now, Travis, we're only building wind farms on our own balance sheet. I haven't seen or heard a lot of solar delays. There's been a couple of public force majeure filings on some solar farms around the country, but I don't think we could speak with any authority on the solar side.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Sophie Karp: I was curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply chain disruptions that we've been talking about, particularly with these two wind farms. What you guys have seen in the supply chain? And also do you expect that the issues may in fact sort of other areas, maybe traditional power generation, transmission, distribution businesses where it might affect the the availability of parts and things like that as we move forward and the lockdowns and disruptions continue? Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: We haven't seen any supply chain disruptions on any of our other components other than maybe toilet paper and hand sanitizer and face mask. But on the wind farms themselves, a lot of the components are manufactured in overseas and assembled here. And so depending on the progress of the pandemic and which country it hit, which factories has caused, two, three, four week delays in various places, which compounded equals maybe a six, or seven, or eight week delay on our projects and that was enough to push them across, potentially push them across the go line. We're seeing not just constraints on the OEM sidebut we do see logistics constraints around ports and air travel and shipping as well, and so that's caused some of the problems. I can't say that we've seen any other disruptions on any of our other components, we just haven't. Those discrete items are suffer watching closely. As Ben and Brian has said, we feel very confident in our ability to qualify for the PTCs at 100%, and we're working diligently with our vendors and our transportation providers to get all the components here and get them constructed by the end of the year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time, I turn the conference back to Brian Van Abel for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Van Abel: Yes, thank you. And thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our investor relations team for any follow up questions, and have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy Year End 2019 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. Today we will discuss and review our 2019 results, update you on financial plans and objectives, share recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures including ongoing earnings and electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone, 2019 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments. Let me share a few. We delivered EPS of $2.64 in 2019, which is the 15th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We raised our annual dividend by $0.10 per share, which is the 16th straight year we've increased our dividend. Our stock hit an all-time high of $66.05 in September, and subsequently, hit an all-time new high of $67.69 this week. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%. Our O&M declined almost 1%, even while making incremental investments in our system. The Minnesota Commission approved our purchase of the Longroad wind assets. And finally, we resolved multiple rate cases. We also had a strong year operationally. We continued to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion program with the completion of our Foxtail, Lake Benton and Hale projects. These three projects represent over 700 megawatts and were completed under budget. In addition, we have almost 2,000 megawatts of wind projects under construction, which are expected to be completed in 2020. We're very excited to continue our clean energy transition, which will result in significant customer savings and carbon reductions. Our nuclear team continues to make great strides in transforming performance, while reducing cost. The fleet achieved a capacity factor of 92.6% in 2019, even with two refueling outages. We have one of the top-performing nuclear fleets in the country as rated by the NRC and INPO. And in addition to strong performance, we have continued to lower our cost structure, with O&M cost declining a little over 2% in 2019, and this is the fourth straight year of declining O&M in our nuclear operations. I'm extremely proud of the effort and results of our nuclear employees and our leadership in our industry. Moving to the wire side of our business. Our advanced grid efforts have progressed well and will enable increased reliability and security, faster storm restoration, better efficiency and new offerings for our customers. In 2019, we implemented foundational software and completed our initial meter deployment in Colorado, as planned, with full-scale implementation to follow. In November, we requested approval to expand our advanced grid program to benefit our Minnesota customers, and we expect a commission decision later this year. Beyond our strong financial and operational performance, I'm also very proud of our ESG leadership. In 2019, we estimate we reduced carbon emissions by more than 40% from 2005 levels, and we remain on track to achieve an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In recognition of our carbon-free vision, S&P Global gave us their Award of Excellence, and we continue to proactively mitigate the impacts of our clean energy transition on our employees and our communities. We've provided assistance to impacted employees, offering retraining and relocation opportunities, and we're levering natural attrition. As a result, we've managed our transition with no layoffs from coal plant retirements. We've also partnered with our communities impacted by the closing of coal plants to build new generation at existing sites, and we've worked hard to attract new businesses to those communities as well. In Minnesota, there is continued progress to build a Google data center and relocate a metal recycling plant next to our closing Sherco coal plant. In Colorado, we've worked to develop a solar solution to retain a steel mill, which is our largest customer and a major employer in Pueblo, where we are closing two coal units. Now these collaborative economic development efforts will help sustain local economies in terms of both jobs and tax base. And our results have been recognized by others. We were named as one of Fortune Magazine's Most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year, one of Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens and among Newsweek's Most Responsible Companies. We earned another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, and we remain among the best places to work for LGBTQ equality. In addition, various publications continue to recognize our strong leadership as a veteran employer. All of this adds up to an outstanding ESG record, which is becoming increasingly important to investors. So I'm really pleased with our accomplishments. And looking forward, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in 2020 and beyond. We will continue executing on our multistate wind investment program, which will provide clean, affordable energy to our customers. Longer term, we will add more universal solar, storage and firm capacity to our system as part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We'll deliver on our planned transmission projects while collaborating with others to solve congestion issues over the next decade. This work is critical to maintaining reliability as more renewables are added to the system, and it also creates significant investment opportunities well into the future. Implementation of our advanced grid program will also keep the grid reliable, secure and efficient and allow for the integration of more renewables while enabling new offerings for our customers. We will continue working with our customers, policymakers and other stakeholders to build nation-leading EV programs, which will improve the customer experience and reduce emissions across the transportation sector. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, who'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2019 results. For details on our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. We achieved another year of strong operational and financial results. We delivered 2019 ongoing earnings of $2.64 per share, which is a 6.9% increase compared with $2.47 per share in 2018. This result represents the top end of our original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Similar to last year, weather was a positive factor, contributing almost $0.07 per share compared to normal. However, we also incurred additional O&M expense, including approximately $0.03 per share due to storms, partially offsetting the weather benefit. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.37 per share, including rate increases in riders to recover capital investments. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share and our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation and interest expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.29 per share. And lower AFUDC due to project timing, decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3% in 2019. We saw positive residential sales across almost all of our jurisdictions with continued customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. And in the C&I space, we experienced discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration and lower frac sand mining sales, which caused sales to be unfavorable. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.7% in 2019 as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer, partially offset by the declines in the frac sand mining demand in Wisconsin. For 2020, we anticipate electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. Turning to expenses. O&M costs were almost 1% lower than last year, driven by continued efficiency gains in our transmission and in our fossil and nuclear generation fleets, partially offset by unexpected storm costs and incremental spending on strategic areas to enhance the customer experience and further reduce risk in our operations. We remain committed to improving operating efficiencies and taking cost out of the business for the benefit of our customers, as we have for the past five years. And as a result, our consolidated base O&M forecast is essentially flat. However, we do expect incremental O&M from adding new wind generation in 2020 and 2021, which is largely rider recoverable as well as continuing to invest in strategic areas of cybersecurity, wildfire mitigation and enhancing the customer experience. As a result, we expect total O&M expense will increase approximately 1% to 2% in 2020. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In December, the Minnesota Commission approved our rate case stay out proposal, including the extension of the sales, capital and property tax true-up mechanisms, along with the deferral of increases in nuclear decommissioning costs. We view this as a constructive outcome as it will allow us to concentrate on other strategic Minnesota activities, including our integrated resource plan, our advanced grid initiative and electric vehicle expansion efforts. In January, the Minnesota Commission approved our affiliate filing for the Mankato natural gas plant and the assumption of the existing PPAs. We closed on the acquisition earlier this month, and believe the Mankato asset will bring substantial value and reliability to the Upper Midwest system and to our customers, especially as we retire additional coal plants. As we discussed in the past, we anticipate this asset will generate utility-like returns over its life. However, we expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast. We continue to progress – we continue the progress on our PPA acquisition strategy, and we are working with stakeholders to improve the process to ensure better regulatory alignment. We do not expect to propose future asset acquisitions into the unregulated company. Moving to Colorado. The commission held deliberations in our electric rate case in December and verbally approved an ROE of 9.3%, a current test year ended August 2019 and an equity ratio of 55.6%, along with other decisions. We view the support for strong capital structure and progress in improving the more current test year as positives, particularly for the credit support that they provide. But we're disappointed in a low ROE, which does not reflect our outstanding operational performance and leadership on the clean energy transition. We are waiting on a written commission order, which we need to calculate the final revenue impacts; however, we expect to seek reconsideration on certain issues. We expect new rates will be effective in February, 2020. We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. In New Mexico, we recently reached a constructive settlement that reflects a rate increase of approximately $31 million, an ROE of 9.45%, an equity ratio of 54.8% and an acceleration in depreciation in the top coal plant to reflect an early retirement. Hearings are scheduled in February with a commission decision to follow. In Texas, we're seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request largely reflects investment for the Hale wind project as well as other capital to support strong regional growth. Intervener testimony will be filed in February, and as in the past, we'll work to see if we can reach a settlement with the various parties. We anticipate a commission decision in the second quarter of 2020. We're planning to file several cases next year. In February, we will file a natural gas rate case in Colorado with new rates expected to be effective in November. We'll also consider filing a Colorado electric case in December. We intend to file a Minnesota electric case in November. And finally, we'll likely file rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico to recover the cost for the Sagamore wind project in the first quarter of 2021. With a strong year behind us, we are reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with the long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2019 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within or above our guidance range for the 15th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We issued $750 million of equity, representing the majority of our equity needs over the next five years. Our stock hit an all-time high in September and more recently, in January. We achieved a total shareholder return of just over 32%, eclipsing that TSR of the S&P 500 for yet another year. The Minnesota Commission approved our acquisition of the Longroad assets into rate base, and we put in service, three wind projects, largely on time and under budget. We resolved multiple rate cases, and we continue to demonstrate leadership in environmental, social and governance arenas. We remain well positioned to deliver on our 2020 earnings guidance range and our long-term earnings and dividend growth objectives of 5% to 7%. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: Thanks, good morning everybody.
Ben Fowke: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon: So, it doesn't look like there were any real substantive changes to your medium- to long-term outlook from your last disclosures. Your CapEx budget is the same, but you did slightly tweak some of your guidance drivers for 2020, including a modest reduction in the expected O&M growth. I guess I'm wondering, as you look in this year and then you look out over like a five-year planning horizon – you guys have done a great job, as you say it, bending the cost curve and controlling costs to reduce regulatory lag. And I'm just wondering – in general, I wonder about the industry, but also specifically with regard to Xcel, how – as you circle back around and look at your organization, how much leaner do you think you can get given improvements in technology and the cost of deploying renewables, et cetera?
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Greg, its Bob. It’s a great question. As we give guidance, we do expect modest increases in O&M over the next year or two as we bring the wind onto the system, and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigations. Over the longer term, we expect to keep O&M flat, probably beyond the 2021 period. And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers, looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that. So it's a continuous effort, but I think the guidance for us is flat in 2022 and beyond to what is 2021.
Greg Gordon: Great. Second and last question. I think tomorrow, we're expecting, unless things have changed, rate decisions in Texas for two of your competitors, CenterPoint and AEP. I know that you've got a pending case in that – where a decision is not expected until later this year. There's been concern about regulatory risk, both lower equity ratios and lower ROEs in that state. Centerpoint looks like they're coming out a little bit better than where they otherwise would have landed, but it's still not a great outcome relative to industry average. How do you think you guys differentiate?
Ben Fowke: Well, Greg, it's Ben. I think, historically, there's been a lot of differences in the pure T&D utility with no customers in ERCOT, like Centerpoint. And a vertically integrated company, like SPS, outside of ERCOT. And you see that we've been in front of the regulator numerous times in the last five years and the equity ratios are what they are as well as the ROE. So I think the more relevant case that I'd look to as I think about how Texas might get resolved, it's actually the settlement we had in New Mexico. As you know, Greg, many of the same interveners in Mexico are going to be the same ones in Texas. So we'll obviously look at those cases, but we're cautiously optimistic that we'll have some opportunities to potentially settle the Texas case in the March time frame of this year.
Greg Gordon: Fantastic. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Insoo Kim, Goldman Sachs.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is on the 2020 outlook for the – weather-adjusted load growth. Thank you for the color that you gave on what impacted, especially on the electric side, the weather-adjusted load. As you look out towards this year and just having gone through just a month of this year, does that still give you confidence that you could achieve the 1% increase in load, including the leap year impact?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Insoo, its Bob. Thanks for the question, and appreciate you on the call. I think our sales forecast is reasonably conservative. We did have some discrete declines in our large C&I customers in 2019 that we don't expect to continue in 2020. And underlying those discrete items, we do have strong customer growth, which is slightly moderated by use per customer. But I think our forecast is as expected, and we don't expect to adjust that from guidance.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you. And my second question. In Minnesota, with the ongoing discussions on the Clean Energy First, potential legislation. How did the latest discussions fit in with your overall timing and shape of fleet transformation that you've laid out in the RP? And do you see – and if there are changes, do you see potential opportunities or challenges relative to the original plan?
Ben Fowke: Well it’s a really good question. I think Clean Energy First basically codifies what we're already planning to do. And so this would be the second time that it was – where the state is looking to legislate that Clean Energy First legislation. And I think there will be some opportunities that come out of it. For us, it's important that we make sure we do this in the most efficient way possible. We recognize the very strong importance of our nuclear energy. And we recognize the fact that as we close and shut coal plants on a voluntary basis to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that our investors have some opportunities to be rewarded as well. So we'll see where it goes. We're going to move forward. We're filing our IRP plan, and that's, as you know, that's – so we've filed it, rather, and that will be discussed throughout the year. And it's – and I think it's a pretty extraordinary plan, which has a lot of renewables, some gas, the continuation of our nuclear plants. So I think we're well positioned.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
Ben Fowke: Hi, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, can you hear me?
Ben Fowke: Yes. Good morning.
Bob Frenzel: We can hear you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning. Thank you for the time. So perhaps just to follow up a little bit on the tax extenders' bill and some of the developments on the PTC. I know you guys are always vocal about your opportunities on the wind side. Can you elaborate your latest thinking on repowering specifically given the extension? And I know it's a little early, but just altogether, how do you think about the repowering opportunity in the PPA buyout strategy at large given the extension?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think it's helpful, and that's the short answer. The 60% PTC extension allows you to lock in technology through 2024 with a 60% PTC. So I think that will potentially create some more opportunities, to your point, for repowering, Julien. We – as you know, we don't have those opportunities embedded in our forecast, but we are certainly going to be looking for those opportunities.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then as you think towards the rate case in Minnesota, do you want to give any kind of premise as to how you think about that, again, obviously, being pushed out? But any parameters you think about in setting expectations going forward in that case, specifically? I know you just alluded to some potentially on the last question here, but maybe you just – to start to open up that conversation?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, we pushed it out a year, and I think the terms were constructive. We – unless we can figure out a way to push it out another year, we'll file in November, with interim rates to go into effect in January of, I guess, that would be 2021. So I don't really have much more details than that. We were pleased to work with the staff and stay out. I think that allows us to focus on the resource plan, and it's nice to be able to take a little burden off the staff too as they've got quite a workload. So could we stay out another year? Well, I don't know. But I guess, I can't add much more color than that, Julien. That's where we are.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: That is fair. All right, excellent. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Travis.
Travis Miller: Good morning. As you're looking in the industry, obviously, you're quite active, both solar and wind. 2020 and 2021, as you're negotiating contracts, both regulated and possibly the PPAs outside of those. What are you seeing just in terms of cost comparisons? Where costs are going, both wind and solar, are they still going down? Are they changing terms? Just wondering if you could characterize what you're seeing going 2020 and 2021, in wind and solar?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think you're still seeing the technologies fall in price. The – you then have to match that up with the – where we are with PTCs and ITCs. But as we just talked about, that 60% extension, I think, is going to be helpful. Without that 60% PTC extension, Travis, I would have told you that perhaps we'll see some bump up in wind, and we still might. And which is why I'm really pleased we locked down the 100%. I think that's a no-regret strategy in every sense of the word. But I think the technology is still going to compete head on with fossil alternatives, even in a low natural gas environment. Of course, the key that I think is important to that is that we will put more renewables on the big grid that we're all connected to than anybody else, but we're going to need more than just renewables and battery storage. Renewables will be our biggest source of energy by the mid-2020s. But as you see in our IRP in Minnesota, and we'll address this in Colorado next year, we're also going to need to back up that wind with natural gas. And then ultimately, we're going to need to start developing technologies, carbon-free dispatchable technologies that will allow us to achieve our goal of a zero percent carbon system by 2050. So maybe that's a little bit long-winded, but I thought I'd throw that out there for you, Travis. That's the plan. I will also add Travis, our industry is really, really stepping up to the challenge of carbon reduction. I mean we're proud to have been the first to establish the goal. But if you go down the line and add up what utilities are doing, it is really significant, and I'm quite proud of this industry.
Bob Frenzel: Yes, Travis, I'll add real quick. Our year-over-year fuel cost decline was about $325 million. And while half of that was just lower commodity prices, natural gas and coal, the rest of that is our steel-for-fuel program coming home to roost to the benefit of our customers. And while we are investing steel into the ground and have capital cases for recovery, you're seeing the real benefit on the fuel line. And that does accrete to the customers, and it provides some headroom in the bill for us for continued investments in the distribution and transmission grids, which we know we need.
Travis Miller: Yes, great. Thank you. And then did I hear you correctly, you do not plan on any unregulated renewable energy acquisitions, but you would possibly keep doing the PPA-type acquisitions? I – just to make sure there's not a change there from what you said.
Ben Fowke: So, our goal is to look for PPA buyout opportunities or repowering opportunities with the benefits flowing to the customers. So that means putting them in regulated operations and into rate base. That's always been the plan. Of course, we offer that as well for a gas fired plant in Mankato, and commission decided the benefits which were primarily back-end loaded weren't sufficient enough to go forward. So we made the decision that we would – the asset was important enough and we thought – valuable enough that we would hold it in our portfolio, but as a non-reg selling into the utility under long-term power purchase agreement. But I try to say you that more is an anomaly than anything else and I would challenge anybody to find a utility that is more focused and has more of their growth – 100% of their growth coming from regulated operations. There's nobody that's more pure play and vertically integrated than Xcel Energy, and that's the way we mean to keep it.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Ali.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Hi, good morning. First question, in 2019 as you noted in the slides, at the OpCo level you earned a 9.06% ROE. Can you just remind us what earned ROE is embedded in your 2020 guidance at the OpCo level?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Ali, its Bob. Our weighted average regulated ROE is about 9.4% across all of our jurisdictions and we still have approximately 50 basis points of leakage and lag in that. So high-8%s is probably a good number right now.
Ali Agha: I see. So, Bob you'd expect a little bit of leakage or a reduction from what 2019 ended up earning?
Bob Frenzel: I do mostly driven by a lower ROE in Colorado electric case. We're still working on trying to close that ROE gap, and we think we have some opportunity over the longer term to do that.
Ben Fowke: Ali, I think it's important to note, though, that we are – I will tell you, we are disappointed in the ROE we received in Colorado. But as Bob mentioned, there were some positive things there, too. But as you – as we're into the end of January, and we see the puts and takes that we've had so far, I would tell you that we are solidly positioned to be in the middle of our earnings guidance range.
Ali Agha: Okay. And secondly, I know your current 2020 through 2024 CapEx five year is roughly around $22 billion. And Ben, you alluded to looking at additional opportunities, whether it's renewables, et cetera, if they do arise. Just from a constraint perspective in terms of whether it's rate case, I mean, rate impact to customers or balance sheet, et cetera, how much can you stretch that $22 billion if there were opportunities? Or do you not see any constraints if the right opportunities are there?
Ben Fowke: Well, I don't – if the right opportunities are there, there are no constraints. And we're focused on CapEx that helps reduce total bills for our customers. And where we can find those opportunities, if it's a PPA buyout, that's great, if; it's trading O&M for capital, that's great; if it's more steel for fuel, that saves customers money on their fuel bill, more than offsets the capital cost and the associated return, that's great. We're always going to be looking for that. And longer term, I think we're in the early days of beneficial electrification and saving customers' money on their total energy bill with EVs and other opportunities.  So I'm excited about the capital opportunities we have to invest. And I think we've demonstrated we can grow our regulated rate base, again, it's 100% of where we get our earnings from and keep our bills flat for our customers.
Ali Agha: And last question. Again, a quick reminder. When you look at this 5% to 7% growth rate target that you laid out, can you remind us – as you stand here today and you look at the opportunities in the CapEx, are you comfortable in the upper half of that range, the higher end of that range? Can you just remind us where you stand on looking at that growth rate from where we are today?
Ben Fowke: Yes, I think we're positioned to be on the upper part of the range. I mean I'd.. 
Ali Agha: Upper part?
Ben Fowke: Yes. Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add?
Bob Frenzel: I agree with that.
Ali Agha: So, higher-end is the way we should think about it?
Ben Fowke: Yes.
Ali Agha: I, see. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Ali.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Sophie Karp of KeyBank.
Sophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Most of the topics have been discussed, I guess, but I just wanted to 
Paul Johnson: Sophie, there's a lot of background noise, we can hardly hear you.
Sophie Karp: Can you hear me now?
Paul Johnson: Much better.
Sophie Karp: Sorry about that. So most of the topics have been discussed, I guess, but I just wanted to circle back quickly on Colorado. Could you discuss where kind of the regulatory environment in the state is going directionally? I guess, with the disappointing rate decision and the initiative of – in Boulder, like, would it be fair to say, say, overall, it's getting more difficult, maybe or is it not a fair statement?
Ben Fowke: So I don't – I wouldn't categorize it that way. Boulder has been – we've been talking about Boulder for 10 years now and probably will be talking about it at least for another five. And that's more centric, I think, to Boulder, and we continue to, I think, do quite well on a legal basis there with supportive commission decisions as well. As far as the regulatory environment in Colorado, yes, I mentioned, Bob and I both did, we're disappointed in a 9.3% ROE. We think we're one of one of the best-performing utilities in the nation, and that ROE, quite frankly, doesn't reflect that. So likely look for reconsideration on that.  But longer term, Sophie, I believe that what we're doing – and what we're doing was codified in the law, last legislative session, we're highly aligned with what our customers and our stakeholders want to see in Colorado. And when I think about how you achieve long-term success, that's exactly how you do it, align with stakeholders and then execute on a crisp basis and that is what Xcel is doing, and I think that bodes well for future success. 
Sophie Karp: Terrific, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Levi of ExodusPoint.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Andy. How are you doing?
Andrew Levi: Was going to ask you about growth rate but I guess Ben, I just wanted to really to get your thoughts on – obviously, you've mentioned ESG and how it's kind of taking up a big – a big growing kind of the industry as far as how people are investing. But I guess another part that's been talked about relative to ESG is natural gas. And whether it's as in LDC, whether it's midstream, whether it's fracking, whether it's even using it in your power plant as the fuel. Ben, I just wanted to get your thoughts just on natural gas as a commodity and whether you think it's clean or dirty or – and then in the context of ESG, if you kind of agree with some people's view that it's a dirty fuel.
Ben Fowke: Yes. Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned. And early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan.  And we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a – this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%.  That's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're – but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix.  I will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So – and we've got of keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue, but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere there. 
Andrew Levi: Thank you, Ben. That was actually a great answer. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: Hey, good morning. How are you doing?
Ben Fowke: Hey, Paul.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Just really quickly on Ali Agha's questions, I just wanted to follow-up. Are you guys indicating that you – in general – just to make sure I understand it that you don't expect any rate increases, when everything is factored into a fuel and everything else, with respect to your regulatory objectives of your CapEx objectives?
Ben Fowke: No, Paul. I hope I didn't give that impression. I mean our goal is to keep our total bills to customers at or below the CPI index. And if you look back on some of our – and look in our investor deck, you can see that we've done that over the last five years. Now what – the other – you will see increases as well in the KWH rate but remember, that's only one component of a total bill. So we're really focused on keeping bills, again, CPI or less as we go through this time frame.  And our analysis says we can with the right deployment of technology and supportive public policy. That's really important because you can also make it much more expensive than it needs to be. But – and That's where we are.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And is there any thought about maybe going to sort of PBR, sort of a CPI minus x or something like that if that's sort of the objective maybe. And maybe not have all these sort of rate cases and rate proceedings?
Ben Fowke: You mean like change the regulatory compact for something around that?
Paul Patterson: It's not the regulatory compact so much it's just the regulatory – I mean you guys are going in all the time for rate increases or rate cases, if you follow me, and they're kind of – you seem to know more about it than I do, they can be kind of tactical and what have you. In some places around – in some jurisdictions internationally, you have something like a CPI minus x, where basically – it's a sort of performance-based rate making sort of thing, where your rates do – where inflation is taken into account in terms of where your rates are set periodically. I don't know. I was – just was wondering if there's any thought about something like that or...
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, we're always open to new ideas, but I think you have to be pretty cautious when you start addressing those sorts of things, Paul. And we do file a number of cases and – that we spent a lot of time on calls like this, talking about it, but we've got a great track record of managing that. And we've got, I think, a very good track record of aligning with policymakers, which, again, on a long-term basis, gets you where you need to be. So in my experience, some of those mechanisms aren't necessarily good for the companies that have them – that have those in place. They can be, but they can also be harmful as well. 
Paul Patterson: Sure. Sure. I was wondering if there's any thought about that. That's all. I don't – I just – just hearing it, I just thought I'd ask that. That's all.
Ben Fowke: Performance-based ratemaking is great, but sometimes it's not symmetrical, I guess. So that's – so we're pretty pragmatic about that.
Paul Patterson: Absolutely. And then in terms of – there's been some questions about, as you know, coal and coal dispatch and you guys made your filing in December in Minnesota. I'm just wondering if going forward, you see additional activity in that? Or anything that you guys are looking at in terms of coal plant retirement? Any sort of flexibility that might be worked into, in terms of potential additional savings that might be enhanced by – I know you guys are looking at it all the time, but in terms of coal plant retirements or dispatch changes that might also drive savings for customers or for you. How should we think about that? I mean, is there anything – any – other than what you guys have been doing for some time now, is there any additional sort of things on the horizon?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, first of all, thank you for recognizing what we do with our coal plants up here. I mean I think that working with the commission here, I thought that was a great example of partnership. And moving from must run to economic dispatch, I think that was a positive first step. The commission is very interested in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don't have any coal in the upper Midwest. So I think it's – the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward.  And to your point Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants particularly when you look at the variable costs of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we're definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch. So, again, with economics in mind, so – yeah, it does look for us – to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the upper Midwest.
Paul Patterson: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Ben Fowke: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks.
Bob Frenzel: Well, thanks everyone for participating in our call this morning. We look forward to seeing you out on the road this quarter. Please contact our Investor Relations teams with any follow-up questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to investor relations. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2019 third quarter results, discuss earnings guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and also update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric and natural gas margins. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. Let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared to $0.96 per share last year. Three quarters of the year behind us, we are on track to deliver earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. Consistent with our third quarter tradition, we have updated our investment plan, which now reflects $22 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years. This represents rate base growth of 6.7%, off of 2019 base year. Our updated capital forecast is, of course, driven by our investment in renewables as we continue the clean energy transition. The forecast also includes investment in our advanced grid initiatives, expenditures to improve the customer experience, additional investment in the transmission system to maintain asset health and reliability and a natural gas combined cycle plant at our Sherco facility to ensure reliability as we retire coal plants. This represents a base capital forecast and we are also confident that there are likely additional upside investment opportunities not included in this base plan. We are also initiating 2020 guidance of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% long term EPS growth objective. We are very excited about our plan, which provides customer value, delivers attractive returns for investors and keep customer bills low. Next, let me update you on our PPA buyouts and wind projects. In September, the Minnesota Commission denied our proposal to acquire the Mankato combined cycle plant as a rate base asset. Over its life, we believe the Mankato asset brings tremendous value and reliability to the system, especially as we retire coal plants. As a result, we have filed to acquire Mankato as a non-regulated asset and assume the existing PPAs with NSP-Minnesota, which runs through 2026 and 2039. We anticipate the acquisition will generate utility like returns over the life of the asset. However, we expect that non-regulated returns will be lower in the near term as the benefits are back-end loaded. We made wholesale generation filings at FERC and affiliate interest filings with the Minnesota Commission and we expect approval in December or January. We believe that our PPA buyout strategy can provide significant customer benefits. As a result, we will continue to evaluate customer beneficial acquisition opportunities and will proactively work with our stakeholders to identify the cost and benefits of the transaction. Please note, our capital forecast does not include any incremental PPA acquisition. Our two proposed wind PPA acquisitions, Longroad and Mower, produce significant savings for our customers and these benefits are front-end loaded as the PTCs would flow back to customers in the first 10 years. We expect the Minnesota Commission decision on Longroad by the end of the year and Mower in the first half of 2020. We continue to achieve important milestones in our nation-leading wind expansion. We have completed the development phase of our 522 megawatts Sagamore wind project in New Mexico with construction slated to begin later this year and commercial operation expected by the end of 2020. In the upper Midwest, a developer scaled back the Crowned Ridge wind project by 200 megawatts due to increased MISO transmission and interconnection cost. We had planned on 100 megawatts at Crowned Ridge as a build-own-transfer project. While this has an immaterial impact on our capital forecast, it does highlight the need to expand transmission investment to address congestion and ensure the viability of future renewable projects. So as a result, we, like The Blues Brothers, are on a mission to put the band back together again and we are working with the original CapEx 2020 utilities built over $2 billion of transmission projects in the Upper Midwest over the last 10 years. We expect similar constraints in investment opportunities in SPP in Colorado as well. While not in our five-year forecast and it will take some time to develop and implement plans, the need for additional transmission highlights the long runway for capital investment for Xcel Energy. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob. He will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Bob Frenzel: Thanks Ben and good morning everyone. We recorded third quarter earnings of $1.01 per share compared with $0.96 per share in 2018. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and riders to recover our capital investment. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And lower AFUDC due to projects going into service decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, offset by lower use per customer and expected discrete declines in certain large customer usage due to cogeneration. Year-to-date weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 3.2% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate relatively flat electric sales and natural gas sales growth of 2% to 3% growth, reflecting year-to-date performance. Turning to O&M. And consistent with our expectations, our quarterly expenses decreased by $13 million, reflecting lower cost in our nuclear and fossil plant operations. For year-to-date, O&M expenses are above last year, largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs. We expect lower cost for nuclear operations and fossil plant outages in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, we increased O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. Accordingly, we expect our full year 2019 O&M expenses will decline by 15 to 2% from 2018 levels. Now let me provide a quick regulatory update. Earlier this month, we filed rebuttal testimony in our Colorado electric rate case and revised our request. We are now seeking an increase of $108 million based on the current test year with a capital reach forward through June 19 and an equity ratio of 55.7% and an ROE of 10.2%. Interveners filed testimony and the commission staff recommended an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 55.6% in a current test year with a capital reach forward through June 2019 with an average rate base. Hearings start November and we expect a Commission decision in December with new rates effective January 2020. We also have electric rate cases in New Mexico and Texas. SPS is seeking an increase of $51 million in New Mexico, based on a historic test year with a capital reach forward and an equity ratio of 54.8% and an ROE of 10.35%. While in Texas, SPS is seeking an increase of $136 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.7% and an ROE of 10.35%. The requests largely reflect investments for the Hale Wind Project as well as other capital to support strong growth in the region. Both cases are in the discovery phase with not much to report. As a reminder, both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a certificate of need and current recovery mechanisms for Hale. We anticipate final rates going into effect in 2020. Turning to earnings guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we are narrowing our 2019 earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share, which represents the upper half of the original guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. As Ben noted, we are initiating our 2020 earnings guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83 per share, which is consistent with our long term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%. Please note that the 2020 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of items. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect electric and natural gas sales growth of approximately 1%, which includes the impact of leap year. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, largely driven by wind production tax credits which are credited to customers and have no impact on earnings. Finally, we expect O&M expenses to increase 2%, which reflects increased cost for new wind projects coming online. Please note, wind O&M is recovered and riders in most jurisdiction is offset by fuel savings. In our earnings release, you will find more details about our updated $22 billion, five-year capital forecast which reflects investments to support continued customer growth, improvements in safety and reliability, the enablement of renewable generation and automated metering for our customers. The capital plan results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 6.7% using 2019 as a base. Importantly, the rate base growth rate would be 7.3%, if we would maintain 2018 as the base year. Our updated capital investment plan is supportive of our 5% to 7% long term earnings growth objective and our goal to deliver EPS and dividend growth in the upper half of the range. We have also updated our financing plan which reflects a combination of internal cash generation and operating company and holding company debt to finance the majority of our capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to issue $1 billion of incremental market equity over the next three years and $400 million of DRIP and benefits equity to fund our capital plan and support our credit ratings. The financial plan reflects incremental capital investments of approximately $2.5 billion for the period of 2022 to 2023 as compared with our previous capital forecast. This incremental equity will allow us to fund accretive capital investment opportunities, which benefit our customers while maintaining our solid credit metrics and favorable access to the capital markets. With that, I will wrap up. We are continuing to make progress on our wind development efforts in our PPA buyout strategy with the recently announced Mower project. We are going forward with the Mankato acquisition due to the strong value the asset provides over the long term. We are well-positioned to deliver earnings in the upper half of our 2019 earnings guidance range. We have announced a robust updated capital investment program, which provides strong transparent rate base growth and customer value. We have initiated 2020 EPS guidance of $2.73 to $2.83, which is consistent with our long term objective. Finally, we are very confident that we can deliver long term EPS growth in the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will take a few questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Greg Gordon: Thanks. Great outlook guys. Just a couple questions. You have got a lot of rate cases pending. And when you think about the range of potential outcomes in terms of things that might influence financial results like return on equity, how do you sort of flex for that when you think about the guidance range? And do you contemplate with interest rates this low that the direction of travel on ROEs might still be modestly lower than where we are today?
Ben Fowke: I think, Greg, that's a great question. I mean we do recognize that we have some modest risk for which we have incorporated into our range. I think we got a lot of things going for us. First of all, we are very much aligned with our commissions on what we are doing with the clean energy transition. It's good to have their support with that. I think second of all, if you think about it, we certainly don't have above market ROEs today. And then finally, if you look at some data points on some of the cases that we have decided recently, they kind of point to a reasonable ROE. So we always know we don't everything we ask for, of course. And I think we are very comfortable with the guidance we have set for us.
Greg Gordon: Okay. That was my only question. Thank you. Have a great day.
Ben Fowke: Thanks Greg.
Operator: Moving on, we will hear from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.
Ben Fowke: Good morning Chris.
Christopher Turnure: Good morning Ben and Bob. Increasing transmission investment is a little bit of a newer theme for you guys or kind of a return to maybe an older theme. Just wondering if there is higher risk to this plan due to size of projects being larger or regulatory approvals that are needed here? And I know your renewable investments really tail off in the next two or three years, but I guess, to the degree that you are successful here, is there kind of upside to those renewables numbers?
Ben Fowke: Well, that's two parts to the question. I guess as the last part, we don't have any renewables scheduled because we try to sync up that renewable portfolio with our IRP plan. And as you know, Chris, we expect to retire coal plants in the mid-2020s and that's when this next round of renewables, which will be very significant, will come through. One of the benefits we have had with our Steel for Fuel program is, we have created headroom on the consumer bills to do more investment in grid infrastructure and the investment we are talking about, Chris, isn't really going to require the regulatory approval because it's not the big transmission lines I referred to when I said we are getting the band back together again. This is asset health. This is the reliability. And this is to support some of the renewables that we already have out there.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. That's good to hear. And then the incremental $1 billion of equity needs are technically over the five-year plan. Can you kind of give us a sense as to the timing and maybe structure of that within the five-year range?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Chris, in my prepared remarks I mentioned we would probably do it over the next three years and historically the company has looked at a bunch of different products. We have used ATM programs. We have used block deals in the past. I think we look at a various mix of products. I think it will come in obviously more than one offering. And so I just think we will be measured about it and we will execute it in line with our cash needs as we look forward over the next three years.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. Thanks for that guys.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: And next up, we will take a question from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Ali Agha: Ben, I may have missed it right at the opening but when you look at that $22 billion five-year CapEx, obviously you roll forward. So it's not apples-to-apples with your last five-year. But even for the years that are complete in both, what's the main upside to the numbers? And in the past, you have talked about your base plan and then you have laid out, quantified your upside plan et cetera. This time, it looks like everything is in one plan. So are all of these projects now approved and ready to go? Or are there certain placeholders in this $22 billion number.
Ben Fowke: I think for the most part, this is stuff we know we can execute on. As I mentioned with the previous call, the transmission and distribution spend, those are things that are really the normal course of business. And we have a lot of opportunities to invest in our grid. I have always said, as you know, that those sorts of investments are always capped at the willingness for the consumer to pay. So to the extent we can do things like Steel for Fuel and our efficiency initiatives and take advantage of falling commodity prices, you create that headroom. So we are quite confident in the $22 billion. Now I think your second part was and correct me if I am wrong, you wanted to know about upsides in the capital forecast?
Ali Agha: Yes. I guess it was kind of two-part as well. One, in your existing $22 billion, what has gone up versus what you were thinking when you had last put out your CapEx? And then this time you don't have like a base case, upside case. So is everything now all in one plan?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Ali, this is Bob. I think that's the right way to think about it. We recognize that in the back years of our plan, we may have structurally under-forecasted some items. And I think we spent a lot of time with the operations in the businesses this year looking at their asset needs and trying to get everything into a single plan to make it simple and easy for the investor to understand. So I think what you are seeing here is the compilation of probably six months worth of good work by the company trying to identify projects in the back part of the plan that maybe might not have gotten identified in previous plans. So I think we have melded base and what we may have historically called upside or unidentified. I do think though and I think Ben was going to comments on upside and I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned one which is a continuation of our PPA buyout strategy. We think we have got 10,000, 11,000 megawatts of PPAs that the company procures today from third-party owners and we still think that there is opportunities out there to find customer beneficial acquisitions. None of that's included in the $22 billion.
Ali Agha: Got you.
Ben Fowke: And it's clear while renewables that we put into our capital forecast usually come out of a IRP process, we believe there might be some opportunities to add some renewables still but just not identified yet which is why they are upside.
Ali Agha: Got you. And one other question. When I look at your weather normalized sales trends broken out on a quarterly pattern, third quarter we saw a pretty big negative. You had been trending positive through the first two quarters on the electric sale side. So anything that has changed that caused the negative run in the third quarter?
Ben Fowke: I will take a stab at it and maybe Bob will augment it. First of all, when we have had good quarters, we tell you don't think that as a trend. When we have a little bit off, we tell you don't take that as trend. But we did know, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, that we did have some of C&I customers that were self generating through cogen, et cetera. And that was planned. We knew about it. So that's the big issue there.
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Ali, the only thing I would add to it is, we have seen some softness in the sand mining industry and fracing in Wisconsin, some of that attributable to competing products around the country and some softness in the gas markets broadly.
Ali Agha: Got you. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. Okay. So one question. In you prepared remarks, you didn't mention anything about a potential settlement in your Colorado rate case. Should we still expect it? I see that there is an October 30 deadline for filing. Could you comment on that?
Ben Fowke: Well, listen, the time that we would get entering the settlement discussions, Angie, would be after rebuttal. So that's the period now and there has been some outreach and some work being done but we don't have anything to report to you or we would. And as you know, it's scheduled for hearing, I think, in thinking the first week of November. So maybe something will come up in that timeframe. But if we have something to report, we would tell you.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And secondly, this Mankato acquisition on a non-regulated basis, at least caught me by surprise. And you are mentioning those buyouts of existing renewable PPAs. Would those be also unregulated? Or are you talking about basically converting PPAs into rate base renewables?
Ben Fowke: Well, our approach is always going to be, let's find customer beneficial acquisition opportunities through PPAs and let's offer them to our customers. And so our plan is always to put them in rate base. In the case of Mankato, the department and ultimately the commission decided that the benefits were too back-end loaded, some variances in how we modeled those benefits and they decided that they didn't want it in rate base. However, we still believe it's a very valuable asset and that it belongs in our portfolio. So we went forward with a non-regulated base approach. But Angie, this isn't a change in strategy or anything else. We always want to see this. We wouldn't bring something to our commissions that we didn't think had a customer benefit. If there's disputes along the way, then we have to adjust to that depending on the situation. But that's always going to be Plan B, not Plan A.
Bob Frenzel: Angie, these are all still long-dated PPA contracts from the asset to one of our regulated operating companies, in this case NSP-M. So we do like the credit counterparty. We do like the optics of the transaction. I think it works for shareholders and customers alike. And so you should expect us to move forward with the Mankato one. On the wind projects, our preference is to own them in rate base. I think they are really beneficial for the customers. But if they don't, we have made a preemptive filing at FERC to move those to wholesale as well. But again, as Ben said, I don't this is a strategic shift. It's just a recognition of their good assets that serve our customers and we are willing to own them.
Ben Fowke: Yes. And we still see plenty of opportunities, as Bob previously mentioned, to find those PPA buyout opportunities. And of course, we are in eight states, not just one or two. So they are across all of our jurisdictions.
Angie Storozynski: It's just that and I obviously accept your explanation. It's just that in a sense, you are acting as a financial investor here and typically when we see these types of acquisitions, contract base to what's seemingly similar economics, at least I would take it as a sign that you are running out of growth options in the regulated base because that's a superior growth profile, at least from a risk perspective. And I understand that Mankato could be a one-off. But you are basically saying that that's not the case here, that that was just an exceptional situation here?
Ben Fowke: Well, Angie, I have to tell you, I think we have the most transparent growth of our organic system which is the $22 billion that we put forth and we think even beyond the forecast period, we will continue to see excellent opportunities to grow the system. We are create headroom with things like Steel for Fuel to keep bills low so that we can make those investments and not overburden customers. I think that's a very important consideration. The PPA buyout strategies which is pure upside to a very robust base capital plan. And this is not a strategic change. You are not going to see us look for opportunities to come in as a financial investor. This is situation where we had some modeling differences on the benefits. Bob mentioned, we have two other wind proposals in front of the commission. The difference there is, these benefits are very much front-end loaded. And I think there is a preference in Minnesota to own renewables over gas. So we will see where that goes. But again, I think we are quite proud of the pure play vertically integrated regulated utility we are.
Angie Storozynski: Awesome. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you Angie.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Ben Fowke: Hi Steve.
Steve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning. Just could you just may be talk a little bit more on what is happening with the MISO transmission situation on renewables and how congested it is? And just what is needed in your region to have renewables up more reasonable cost access?
Ben Fowke: Well, the work we did with CapEx 2020 opened up the door for a lot of renewables, but it's starting, to your point, to get constrained. And I do think long term, we are going to need more transmission development in the region to make sure we can continue to see renewables come into the MISO market. That said, Steve, I think we have some opportunities in the interim to squeeze out, if you will, the transmission capacity that is available and we are looking at those opportunities. And of course, some of the transmission that we are building in the next two years will help with that as well.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Is this something where you can kind of expand transmission on existing footprints? Or you need you get access to kind of new areas?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think certainly there is obviously a lot of work done with the new FERC rules on how that relates to existing transmission and repurposing and I think there will be some opportunities in the market around that.
Steve Fleishman: Okay.
Bob Frenzel: And I think, Steve, longer term, this is a longer term issue that we are working on and Ben said we are getting the band back together, CapEx 2020 was a very successful consortium of transmission owners in MISO that came together and formulate a plan and executed on very successfully. I think that that group is back together. They put out a press release on it three, four weeks ago trying to come up with solutions in partnership with MISO for longer term transmission access. And this is going to be probably not in our current capital plan but more like in years five through 15 where we are going to see much more regional. We expect to see more regional transmission to enable exactly what you are talking about.
Ben Fowke: It does sync up very nicely to our plans to retire coal plants. So our emphasis, particularly on MISO, will be more heavily towards solar which leads the initial tranches which have a better planning capacity, Steve, if you will than wind, which is by far the best energy type source.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the Colorado case, I think the settlement timeline is really in the next like week or two and it sounds like you can't really talk about whether you are going to be able to settle or not. But if we don't see something by then, should we then assume you are probably not going to be able to settle?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think you have the timeframe right. So time for settlement is right after rebuttal but before hearing. So we have got that week or two window to try to get something done. If I had something definitive to report, I would. But I don't want you to think that we are not interested in pursuing a settlement.
Ben Fowke: Steve, there is a real benefit to the settlement, but there is also from a timing perspective, the hearings are first week in November. Commission decision is expected in December and new rates in January. So the timeline is relatively compressed anyway in terms of when we go from hearing to final rates. So the clock itself is not a driver.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning team.
Ben Fowke: Hi Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, howdy. Perhaps if I can just follow-up on the last set of questions just real quickly on the MISO transmission piece. Interconnection queue issues have been around and accelerating of late. It sounds like you guys are really working on this. Can you talk a little bit about the timeline? You talk about this transmission 2020 effort. MISO is talking about MVP again. We have heard this from other peer utilities. Can you elaborate a little bit on what this process would look like, whether at MISO or with your peers and that process? Again you talk about the five to 15 year plan. But even more tangibly in the planning process in the next 12 months, how does this play out?
Bob Frenzel: I think there is still a bit of uncertainty, Julien, around the MISO transmission planning process. We are obviously a large transmission owner of MISO and are participating with them in the process. Our own group, I will call it the CapEx 2020 group, getting back together is still in its early days in terms of identifying timelines for engineering studies and how this might progress. I don't think this is a very quick process. I think this is going to take at least five years through planning before we start getting into real capital plans and construction timeframes. And so I don't want to suggest that something is going to change in the next year 12 to 18 months in terms of congestion in the MISO region. And we are seeing similar stuff in SPP as well in terms of just congestion and queues being backed up and projects being assessed with significant upgrade costs.
Ben Fowke: And Julien, remember when this does get built, we have pretty attractive right of first refusal legislation in some of our key states. So we are excited about the opportunities at the bill transmission. And without getting too specific in the details, we do see some opportunities to utilize existing transmission and other existing queue access to not slow down our plan in the meantime.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And if I can go back to the Mankato stuff just with respect to the fuel type. I suppose my initial reaction was thinking that this might be more of a gas versus renewable question. Can you talk or elaborate a little bit more about the context behind this decision? Obviously I think Angie said it before, she was surprised. How would you characterize it? Is there any specific angle here to be focused on in terms of understanding this decision versus the others proposed?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, it's just the weighing of the benefits. I think renewables definitely have a preference with our commission than gas, but I think it also comes down to the modeling and we are working with the department to make sure we have a more consistent modeling approach as we go into the IRP process. I think that's important, Julien. But let me just step back, the IRRs of Mankato are good for shareholders. We think we would prefer to have Mankato owned by our customers because that's always our first preference and that's our core strategy. But we didn't want to walk away from this asset. We want it in the portfolio. And so I think shareholders will benefit and we will see what the, I am not going to speculate on what the commission does with our wind projects, but I will tell you that we are comfortable with ownership, prefer ownership on the regulated side, but it's not bad in a portfolio either. And remember, when Bob talks about 10,000 megawatts, they are across all eight states. And it just so happens, these initial PPA buyouts came in Minnesota. But remember, we had Calpine in Colorado before and there are other opportunities in other states. And I just want to reiterate and I hope I am answering your question, we are not having a strategic change. We are definitely focused on the great organic growth opportunities we have as a regulated utility in the Upper Midwest all the way down to Texas.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Awesome. All right. Well, thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Up next, we will hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Hi Travis.
Travis Miller: Hi. So just to stick on that subject real quick here on the PPA buyouts and potential growth there. Would you do the financing structure any different in terms of ParentCo versus project versus utility?
Bob Frenzel: Hi Travis, this is Bob. I think our base plan is to finance at the parent company with a mix of parent company, holding company debt and equity. I think our long term capital structure is the right way to look at any of these assets. So 60/40 debt to equity ratio is how we think about financing the business.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. And then I wonder if you could talk both on a holistic basis across the industry and then also what you guys are seeing in terms of the PTCs, how those and ITC for the solar parts in that 2022 to 2024 time period? How do we fill in those holes and think about those tax credits if the tax policy stays the same for you guys and for the industry broadly?
Ben Fowke: Well, that's a great question. It's one of the reasons why we accelerated and really put the pedal down on our Steel for Fuel program and the biggest wind expansion in the country that we have now because we did want to lock in those PTC credits before they expired at the 100% level and even at the 80% level. You are right. I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll-off. Of course, there is a chance they won't. Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC or most of it anyway will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself and we think that times of very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-2020. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we will clearly wait to see if there is legislation, et cetera might change that.
Travis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick, a follow-up. I know you guys and a lot of other companies have been talking about solar has been exiting, a lot of solar investment. Being a little extreme here, but what saves the wind beyond 2022 and 2023?
Ben Fowke: Well, first of all, I think wind will recover and will be attractively priced. And I think wind will always compete very nicely against solar on an energy basis. And I think you will find as more and more solar that comes on the system, the planning capacity might fall off a little bit. So I think wind is always going to be there. We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we are retiring our coal plants. Solar has some advantages. Just think about it, I had farmers come up to me and say, gosh, you know, if we get we didn't have a wind farm on our land, we might have gone under. So you still farm the land when you have a wind project going there. Solar, not so much. I mean you basically the land is being repurposed. And then, of course, there are different characteristics with when the wind blows versus when the sun shines. And so I think the two will complement each other in our clean energy transition very nicely. And I think there is going to wind indefinitely.
Travis Miller: Okay. Great. I appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.
Ben Fowke: Just one comment on that too. You have got to remember, we are in the wind belt of the United States. So it's one of the reasons why our Steel for Fuel strategies work so well. And so we are always going to have that inherent advantage.
Travis Miller: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.
Ben Fowke: Good morning Paul.
Paul Fremont: Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse to death, but when you revised your ask in Colorado, does that improve, in your mind, the possibility of reaching settlement in that case?
Ben Fowke: Yes. The short answer is yes.
Paul Fremont: Okay.
Ben Fowke: Look, if you look at what we are asking for in the case, you look at what we did with rebuttals, we have a distinct possibility, but possibilities versus something I can talk to you about explicitly, we are not there.
Paul Fremont: Okay. And then I guess a couple of questions on the CapEx revision. I am assuming for 2019 that the number that you previously had would come down by $650 million for Northern States Power because of the Mankato acquisition would be done through sort of an non-regulated entity. Is that fair?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. Paul, this is Bob. For the rate base assumption, that's correct. But for the capital assumption, we are still going to spend the capital to procure that asset.
Paul Fremont: Right. So it would like go to other, right, I would assume?
Bob Frenzel: Correct.
Paul Fremont: Okay.
Bob Frenzel: That's the way to think about it.
Paul Fremont: And then it looks like there is a $735 million pickup for Northern States Power Minnesota in 2020. Can you sort of give us what's driving that?
Bob Frenzel: I think the largest driver of that is sort of wind movements across plan years. So previously we were going to have a build-own-transfer project with our Cheyenne wind project. We are going to build that ourselves. And we moved a bunch of that capital into 2019 to get it built in time for 100% PTC. In 2020, some of the wind has moved from 2019 into 2020. And so that's probably the bigger pickup in the NSPM territory. In total, capital for 2019 is expected to be in line with our original guidance of $5.1 billion.
Paul Fremont: And then there is another sort of big pickup of almost $1 billion in your spend in 2022. Can you give us some ideas as to what's driving that?
Bob Frenzel: I think big picture, Ben talked about a lot of that and it's a lot of investments in our network for the transmission, distribution and gas networks. That's big spend year for us for our advanced grid initiatives. And that's when we start spending additional dollars in the gas networks as well. So again, we spent a lot of money in renewables over the last three or four years. We have created a significant amount of customer bill headroom and we are starting to look at the networks businesses a little more carefully and we have seen both need and opportunity there.
Paul Fremont: Great. I think that's it in terms of questions.
Operator: And our next question will come from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Sophie Karp: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, I was just wondering about Minnesota and following the Mankato docket and I think you have a rate case there coming up. Is your regulatory strategy is changing in that state? Is there any consideration that maybe you would approach differently?
Ben Fowke: No, I don't think so. We plan to file for interim rates in the first week of November. I don't see anything too controversial with that. We expect the rates to go into place. And then we will process the case. I am not sure, we still see the same alignment with our strategy and we expect a constructive outcome. So that answers your question, Sophie. I want to make sure I did.
Sophie Karp: Yes. So it sounds like you don't expect your Mankato acquisition that you are now doing as merchant asset to color the rate case proceeding in anyway?
Ben Fowke: No, not at all. No, there is no strained relationship at all around that. It's just a difference of the commission deciding we don't think there is enough benefit. We think there was a lot of benefit and still do. But no reflection upon strain in the relationship.
Sophie Karp: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: Hi. Good morning. How are you doing.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Paul Patterson: So I wanted to touch base with you on the transmission. As you know, there have been some voices concerned the cost containment and what have you in that area. And we have recently had FERC put out an order and some comments as well, I guess, from certain commissioners about the FERC Order 1000 really hasn't worked out as they thought it would in terms of providing the level of competition that they wanted to. And so, I was just wondering if you could sort of talk about how you see that issue or those issues related to competition in transmission? And I think it was last week, we had a FERC order as well associated with touching on this as well. How we should think about what the outlook might be with respect to this reported concern?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think that's a really good question. I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we are trying to get accomplished, is not about the competitive process In fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how cost would be allocated because the real barriers to getting transmission build is, who pays for it and then of course the permitting and everything else that goes with that. So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it and it's not necessary and we will see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we have got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We are not an RTO in Colorado. I think there is some real advantages to that. But we will get this transmission built. And we are being realistic in the time it takes to get it built.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we will hear from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital.
Ben Fowke: Hi Vedula.
Vedula Murti: Just wanted to follow-up little bit on the Mankato discussion we are having. You referenced the strong internal IRRs. How does it compete in terms of just picking more from capital allocation perspective versus other capital opportunities you have across the system in terms of choosing this capital allocation?
Ben Fowke: Well, the Mankato project is certainly, the returns are certainly above our cost of capital and an attractive from a shareholders' perspective as a result. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?
Bob Frenzel: No. I think the expectations over the life of the asset, it looks like our utility like return are consolidated corporate returns. We have stated that it's a little bit lower on the front-end and a little bit higher on the back-end, just given the structure of the contracts. But otherwise, I agree with Ben's comments.
Ben Fowke: Let me just add that when we talk about utility like returns over the life, that is with very, in our opinion, very conservative modeling. I do think that the trend towards anti-gas makes existing gas assets valuable. And we are retiring coal plants and we are keenly focused on reliability. So Vedula, we really thought it was important to keep it in our portfolio because I think that the value of existing gas assets is only going to grow and this is a CC plant that we modeled very, very conservatively. So it's reason why we did not want to walk away from this one.
Vedula Murti: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel for closing remarks.
Bob Frenzel: Thank you very much for your participation in our call today. As always, if you have any questions, please follow-up with investor relations.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2019 second quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, electric margin and natural gas margin. Information on comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.46 per share compared to $0.52 per share last year. Our year-to-date earnings are on track, and we are well positioned to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. Bob will walk you through the favorable timing differences in the second half of the year in a few minutes, but we are very confident that we will deliver on our financial objectives as we have in the past. So let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In July, we filed our Upper Midwest resource plan, which runs through 2034. Our preferred plan, which is supported by a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups, includes the following key points: the early retirement of coal plants, starting with King in 2028, followed by Sherco 3 in 2030. By the end of 2030, we will have completely exited coal in the Upper Midwest. The plan also calls for an extension of the life of the Monticello nuclear plant from 2030 to 2040. It includes the acquisition of Mankato combined cycle natural gas facility and the construction of a combined cycle natural gas plant at Sherco site. The plant adds an additional 4,000 megawatts of solar and 1,200 megawatts of wind to replacement. Finally, we will also add 1,700 megawatts of firm peaking capacity post the 2030 time frame. Our preferred plan would result in an 80% carbon reduction by 2030 and puts NSP on a path to be 100% carbon-free by 2050. We are excited by the opportunity to create a cleaner sustainable energy future for our customers. We also continue to make strong progress on our steel-for-fuel strategy. In June, our 478-megawatt Hale Wind farm went into service in Texas. The project was completed on time and under budget. Our customers will see substantial savings over its life. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction, and we expect they will be completed between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. The legislative sessions are now completed in our states, and there were some important laws that were passed. In Texas, 3 bills passed: a bill that provides the right of first refusal on new transmission projects; a bill that provides right of recovery for new generation; and a bill that provides right of recovery for AMI investment. These bills point to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. In Colorado, legislation passed that classified our plans to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and an 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill provides for voluntary securitization as an option and targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation. Also in Colorado, a bill passed that allows us to own EV infrastructure. Finally, in New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was passed. This rule targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We are well positioned to meet the 2030 milestone. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transition, and the bills I discussed are consistent with our carbon-reduction objectives and reflect our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. Finally, I'm proud to announce that Xcel Energy has been named to the 2019 Military Times Best for Vest Employers ranking. This is the 6th straight year we've received this honor. In 2013, we set a goal to have 10% of new hires to be veterans, and the company has reached that goal every year. Xcel Energy currently employs more than 1,000 veterans, nearly 10% of our workforce. It's an honor to have these men and women in our workforce. Our veterans bring strong leadership, teamwork and experience to their job; their dedication and passion for service deliver value for our customers every day. So now I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel, who's a Navy vet, to provide you more detail on the quarterly results and regulatory plans. Bob?
Robert Frenzel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We recorded second quarter earnings or $0.46 per share compared with $0.52 per share in 2018. The 2019 results reflect $0.05 of adverse weather impact on the quarterly comparison. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.09 per share, including various regulatory outcomes and writers to recover our capital investments, which was partially offset by $0.05 per share of unfavorable weather. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.03 per share. However, the majority of the lower ETR is due to an increase in production tax credits, which flow back to customers through electric margin, and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation, interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. And higher O&M expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share. Turning to sales. Our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.4%, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use per customer. Year-to-date weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 3% as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we anticipate slightly favorable consolidated electric sales, which reflects some of the favorable year-to-date sales and some discrete known declines in large customer usage and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we've increased our 2019 sales guidance to 2% to 3% growth to reflect strong year-to-date performance. Turning to O&M. Our quarterly expenses increased by $8 million, reflecting storm costs, natural gas pipeline maintenance and increased IT spend to modernize our business systems that support our strategy to enhance the customer experience. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are above last year largely due to expense timing but also due to higher-than-expected storm costs in 2019. We expect lower plant outage in nuclear operation cost in the second half of 2019. And as a reminder, we increased our O&M spending in the second half of 2018 due to the impact of hot weather as well as incurring costs for environmental remediation and business efficiency improvements. Accordingly, we reiterate our guidance that full year 2019 O&M expenses will be approximately 2% lower than 2018's levels. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In May of 2019, PSCo filed an unopposed settlement agreement in its Colorado steam rate case. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $6.6 million, an equity ratio of 56%, an ROE of 9.67% for AFUDC purposes and utilization of TCJA benefits. New tax rates would occur in 2 steps: in 2019 and October of 2020. The administrative law judge has recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending at Colorado commission decision. In May of 2019, PSCo also filed an electric rate case in Colorado, seeking an increase of $158 million or 5.7% based on historic test year with a capital reach forward for 2019 capital expenditures, an equity ratio of 56.46% and an ROE of 10.35%. The request reflects capital investment for our advanced group initiative and changes in depreciation rates, both of which were previously approved by the commission. PSCo's requested rate is effective in January of 2020. We also reached a settlement in Wisconsin, which will maintain current electric rates through 2021 and result in a modest natural gas rate decrease. The settlement is pending a commission decision. In July 2019, SPS filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an increase of $51 million based on historic test year with a capital reach forward, an ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54.8%. The request largely reflects capital investment for the Hale Wind project as well as other capital invested to support strong growth in the region. We anticipate rates going into effect in the second half of 2020. In addition, we are planning to file an electric rate case in Texas in August to recover our investment in the Hale Wind project as well as other SPS capital projects. Both the Texas and New Mexico commissions previously granted a Certificate of Need and recovery mechanisms for the Hale Wind farm. Next, I want to give a quick update on our PPA buyout efforts. During the quarter, we reached a partial settlement with various environmental and labor groups that support the Mankato combined cycle acquisition. Last week, the Department of Commerce and the Office of the Attorney General filed comments recommending against the acquisition, however, their recommendations included alternate customer protection mechanisms if the commission approves the acquisition. We believe we've demonstrated the economics of ownership were still compelling despite the disagreements on modeling highlighted by the comments. We anticipate hearings and a commission decision in September. We are cautiously optimistic the commission will approve the acquisition based on the anticipated customer savings and the long-term value to the state that our ownership of the facility would create. Additionally, we are actively working across our 4 operating companies to identify other customer beneficial asset acquisition opportunities and will work proactively with our stakeholders to identify the cost, the environmental and the labor benefits of these transactions, and we will share these developments as they progress. With that, I'll wrap up. We had a solid second quarter and are right on our budget for first half earnings. Weather and O&M were slightly unfavorable to our budget, but sales and margin were slightly favorable to offset. In the second half of the year, we expect year-over-year favorability in O&M, margin and sales. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense will moderate due to the timing of lower levels of prepaid pension amortization in Colorado. As a result, we're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. In summary, we've filed our preferred plan in the Minnesota resource planning proceeding, which will continue our clean energy transition and if approved, will allow us to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2030. We completed the Hale Wind farm on time and under budget. We reached constructive rate settlements in Wisconsin and our steam case in Colorado. Constructive legislation was passed in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 earnings guidance and our long-term objectives of 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
Alex Morgan: This is Alex Morgan, calling in for Julien. And congratulations on the results and being able to maintain the year-end guidance and maybe on the upper end of the range. I had a few quick questions. And the first one, I was wondering if you could provide any more regulatory environment color specifically around New Mexico and Colorado. In New Mexico, I know that PNM, for example, is potentially struggling around whether securitization will apply to its future plans. I was wondering if we should interpret that as the commission looking at different rate cases with a fine-tooth comb. And then in Colorado as well, I was just hoping for a little more color over there.
Benjamin Fowke: Color in Colorado around securitization?
Alex Morgan: Just in terms of the regulatory environment and the pending rate cases in both.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, let's start with Colorado. I mean I think -- we continue to think we have a constructive environment. We're very much aligned with the policymakers in the state. If you look at what we're filing in that rate case, it's really capital oriented. And as Bob mentioned, most of the capital that we're talking about has already been approved. So I think it continues to be very constructive, and it helps when you're keeping your bills -- total bills very flat. In fact, in Colorado, they're less today than they were 4, 5 years ago. So I think we're in very good position in Colorado. Moving to New Mexico. First of all, SPS, with the overall growth in both Texas and New Mexico, is just really stunning, and it's creating a lot of opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, really pleased with some of the bills that were passed in Texas that support a better regulatory environment. We are aligned in New Mexico. Now securitization for us in New Mexico is not a very big deal. So I can't give you much more color on that. But I do like the -- I actually think the new administration and some of the changes in the commission are very positive for New Mexico and positive for SPS overall.
Robert Frenzel: One other thing to point out Alex, we did reach a very constructive settlement with the New Mexico commission, which allowed for an ROE of just over 9.5% and an equity ratio of 54% earlier in the first quarter. And that was, I think, a good set of data points for the commission.
Alex Morgan: That's very helpful. One quick question on the updates around PPAs rolling off. Is there a date by which these need to be announced to take advantage of tax benefits? Or is this something that we'll see just rolling into the 2020s, whether or not the PTC can be triggered? If there's any wind the PPAs rolling off that you might take in-house.
Robert Frenzel: Alex, I don't think there's any deadlines on any of the PPA buyout strategies that we've discussed. And while some of them may be triggered by repowering of various from wind farms, I would say that's the only trigger for an opportunity for us to potentially buy in one of these assets that we already contract for the benefit of our customers.
Alex Morgan: And last quick question. On Mankato, in terms of the time line of the commission decision, when are you thinking about that?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I think the commission is scheduled -- or will most likely take it up in September -- probably in the middle of September. And so we'll have our answer then.
Operator: And next, we will hear from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller: Texas, you made some comments there about the positive regulatory environment developments there, especially on the transmission side. Would you anticipate potentially putting more capital to work in that state now?
Benjamin Fowke: No. Well, I mean, it's growing pretty significantly, and there's a lot of capital that needs to be put into keep up with that growth. And there was wider mechanisms that we have both for the meter investment, the right of first refusal and of course, of the writer for new gen are very supportive of putting more capital to work at SPS.
Robert Frenzel: And Travis, this is Bob, we're working through our long-term financial planning process and capital planning process, and we expect to be back with guidance in the third quarter.
Travis Miller: Okay. So if I recall correctly, it rolls off pretty quickly in Texas, at least after the wind farms, right? So that could possibly come up in the 2021-type range?
Robert Frenzel: Yes. I would say that the wind farms are certainly a large and discrete investment, but our run rate capital in SPS is positive driven by increased load and increased customer growth there.
Travis Miller: Got it. Yes. And then very high level, if we look back over the last 10 years, you guys have been right at the forefront of smaller deals. Gas plus renewables offsetting coal, I think, in the coal retirements. As you look forward kind of in the next 10 years, once coal essentially comes out of texture for you, guys, are we in an environment where it's gas versus renewables, or the that solar or wind, but is that the offset? Is that the competition assuming very flat or little growth on the demand side?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I think -- thank you, Travis, for that. I mean first of all, let's get to that 80% milestone, which is a big milestone by 2030. I mentioned, we will be completely out of coal in the Midwest. Still have some coal after that on our system, so there'd be more transitioning. I think gas and renewables and the extension of niche will make all the sense on how we continue on that path to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. I don't think they really compete with each other. They're going to -- they'll support each other at that point. Of course, we'll also be looking at the role batteries can play on our grid, the role batteries can play with storage. I think it'll be even more important to have demand response-type programs. And of course, we're very excited about EVs and what that might mean to our system and the interactions -- new interactions that can create with our customers.
Travis Miller: Okay. And do you still see a role for gas in a 100%-type carbon-free environment? How would that -- how do you see that vision?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes. Very good question. I mean by 2050, unless those plants are burning renewable gas, which is certainly a possibility, you wouldn't want them on the grid. But that is a number of decades away. And I think it's incredibly important that you take early action. And so I think gas is how we move away from coal, how we maintain reliability, how we maintain affordability. We get to that 80% mark, and as I've said before, we're going to need to work on those technologies to get that last bit of carbon off of our system. There's a lot of different things it could be. But for now, we need to take early action, and gas is the avenue to get us there.
Operator: And our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: So in Colorado, there has been some discussion about some wind contractors who have been basically not signing on to the contracts, that have been basically backing out of their deal with you guys because the price has been too low. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that and what you're seeing in terms of having to recontract and sort of what we'll start seeing in the economics out there.
Benjamin Fowke: Paul, are you talking about wind? Or are you talking about solar?
Paul Patterson: I thought it was wind. I thought it was renewal contracts...
Benjamin Fowke: Well, we had -- well, what I'm familiar with, and I asked David Eves to help out if I'm missing something. But we have some solar contracts, one of which was going to support our deal with the EVRAZ steel mill. That particular vendor pulled out due to the economics and the change of ownership. The good news is we've gone out with bids and have received very attractive replacement bids. So I think things remain on track in Colorado, both for the CEP plan as well as our unique deal to keep EVRAZ right there on Colorado and expanding. David, did I miss anything? Okay.
Paul Patterson: Okay. So what I'm reading here about some wind contractors backing out that, that is the -- that, that article is inaccurate, I guess, is that correct? I can follow up with you guys afterwards. I just saw the -- okay, we can talk about it afterwards.
Benjamin Fowke: So let's follow up on it. If I'm missing something, we can look at it. But we've had, in the past, remember, we have stepped into some wind developer contracts that were -- they couldn't make it happen, and we came in and taken over the project and made it happen for the benefit of our customers. I think that probably points to a strong reason why you continue to want to have a mix of PPAs and utility ownership because we've demonstrated we can bring things to the table. But -- and when you do a big solicitation, you're going to have some bids that can't cut the mustard in the end, and you just keep moving to the next bit or you step in and take it over yourself. But I don't see this as anything but business as usual.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And you don't see any change, okay. So it sounds like because, yes, there might be some people dropping out, but for most part, you haven't seen any change in the economics or anything significant in terms of renewable development and the outlook for the CEP or anything. Is that a good way to summarize that?
Benjamin Fowke: That's absolutely right, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Great. And then also just picking up on the storage discussion that you mentioned, I know that you have 235 megawatts, I believe you do, under the CEP. And this is wondering in general, we're seeing a lot of discussion, different developers talking about combined renewables with a battery coming in quite cheap in different RFPs. I'm just wondering, since you guys are sort of big on this stuff, what you're seeing and how you see the economics of that developing sort of beat this -- or cheaper than a peaker, that kind of thing. What are you guys seeing practically on the ground? What was your outlook there?
Benjamin Fowke: So great question, and we are seeing some very attractive bids, and you mentioned the 275-megawatt battery project. That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very viable and you planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off of that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear.
Robert Frenzel: Paul, one thing I'd add on to Ben's comments is we did do a broad solicitation for the Colorado Energy Plan. We published the results of that solicitation with averages, and we published the solar-only and a solar-plus storage average. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips. But if you want more details on what we saw about 18 months ago on the solicitation, we can share that with you. Obviously, the markets move for both solar and for storage assets, and we continue to see price declines in both of those asset classes. But I think that those midpoints will highlight to you how competitive some of that stuff is becoming over time.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. We look forward to seeing people on the road in the third quarter. We have quite a queue for conferences and road shows that we highlight in our investor materials. Lastly, and before we depart, I'd like to introduce our new Director of Investor Relations, Emily Ahachich. She joins us from our internal corporate strategy group. She will be working with Paul and Darin going forward. So please feel free to reach out to anybody in the Investor Relations if you have any questions or calls. Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: And once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Paul Johnson : Good morning. And welcome to Xcel Energy's 2019 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we’ll review our first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. As you’re aware, there are slides that accompany today’s call available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain for looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. On today's call, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures, including ongoing earnings, and electric and natural gas margins. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. And I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $0.61 per share, compared to $0.57 per share last year. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. So, let me start with some quick highlights from the quarter. In February, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 per share, or 6.6%. This represents an annualized increase of $0.10 per share, which is a step-up over historic levels of $0.08 per share. We are growing the dividend at an increased rate due to our strong transparent earnings growth profile and the flexibility afforded by our low dividend payout ratio. We also continue to make strong progress on our Steel for Fuel strategy, with almost 3,000 megawatts of new wins that has received regulatory approval and is moving forward in the construction process. In Colorado, the Commission approved our Certificate of Need for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm based on constructive settlement which includes a construction cost cap and a customer protection mechanism. We will recover costs upon completion through riders until the next rate case, after the project goes into service. Our Hale project in Texas is on track with construction expected to be completed in June, on time and within budget. And we are waiting for final generation interconnect studies and agreements for our Sagamore project in New Mexico and our Crowned Ridge III project in Minnesota. We expect construction to begin later this year. All of our other wind projects are in various stages of permitting and construction and will be completed as expected between 2019 and 2021. These projects highlight the excellent planning, construction and project management skills of our employees. In December, we were the first utility in the United States to announce plans to achieve an  80% carbon reduction by 2030 and 100% carbon free electricity by 2050. We're excited to work with stakeholders as we continue to clean energy transition while providing reliable service and keeping the bills low. Legislative session is still ongoing in most of our states and we continue to work with stakeholders on various legislative initiatives that would impact the utility sector. In Texas, there are bills under consideration that would provide the right of first refusal on new transmission projects and rider recovery for new generation and AMI investment. The outlook for these proposals is positive and points to a more constructive regulatory environment in Texas. In New Mexico, the Energy Transition Act was signed into law by the Governor in March. This law targets a 50% renewable portfolio standard by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. We believe we're well-positioned to meet to the 2030 milestone. In Colorado, there's proposed legislation that quantified our plans to achieve a 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and 80% carbon reduction by 2030. In addition, the bill is expected to provide for voluntary securitization as an option, and it targets utility ownership of 50% of all generation and provides customer protections. We’re proud to be leading the clean energy transition and support these bills which are consistent with our carbon reduction objectives, and provide positive benefits for our customers and our shareholders. This is another example of our strong alignment with policymakers in our states. I also want to recognize the efforts of our employees as they work through the polar vortex and the bomb cyclone that hit our various states. They did a great job working in extreme conditions to restore service in record time. I’ll now turn the call over to Bob and he will provide more detail on the quarterly results and our regulatory plans.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $0.57 per share in 2018. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include high electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, including the impact of favorable weather and various regulatory outcomes, and riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind production tax credits that flow back to our customers. In addition, our lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 per share. However, the majority of the lower effective tax rate is due to an increase in production tax credits which flow back to our customers through electric margin and tax reform impacts, both of which are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation interest and other taxes, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.11 per share, and higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. Please note that we calculated the EPS deviations for both years presented, based on a blended statutory tax rate of 25%, following the implementation of tax reform. Turning to sales. Our weather-adjusted electric sales increased 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong customer growth, partially offset by lower use for customer. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.5% for the quarter, as a result of strong customer growth and higher use per customer. For 2019, we're still anticipating relative flat consolidated electric sales, which reflect some discrete known declines and large customer usage, and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019, reflecting continued growth in C&I and residential loads. Turning to expenses. Our O&M expenses increased by $40 million, reflecting costs from substantial winter storms, the in-servicing of the Rush Creek wind farm, higher business systems and benefit costs, and the timing of plant overhauls. Over the last five years, we've increased our rate base by approximately 7% annually, while keeping O&M expenses relatively flat. Over the same time period, customer expectations and risk aversion have increased. As a result, we're increasing our O&M standing in strategic areas to enhance the customer experience, increase cybersecurity and reduce systematic risk in our operations. And we remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking other costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. Therefore, we’ve raised our 2019 O&M guidance, which reflects a decline of approximately 2% from 2018 levels. We expect to offset the impact of the slightly higher O&M and are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range consistent with our plan. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, SPS reached a settlement with the New Mexico Commission, resulting in a revised rate order, which eliminated the retroactive TCJA refund, increase the equity ratio to 53.97% from the previously authorized 51%, and increased the ROE up to 9.56% from the previously authorized 9.1%. Revised orders expected to increase annual revenue by $4.5 million, effective in March of 2019. We believe this is a constructive settlement and a sign of progress in New Mexico. In addition, we're planning to file electric cases in Colorado later in the second quarter, Texas and New Mexico this summer to recover our investment in the Hale Wind Project as well as other SPS capital projects, and Minnesota in November. With that, I'll wrap up. In summer, we had a strong first quarter. We increased our dividend for the 16th straight year. We reached constructive settlements in our rate case in New Mexico and in the CPCN proceeding for our Cheyenne Ridge wind farm. There is constructive legislation that's being considered in our various states. And we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the update you gave on O&M, which obviously -- I think you've been saying you expected to go back to 2017 levels, now you're saying just down 2%. But, that would still put you at 2.3, roughly, in aggregate. So, which was the run rate you were talking about last quarter? So, just can clarify, are you talking about more of a structural uplift, some of these customer experience investments or are we really sort of increasing one area and saving elsewhere?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean, I think, it's -- first of all, I guess, I would say, Jonathan, we are ahead of plan, and that's a good thing, despite the additional O&M that Bob described. We continue to take out costs out of our business smartly. But, we're reinvesting some of those cost savings into things that I think are really important for our customers, and improving the customer experience as part of that, reducing systematic risk in areas of cybersecurity, gas safety, proactively implementing best practices for wildfire risk. I think, these are things that are important. And we're putting a little more money in that than we originally planned. When we look ahead to 2019 -- or rather 2020, I think, you can expect us to keep O&M relatively flat with where we end up in 2019.
Jonathan Arnold: And your comments on, despite the higher expense, still being in the guidance range, are you -- is embedded within that comment that you're skewing a little lower in the range than you might have otherwise been or am I reading too much into that?
Ben Fowke: No, absolutely not, Jonathan. We're ahead of our internal plans as of right now.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now take our second question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha: First question, there's been some opposition to the Mankato acquisition, as you filed for approval for that. Can you just give us an update and your current confidence level of getting that approved?
Ben Fowke: Yes. Ali, it's not really unusual in these sorts of situations for the department to have negative comments, not only with us but other utilities in the state. But, I think what you'll find and if history is any guide, is as we give the department more information, so they can better model the customer benefits, you start to see the comments be more supportive. We believe that this is of great economic benefit to our customers. I think, it's an important asset for us to own for the long-term and we ultimately think this gets approved.
Ali Agha: And the timing I believe is June or so, is that right?
Ben Fowke: Yes. I believe that's right.
Ali Agha: Okay. And then, also, can you remind us, currently, what's the regulatory lag in the system? And have you reached a point where the rest of it is just structural, or is there any further improvement potential...
Ben Fowke: We’ve achieved the 50 basis points objective, Ali. And, there's some opportunity for improvement. But to your comment, you’re starting to get to the point where we've got -- most of it is structural lag at this point.
Ali Agha: I see. And then, last question, apart from calling out O&M being maybe slightly higher for this year than budgeted, are there other movements in your basic assumptions for the year, either positive or negative to be aware of? And just specifically on O&M again, I don’t know if I picked it up, but what kind of incremental spending are we thinking about this year versus what you had previously assumed?
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Ali, it’s Bob. We've had favorable weather through the first quarter and favorable sales for the first quarter. So, we think there's some benefit there to offset some of the higher expenses that Ben mentioned. We also have an expectation for slightly lower interest expense through the that year than we’ve given original guidance for. And as he mentioned in the previous question that we are above our internal forecasts for the year. So, we feel confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our range.
Ali Agha: Okay. And Bob, just to clarify, you’re talking about O&M being down 2% versus ‘18 as your base assumption for the year? What was it before that, just to give a sense of how much it's changed?
Bob Frenzel: Yes. We've been guiding to flat to 2017. And so, the guidance -- we're probably 2% above ‘17 levels or 2% below ‘18 levels of guidance for ‘19.
Ali Agha: I got you. Thank you.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.
Bob Frenzel: It appears that there might be -- let's take one more call.
Operator: Yes. We do seem to have another question that just joined from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Julien, we could never not let you get a question in.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, sorry. This is actually Richie here on Julien.
Ben Fowke: We’ll see you later, Richie.
Unidentified Analyst: Just had a quick question on the Texas rider legislation. How meaningful is the improvement in regulatory lag there as that legislation passes, given the Sagamore plant is coming online in 2020?
Ben Fowke: Well, remember, we already have a settlement deal for our wind assets. But, I mean, look, it's helpful. I mean, it's helpful as that system continues to grow on with really good sales. I would expect that we're going to need more generation, potentially both fossil and renewable. And that's a great thing to have along with the rider for the investment and the smart meters that we're looking to do. So. It's going to help. And, again, I think the environment in SPS is getting better.
Bob Frenzel: Hey, Richie. It's Bob. Just to add on to what Ben said. We're expecting to file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico to support the investment. We expect our Hale wind farm to go in service next month -- or sorry, early June. And we'll put those into rates almost immediately, based on the settlement mechanisms that Ben mentioned. In addition to the wind, we’ll also get the rest of the capital in Texas in time -- in service in more real time. And that's all part of the wind settlement agreement. I think the AMI and the generation, potential riders that are working through legislation would further increase as we seek to do AMI and additional generation in the next decade.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frenzel, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks for participating in our call this morning. And please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy 2018 Year End Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 year end earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your question. This morning, we will review our 2018 results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. On today's call we will discuss certain ongoing earning metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Favorable GAAP measures and reconciliation are included in our earnings release. As a reminder some of the comments used during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Well, thank you Paul and good morning. And I say good morning, but as you all probably know it is brutally cold here in Minnesota and I would like to thank men and women of Xcel who worked so hard to keep the gas flowing and the electricity on over these last few days. I would say with just few exceptions our system had held up remarkably well and that’s due to their dedication and commitment, so thank you. So 2018 was an excellent year with a long and impressive list of accomplishments, let me share a few of them with you. We reported ongoing EPS of $2.47 in 2018 and this was our 14th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We increased our long-term EPS growth target rate to 5% to 7%. We raised our dividend by $0.08, which represents the 15th straight year we have increased our dividend. We completed our equity issuances for the five year forecast period and don’t plan any additional equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and benefit programs. Our stock hit an all time high closing price of $53.68 in December. We secured approval for over 1,000 megawatts of new wind in Texas and New Mexico, our Colorado Energy Plan and 300 megawatts of wind in South Dakota. We completed construction of our 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind farm on time and under budget. We reached agreements to purchase the 760 megawatts Mankato natural gas combined cycle plant for $650 million and to acquire 70 megawatts of repowered wind farms for $135 million. We expect both acquisitions to be approved later this year. Our nuclear plants combined to achieve a capacity factor of almost 96% while reducing O&M cost by almost 3%. We filed an electric vehicle pilot program in Minnesota. We resolved tax reform proceedings in most jurisdictions with a final resolution in North Dakota expected later this year. I am also very proud that our actions have been noticed by others resulting in numerous awards including being recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s most admired companies for the fifth consecutive year, being honored by the Military Times as Best for Vets employer for the fifth consecutive year and being named Utility of the Year by Utility Dive. So 2018 was a great year, but we’re now focused on 2019 and beyond. Leading the clean energy transition continues to be a strategic priority for us as we carryout Xcel Energy’s vision to be our customer’s preferred and trusted energy provider also helping us to achieve two other strategic priorities, keeping our customer bills low and enhancing the customer experience. We’re a national leader in wind energy through our steel for fuel strategy, which adds renewables while at the same time lowering bills. As a result, we made outstanding progress achieving a 39% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. But we want to do even more, which is why we set a vision to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. Longer term, we expect to deliver our customers 100% carbon free energy by 2050. These are the most ambitious carbon goals within the electric power industry and I am confident with supportive public policy, we can achieve the 80% interim goal while keeping our bills affordable and our product reliable. Technologies come a long way in the last ten years and it gives me confidence that our 100% carbon free bill can be met as well. We look forward to working with our regulators, legislators and stakeholders to implement our plans across the jurisdictions we serve. We're also very focused on our customers. Earlier this month, we entered into agreements to provide electric service to a proposed new Google data center located on property adjacent to our Sherco plant in Minnesota. As you may remember, back in 2015, we announced our attention to close two of the Sherco coal units. This particular location for the new data center will create jobs, bring investment to the state and benefit all of our customers. And consistent with our goal to lead the clean energy transition, we are planning to serve the data centers energy needs with 100% renewable energy, and I believe our environmental leadership will lead to even more economic development opportunities over time. We also recently filed to expand our pilot renewable connect program in Minnesota. Renewable Connect allows customers to choose how much of their energy comes from renewable sources, has been extremely popular and has commissioned approval in Minnesota, Colorado and Wisconsin. This is yet another way for us to add renewable energy and meet the needs of our customers. And importantly, Renewable Connect does not negatively impact the bills of non-participants. And we anticipate that future expansions at Google and in Renewable Connect program will create potential renewable ownership opportunities for Xcel. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone. My comments today will focus on full year 2018 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. As Ben discussed, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance. We recorded 2018 ongoing earnings of $2.47 per share compared with $2.30 per share in 2017, representing the top-end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Weather was certainly a positive factor contributing $0.07 per share compared to normal in our annual results. We also incurred additional O&M expense, which offsets the weather benefit. Looking at the income statement, the most significant drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.44 per share, largely due to favorable weather and strong electric and natural gas sales as well as rate increases and riders to recover our capital investments and higher AFUDC equity, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share, reflecting growth in capital investments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.10 per share, increased G&A expense as a result of our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items combined to reduce earnings per share by $0.14. Turning to sales, our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.3% in 2018, reflecting strong economies in the states we serve and favorable sale to commercial and industrial customers as well as solid residential sales growth. Our electric sales growth was strongest at our SPS business with 4.1% growth driven by the oil and natural gas sector in the Permian Basin. Weather adjusted natural gas sales increased 2.4% in 2018 as a result of continued customer growth and increasing customer use, largely in the commercial and industrial customer segment. For 2019, we are anticipating relatively flat electric sales, which reflect some specific declines in large customer usage, more modest oil and natural gas driven growth and expectations of lower use per customer in the residential sector. For natural gas, we expect slightly positive sales in 2019 reflecting continued growth and C&I and residential loads. Turning to expenses, O&M increased by $82 million, or 3.6%, reflecting additional spend for vegetation management and system maintenance due to the hot summer. Business systems cost investments to improve and enhance business processes and customer service as well as damage prevention and remediation costs. We remain committed to our long-term objective of improving operating efficiencies and taking costs out of the business for the benefit of our customers. While we continue to face rising costs in certain strategic areas, including the impacts of adding incremental renewable generation, improving cyber security and enhancing the customer experience, we are focused on delivering 2019 O&M expenses at levels that in aggregate are consistent with 2017. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. We had a very busy and productive year in which we filed and resolve multiple rate cases in addition to tax reform proceedings in all of our states. In 2019, we're planning to file a Colorado electric case in the spring, rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in the summer and a Minnesota rate case in November and a Minnesota resource plan in the summer. We anticipate that new rates from these cases will go into effect in 2020. With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2018 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 14th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 15th straight year. We completed our equity issuance for the five year time period. We continue to execute on our steel for fuel strategy, receiving regulatory approvals for new wind in Texas and New Mexico and South Dakota as well as the Colorado Energy Plan. We entered into agreement to acquire the 760 megawatt Mankato Natural Gas Plant and buyout 70 megawatts of wind PPAs in Minnesota. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we’ll now take some questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, you are a little faint, but good morning, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, well, I appreciate it. Good morning. Congratulations again on the results.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just to touch base a little bit, I know there's a litany of difference regulatory, more importantly legislative angles for this year. Can you touch base a little bit on them by state – specifically Texas, Colorado and the status in Minnesota? I know something just came up there as well since to go through across the three…
Ben Fowke: So there's a whole bunch of them. There is a lot of things. There's – it's pretty busy legislative agenda. So why don't I touch on a few that we're looking at it and if I miss one, please ask a follow-up question, Julien. Starting in Texas, of course we're interested in the AMI legislation that would basically allow non-ERCOT companies to get the same regulatory treatment that that ERCOT companies receive concurrent recovery that’s particularly important. It's important to note there that in our CapEx and the CapEx in the forecast period, we anticipate about $80 million spend of AMI. So wouldn’t increase the capital too much there, Julien, but the recovery would be great. And we're optimistic about that. Over in New Mexico, of course, we're following the RPS standard to see where that goes and watching the securitization bell as well. Moving up to Colorado, there is a number of different things proposed in Colorado. The securitization bill is one that we're following. Our thought there is it could be another tool in the toolbox if you will. That said, you know, some of the things that we've already accomplished leading the clean energy transition while keeping those flat taking care of our community something I'm particularly proud of, taking care of our employees. I think we've shown we can do and achieve pretty remarkable results. That was always in the details, but the securitization bills that it can become a valuable voluntary tool. Well, that will be great. Minnesota, there's just a number of things going around; some addresses the community solar gardens. Most of those are – most of the legislation I would say in Minnesota is in earlier stages. So if there's something specific that you're interested in, in Minnesota, just a follow up. Did I catch everything you're interested in? Or I missed anything, Julien?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No, I think you did. I mean, I'm more curious as you think about some of these playing out, are there any specific capital items that coming out of these that you would be focused on the Colorado or otherwise, but I know there's a lot, that's why I wanted to get the priorities from you if you will.
Ben Fowke: Well, no. If any of those bills will drive much incremental capital, I mean, I am – there’s the EV storage bill that could be helpful to us and would allow us to do more with basically seating what I think is going to be a very interesting development in the future and that's the electrification of transport. So that could drive some CapEx, but a little early to put anything hard dollars on the table, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. And just a quick clarification if I can. On the capital investment forecast that EEI you provided an incremental case in the billion dollars of additional capital. Obviously, you're changing around slides every update. Is there anything to read into that?
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean I think we shifted some things from 2019 and 2020, but we overall – and we put the Mankato and the wind farm into our base forecast now, but the overall spend is still roughly the same I believe in that timeframe. So in those out years, we are still looking to have achieved that incremental case, which would grow rate base by about 7%. And I think we can get there in a number of different ways. Of course, we continue to look for opportunities to buyout PPAs and other opportunistic things. So that and the fact that if you look at history, Julien, the out years tend to be more capital intensive as the out years become forward years.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thanks for clarifying that.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify. Ben, I think you have mentioned you're expecting both the Mankato and the 70 megawatt buyout approval to happen. Did you say by the third quarter? I just wanted to clarify when you are expecting that.
Ben Fowke: Yeah, I think that's a good timeline to think about, end of the second quarter or early third quarter.
Ali Agha: Okay. And with the $20.1 billion five year CapEx that does equate to 6.5% rate base CAGR as you had previously shown us. Is that correct?
Ben Fowke: Correct.
Ali Agha: Okay. And to - if I think about, the long-term earnings goal aspiration of 5% to 7% to hit the high end of that 7%, does that assume that you would get that incremental billion dollars, so that rate base could also be growing at 7% or do you think the high end growth rate can be achieved just based on the CapEx as you have laid out today?
Ben Fowke: I mean, I think the incremental CapEx would certainly be helpful, but there are other levers as well. Improvement in a regulatory outcomes, specifically higher ROEs, that would also be very helpful. Sales, we've got – we had a good year in 2018. We expect it to be a little bit flatter in 2019 and beyond, but if we got some pickup there that would be helpful. And of course we continue to look for cost efficiencies in the business. So there's multiple levers. The incremental CapEx just being one.
Ali Agha: Okay. But I guess looked another way, Ben, I mean assuming you do get that incremental CapEx. Should we – we should not expect the 5% to 7% growth rate to change as a result of that. That would just make it easier to perhaps hit the higher end. Is that the way to think about it?
Ben Fowke: I mean we – as you know, Ali, we always take a look at that, but I mean I think what you just said is a good assumption.
Ali Agha: Okay. And my last question, can you just, I guess, give a little more detail as you mentioned your electric load growth weather normalized with north of 1% this – in 2018, which you are assuming flat growth in 2019. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on why you're expecting that to slowdown in 2019 versus 2018?
Bob Frenzel: You know, Ali, we had good solid growth in 2018, a lot of it was driven by large C&I demand and some oil and gas growth in our SPS business. We think that year-over-year we have a couple of discrete instances where we know we have a lower demand from some of those C&I customers and we don't expect as aggressive growth in the oil and gas industries we saw in 2018. Obviously, if we had upside as Ben mentioned to the sales growth in some of our expectations, if we exceeded the flat forecast, it would obviously be upside for 2019 earnings.
Ali Agha: I see. And lastly the DRIP program, does that support about a $75 million sort of annual run rate for equity issuance? Is that good for modeling purposes?
Bob Frenzel: Yeah, that's $75 million to $85 million is a good number.
Ali Agha: Got you. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Ali.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Christopher Turnure: Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on the incremental capital plan. You mentioned PPA buyouts are one thing that you're looking at there. What's the next milestone that we might see in that process? And is there anything else that you're looking at there where we could see some kind of information near-term?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think, we've talked about the universe of opportunities and it's going to be obviously case by case. Our corporate development team’s hard at work looking for those opportunities and making sure that the there's a good deal for the buyer and seller and just as importantly our customers. So there aren't really timeframes on that, but we are optimistic that there will be transactions to talk about in the future.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And then on the PSCo CapEx shift to 2019 from 2020. What was behind that? And then when we think about modeling for 2020 and feeding in the 500 megawatts of wind from the Colorado Energy Plan, how should we model that CapEx and rate base, and potentially earnings growth within the 2019 year?
Bob Frenzel: Yeah, Chris, it’s Bob. On the shift, when we filed our CPCN for the Colorado Energy Plan and the wind farm there, we had originally contemplated that being a build-own-transfer where the developer would construct it and transfer it to us at COD. Through the process of the fourth quarter in negotiations with the developer, we opted to step in by the land and development rights and build the project ourselves. So the shift in capital is just a pull forward from that wind farm. So you see an incremental capital in 2019 in Colorado and then probably slightly less capital in 2020 for the same wind farm.
Christopher Turnure: Got you. So net, net between the two years really no total change, just a pull forward of the CapEx and potentially earnings power as well?
Bob Frenzel: That's right. We'd have CapEx pull forward, AFUDC pull forward and slight interest expense pull forward, but in total in aggregate across the two years the same amount.
Christopher Turnure: Okay, got you. And then, I guess, just kind of summarize that and the impact on 2019 that looks like a positive since you introduced guidance at third quarter earnings, you also have the Mankato project, you had wind repowering elsewhere, flat load growth assumption for the year and maybe a little bit of weather benefit at least to kickoff the year here in the first 30 days or so. Is that kind of the correct way to think about the puts and takes around guidance since you originally put it out there?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, you certainly talked about some of the upside levers actually across the entirety of the system for the month. We'll see how it comes in. The upper Midwest is certainly very cold, but the rest of our jurisdiction had been relatively benign in January.
Bob Frenzel: It’s going to be 40 degrees here on Sunday, so – and that’s above, not below.
Ben Fowke: But, yeah, I think you hit some of the positive sensitivities for the year.
Christopher Turnure: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hi, Travis.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning.
Travis Miller: Just a bit of a higher level strategy question, but I was wondering if you could give your take on the idea of the SPP transmission area westward expansion, your thoughts there.
Ben Fowke: I'm not quite sure what your question is. David, do you have? No.
Travis Miller: I guess the Mountain West Transmission Group, just discussions…
Ben Fowke: Oh, you're talking more about Colorado now, aren't you?
Travis Miller: Yeah, it'd be Colorado and I believe Texas, part of your western Texas would be involved.
Ben Fowke: So, you probably know, Travis, that we looked at joining Mountain West. And at the end of the day, the cost benefit analysis really didn't pencil out for the benefit of our customers the way we were hoping it would. It doesn't mean we're not open to looking at those things in the future, but the math didn't work for us at least in this round.
Travis Miller: Okay. Would renewables be involved in that? Is that a big part of that…
Ben Fowke: Well, it’s certainly something we were looking at – I'm sorry, Travis. You go ahead. I cut you off.
Travis Miller: No, just if – you’re saying that – you heard that correctly. The renewables for SPP in general, is that part of the idea there?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, I mean, the advantage of joining Mountain West would be potentially a larger footprint, which is good for renewable integration. Certainly, we’re seeing the benefits of that with MISO and other regions. But again, their cost and other trade offs, when we added up the pros and the cons, we thought it was not enough of a benefit for our customers to move forward with it. Again, these things need to be periodically revisited and that's what we'll do.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. And then there’s another higher level question. When you think about Minnesota and the programs you have there, you’ve talked about the Renewable Connect and EV pilot, and obviously the renewables on the system. What's your view in terms of how that state looks in your system in say three to five years as you get through the later part of your capital spending in and even operating spending potentially?
Ben Fowke: It's absolutely amazing how quickly renewables. I think it's by 2022, if not 2021, renewables will be the biggest source of energy across all of our eight states and that includes the upper Midwest and Minnesota. And I believe around the mid 20s, we crossed the line and renewables will be 50% of our energy mix. So it's absolutely phenomenal. And Travis, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is also affordable. It's creating a brand for the state, which I think is helping to attract economic development. We're really excited about Google. I don't think that will be the last data center that we’re able to obtain. And I do think what we're doing with leading the clean energy transition can become a strategic asset for the state and our other states as well.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. I appreciate it.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Travis.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon: Hey, guys. Actually, you guys answered all my questions from prior analyst, so I'll give you the time back. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now take our next question from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So I have a really big picture question. So, I'm looking at the slide from your EEI deck with the PPA roll off. And I heard you mentioned the potential early buyouts of some of the PPAs. And now given what we're witnessing in California now with this whole discussion about how expensive renewable power PPAs has inflated customer bills. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, for instance, if there is any kind of a rule of thumb, what kind of CapEx opportunity do you see as these PPAs roll off. And just before I let you answer it, I'm just wondering if – is it a same type of rule of thumb that we have for O&M savings that some of the utilities mentioned that for instance, $1 of O&M allow us to spend anywhere between $6 and $7 of CapEx. Is the same rule of thumb applicable to those expiring PPAs? Thanks.
Bob Frenzel: Well, I mean, the CapEx rule of thumb would hold true to that if you're buying out a PPA and putting in a rate base, that's a good rule of thumb. We've got a large universe of power purchase agreements. There is a slide that you’re probably looking at from the EEI deck. I don't have it in front of me now. But we anticipate about 4,000 megawatts of those PPAs would – half of it in renewables and wind, I believe, and the other half in fossil fuels. It might be something that we could look at. Now whether or not we can pull the transaction again that – you got to – it has to work for us, it has to work for the seller and it has to work for customers. And we've had some success with that and we anticipate future success. But either way, Angie, when these PPAs roll off, most of them are at higher dollars than what the market prices would be now. And so that at the very least is going to help us with our very important objective of keeping bills low and create headroom for investment at that leverage point that you're talking about. So, it's really kind of a version of steel for fuel, if you will. So, we don't have quite the same high price type PPAs that I think PGE might have. But the reality is energy prices have fallen over the last 10 years. So as things we did 10 years ago roll off, it's going to create opportunities either for buying or at the very least keeping bills low for customers, all of which is good.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. But I'm just going back to that slide, and again, I know you're not seeing it right now hence I'm looking at it. So is it as simple as, I'm just basically looking at the expiration of those PPAs and I see that you guys are showing us rough pricing of those PPAs. And so basically in the absence of that expense, I'm multiplying that benefit by say six and seven times and that's the incremental CapEx I can spend.
Ben Fowke: Bob, I don't think we quite will look at it that way.
Bob Frenzel: When we think about the impact on customer bills and the headroom of that higher-priced PPAs rolling off create its factors into how we think about our capital investment program. As Ben says, we could invest in grid like infrastructure to a significant degree and we talk about what replacement costs in the same deck. We talk a little bit about what replacement costs for the grid would look like. We're throttled by that usually at the pace of what we think that our customers would or should afford as we increase the capital plan. So, fuel and purchase power reductions enable the company to invest in capital to the benefit of our customers while keeping bills low. So I don't know if we're using a specific multiplier there, Angie, but your thesis is correct.
Ben Fowke: Angie, I think the way you have to look – I think – and maybe we could take some of this offline, but I think the way you have to look at it is if it has a positive NPV for the customer, we would – and we can negotiate the transaction with that in mind. Then the opportunity is to put that CapEx. And you can probably do the math on 2000 megs of wind and 2000 megs of fossil, where that would roughly be. Then you'd be putting that in rate base and you'd get the earnings power off of it. That's the universe I think is of how we would look at it.
Angie Storozynski: Okay, I understand. Just one up. So can you give us a sense of you're running into any issues with finding good sites for future wind farms and if you're close to reaching a point where solar is becoming a cost competitive or attractive versus incremental winds?
Ben Fowke: I mean we – there are sites out there and we've had I think pretty good success in finding sites and I think the results speak for themselves there and those sites will continue to be available. As far as solar becoming more competitive, you're absolutely right. And I think the – my thought Angie is solar is going to continue to see significant cost reductions more than offsetting, in my opinion, the fall off of the ITC. And I think that marries up really nicely with the actual coal plant retirements that we're looking at because as you know solar has far higher planning capacity than wind does. Wind is more like fuel. Solar is kind of a mixture of the two. So I think the stars are aligning very well for us in that regard.
Angie Storozynski: Great, thank you.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Angie.
Operator: And we’ll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Jon.
Jonathan Arnold: Well, good morning guys.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: Hello.
Ben Fowke: Can you hear us?
Jonathan Arnold: I can. I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, we can hear you loud and clear.
Jonathan Arnold: Hello. Can you hear me now?
Ben Fowke: We can hear you.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. All right, I was – we got kicked off the call for a little bit and then came back. So I'm going to apologize if you already answered this one.
Ben Fowke: Must have been bad behavior, Jonathan.
Jonathan Arnold: It's – something was sensed. So O&M, you're targeting flat to 2017 levels, which means getting sort of back down to just under $2.3 billion as I read the face of the numbers. So – and you've been saying for awhile that you want to be flat through – out though 2022 at that kind of 2, 3 level. So you – is the kind of reduction in 2019 just kind of getting back down to plan, having been a little over in 2018? Or are you – is it a precursor to may be starting to push for something that's a bit better than flat? Just curious if you can maybe speak to the 2018 number and then that guidance.
Ben Fowke: Jonathan, one of the things to think about is we are adding a significant amount of new wind onto our system in advance of retiring any legacy generation and that new wind causes O&M upward pressures. So I would say that the balance of the base business is we continue to bend the cost curve on the base business while we absorb the incremental O&M from the wind. So as we absorb lots of new generation, we've had some cost pressures in O&M. I think generally keeping it flat is us bending the cost curve except for the new wind adds.
Jonathan Arnold: So is the forecast still like that $2.3 billion numbers out through the program or has that changed a little bit?
Ben Fowke: Yeah, I think that's a good – that's still a good assumption. That's still our guidance.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay, great. That was it. Thank you.
Ben Fowke: You’re welcome, Jonathan.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Paul, how are you?
Paul Patterson: Nice.
Bob Frenzel: Good morning.
Paul Patterson: So just one sort of quick question here. The – could you follow-up a little bit on the use of securitization as being one of the tools in the toolbox as you guys were indicating? What do you mean by that in terms of just how should we think about if the legislation were to pass, what might happen with that or how you guys might use that? 
Ben Fowke: Well in Colorado and in securitization in general, one there is two things it has to has. It has to be written in a way that technically you can actually do the bond programs off of it. And then, two, one of the things we'd be looking at is things like utility ownership of the generation that's been securitized. If those things come together and remember in Colorado at least it's a voluntary tool than it might be something we look at. But I think the important thing, as I mentioned Paul earlier, is that we've achieved the goals of securitization through our own efforts. And that includes community and employee taking care of both the communities and the employees and keeping our bills flat and that's what we've achieved. So we don't need securitization to keep doing that, but it – if it's something that makes it even more attainable then we're all for it.
Paul Patterson: Okay. I guess, I'm sort of wondering, I mean, in the case of, like, New Mexico, I can see with PNM what people are sort of thinking about. I'm just sort of, like, is there any particular project or issue that securitization would address that I'm just missing? I apologize for just being dense on this.
Ben Fowke: No, no, no. Again that's why I think it's just that tool in the toolbox. I mean, it's down the road it might be something we would want to look at, but there isn't anything we’re specifically thinking about today.
Paul Patterson: Okay, great. That’s it for me. Keep warm.
Ben Fowke: We will. Thank you.
Bob Frenzel: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. So, Mr. Frenzel, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Bob Frenzel: Well as always thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Questions will only be taken from institutional investors. Reporters can contact media relations with inquiries, and individual investors and others can reach out to the Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss earning guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and update you on recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments made during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Paul and good morning. We're having a great year and I am excited to discuss some of our accomplishments and an improved outlook. So let's start with earnings. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.96 per share, that's compared to $0.97 per share last year. Our earnings for the third quarter were consistent with our plans. And with the first three quarters of the year behind us, we're on track to deliver earnings at the high-end of our original earnings guidance range. We have also updated our base capital forecast, which reflects rate base growth of 6.2% rolling forward and using 2018 as a base. We're also confident there are incremental investment opportunities beyond our base capital plan, as we continue our steel for fuel and customer focus strategies. As a result, we are increasing our long-term EPS growth objectives to 5% to 7%. We're very confident in our ability to deliver earnings at or above the midpoint of the EPS growth range over the forecasted time period. Next, let me provide you with an update on some of our accomplishments, with a focus on our leading the clean energy transition and steel for fuel investment strategies. In August, the Colorado Commission approved our Colorado Energy Plan, which will result in the addition of 1,100 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar, and 275 megawatts of battery storage, along with the retirement of 660 megawatts of coal generation. PSCo will own 500 megawatts of new wind generation, acquire 380 megawatts of existing natural gas generation, and invest in new transmission for a total investment of about $1 billion, which is reflected in our updated capital budget. Colorado Energy Plan is projected to provide over $200 million worth of savings for our customers, while reducing emissions by 60% from 2005 levels. Renewables at PSCo will represent 55% of our fuel mix by 2026. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering this remarkable plan to our customers, the State of Colorado, and our investors. I really think it's a model for how the clean energy transition can pragmatically occur in the United States. As part of the Colorado Energy Plan, we also received Commission approval for our EVRAZ contract proposal. This represents a creative economic development effort and allows us to retain our largest customer in Colorado through a unique contract underpinned by the addition of 240 megawatts of third-party solar behind the meter for this customer. EVRAZ was considering moving out of the state, but instead plans to stay in Pueblo and expand its operation. This is great news for all of our customers and the company, but especially Southern Colorado. This is yet another example of how we have worked to have a positive impact on our local communities. We're seeing good progress as we move from the approval to execution stage with our steel for fuel program. We recently completed on time and under budget the construction of our Rush Creek 600 megawatt wind farm in Colorado. So we're well on our way to having approximately 11,500 megawatts of wind on our system by 2021, solidifying our position as the leading renewable generation utility in the United States, while providing significant customer benefit. By 2022, we expect to have 48% of our energy coming from renewables and we'll have reduced carbon emissions by 50% across all of our systems. Steel for fuel helps drive a very robust capital investment plan of $19.3 billion, and I'm confident we have upside potential to that capital forecast. We have a track record of consistently delivering more investment opportunities in the outer years of our forecast period and I believe this forecast will be no different. I also believe we have plenty of attractive capital investment opportunities beyond the forecasted timeframe. There will be multiple phases of steel for fuel and increased opportunities to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure. I'm also excited about the opportunities we have to deliver customized products to our customers and to partner with them to achieve their energy goals. Great example of that is our Renewable Connect programs, which have been a very big success in Colorado and Minnesota. Renewable Connect offers our customers a flexible and affordable way to receive up to 100% of their electricity from renewable energy, and also without the cost being subsidized by other customers. We filed for Commission approval of Renewable Connect in Wisconsin, and we plan to continue to expand the program in Minnesota and Colorado, which is another customer-driven way for us to add cost-effective renewables to our system. Xcel Energy is also leading the way towards an electric vehicle future that is cleaner, more affordable and more convenient for our customers. Our nation-leading clean energy initiatives, paired with the advances in automotive and battery technology, have created a pathway to reduce carbon in significant and exciting ways. We recently filed a plan in Minnesota that proposes initiatives and pilot programs focusing on three main areas; home charging, public charging, and fleet operations. Our goal was to test innovative EV services that can be expanded to our customers over time. This truly is an exciting time for Xcel Energy. We are leading the clean energy transition and providing our customers with new innovative products that will ensure we remain their trusted energy provider in the future and provide future investment opportunities for our shareholders. And wrapping up, I'd like to highlight a couple of awards we've received. Xcel Energy was recently recognized as the gold leader under the State of Colorado's Environmental Leadership Program for the company's environmental programs, emission reductions and stewardship initiatives. Xcel Energy was also recently named to the Forbes' best employer listing. We're ranked number 74 globally, which I think is a pretty significant accomplishment. And I think it's always nice to be recognized for our environmental leadership and our workforce culture. So with that, let me turn it over to Bob, who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben and good morning everyone. We had a solid third quarter with earnings of $0.96 per share compared with $0.97 per share last year. And on a year-to-date basis, we're now $0.17 ahead of last year. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter, after netting the impact of tax reform, include higher electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to favorable weather and sales growth, as well as rate increases in riders to recover our capital investment. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share; increased depreciation expense reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share; and higher interest expense to fund our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Turning to sales, on a weather-adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.3%, reflecting strong sales growth to our commercial and industrial classes and modest residential sales growth. Year-to-date, natural gas sales increased 1.9% on a weather-adjusted basis, reflecting continued customer growth and increasing use per customer. Weather's contributed approximately $0.06 per share this year as compared to normal, and as we indicated in the second quarter call, we've been investing in O&M to improve and enhance customer service. Accordingly, our third quarter O&M expenses increased by $57 million, which reflects increased vegetation management and maintenance due to the hot summer, initiatives to improve business processes, business systems costs and remediation costs for a former manufactured gas plant site. Next, let me provide a regulatory update. We've had a busy regulatory schedule between rate cases and tax reform this year. I'm pleased to point out that most of the regulatory proceedings have either been settled or finalized and we will enter 2019 with relative certainty around our rate revenue. In Texas, we have a rate case settlement with various interveners, in which there'll be no change in rates, as we will use the benefits of tax reform to offset our projected revenue deficiency. The settlement is pending a commission decision, which we expect during the fourth quarter. In October, we reached a settlement agreement with the Staff and the OCC to extend our pipeline integrity rider through 2021 in Colorado. This will provide timely recovery of about half of our capital investment in the natural gas business. The settlement is pending commission approval. And looking forward, next year we anticipate filing rate cases in Colorado in the second quarter and Minnesota in the fourth quarter, with new rates going into effect primarily in 2020. As we've discussed, we plan to file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico next year to incorporate the Hale Wind Farm and other infrastructure investment for which we expect real-time recovery. Next, I want to update you on the regulatory proceedings related to tax reform treatment. We've made significant progress on tax reform in all of our states. You can find additional discussion of each jurisdiction in the earnings release, so I'll just focus on a few recent developments. In Colorado, our tax settlement for electric operations was approved and will result in a $42 million customer refund and a $59 million accelerated amortization of prepaid pension assets for 2018. In 2019, the customer refund will increase to $67 million, and the amortization of the prepaid pension asset will be $34 million. Tax reform for 2020 and beyond will be addressed in our next electric case. For our natural gas operations in Colorado, we've agreed to refund the benefits of tax reform to our customers. As expected our tax reform true-up filing, we requested to increase the authorized equity ratio to at least 56% to offset the impact of tax reform on our credit metrics. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. In Minnesota, the Commission approved a customer refund of approximately $136 million and low income funding of $2 million. And finally, in North Dakota, we reached an electric settlement with the Staff, which includes a one-time customer refund of approximately $10 million, while NSP-Minnesota will retain the benefits of tax reform in 2019 and 2020 to offset revenue deficiencies that would have resulted in rate cases. Settlement is pending commission approval. Turning to earnings guidance, based on our year-to-date results and full-year expectations, we are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to $2.45 to $2.49 per share, which represents the high-end of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. We're also initiating our 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is consistent with our revised long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7% annually. Please note that our 2019 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are listed in the earnings release. I wanted to highlight a couple of them here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect flat electric sales and modest natural gas sales growth of 0% to 1%, and we expect O&M expenses to be flat with 2017 levels. In our earnings release, you'll find our updated five-year capital forecast, which reflects investment of $19.3 billion in our base capital plan and drives compound annual rate base growth of approximately 6.2% over the period. As Ben mentioned, we are confident that there are incremental investment opportunities beyond our base capital plan, as we continue our steel for fuel and customer focus strategies. We've updated our financing plan. In addition to reinvesting our cash flow back into infrastructure and our operating companies, we expect to issue operating company and holding company debt in approximately $690 million of DRIP and common equity to fund our capital plan. This will allow us to maintain our solid credit metrics with an expanded capital investment program. Let me wrap up by highlighting a few of our key accomplishments. We received approval of our Colorado Energy Plan. We received approval of the EVRAZ contract. We reached a settlement to extend our PSIA rider and we made significant progress on tax reform in all of our jurisdictions. We're on track to deliver 2018 earnings within a narrowed guidance range of $2.45 to $2.49 per share, and we've increased our long-term EPS growth rate to 5% to 7%. Finally, we've initiated 2019 EPS guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, which is consistent with our long-term objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we are prepared to take a few questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. We'll now take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, congratulations.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Absolutely. So, just a couple of things real quickly. First, just high level, what's [Technical Difficulty] (16:00) on the 5% to 7%. And what I'm getting at more is, is your commentary in the prepared remarks around the future investments and being able to roll forward, because obviously you provided 2022 and now 2023, but how do you think about the investments as the wind – and wind PTC scales down, whether it's solar or distribution or what have you, how do you think about the future sources to keeping this higher sustained level of growth going? And then separately, if I can come back just a little bit nitty-gritty here, just there's been a slight reduction, a nominal level of rate base on 2022 since your last update. Can you give us a little bit of a flavor of exactly what transpired there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. Well, I mean, obviously, we updated our capital forecast which is what we did rolling forward one year. And I think, Julien, when you look at it, I mean it's strong in its own merits, and reflects significant rate base growth of 6.2%. We also have clarity with our steel for fuel programs now. They're behind us and approved. And as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at our history, Julien, those outer years always get filled in. And I think if you go back, for example like to 2014 and look what we were forecasting in that 2017 to 2019 period of time, we were looking to about $2.8 billion average annual on those three years periods. And in fact, we are spending more like $4 billion. So, I'm quite confident we're going to find incremental opportunities in the forecast period. And then when you look beyond that, just as importantly, we're not done with the clean energy transition. We still have 4.4 gigawatts of coal on our system. I'm really excited, Julien, about customer-driven programs, like I mentioned, Renewable Connect. We're just now starting to develop more customized programs to allow customers to have EVs and other customized products. I think it's going to open up a whole new world for us. And of course, we are behind probably some of our peers in some of our grid monetization efforts. And so, I think we've got a great transparent opportunity to have investments going forward.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien, it's Bob. Just one more add there. On our base capital plan, we expect – as Ben indicated in his comments, that we expect that to drive earnings growth at or above the midpoint. And the incremental opportunities that Ben mentions would lead you to further growth rate in the range.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Can you come back just on the 2022 rate base, it's down about $300 million versus the last slide deck you provided, you gave about 35 CEP approval. So wanted to know what – is that a CEP change in terms of the final approval or is that something else just moving in and around in the forecast?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Julien, it's really just the nuances of developing the capital forecast. It's nothing, no one project or one decision point, it's just really the fact that as we update the timing of when CapEx goes into service, deferred tax assets, things like that, there is just going to be some natural movement in timing, Julien, basically, there isn't a project dropping out.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. All right. Great confirmation there. And then one further follow-up there. With respect to further grid mod, can you elaborate just a little bit further on opportunities maybe in Texas, I know there's some talk of legislation in the 2019 calendar year potentially around this?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, Texas is not one of our biggest jurisdictions, but we don't – it's one of the few places where I understand we still have manual meter reading. So I think there's tremendous opportunities to update the grid there. As you know, Julien, the bigger opportunities in SPS are keeping up with the incredible expansion of infrastructure required to drive oil and gas opportunities in the Permian Basin. And as you can see in the sales and some other commentaries we've made, that part of the country is really growing quickly.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you all very much. Congrats again.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Julien.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: On the equity, so, now, you're saying you've done $200 million of the $300 million via ATM in 2018 and you had $300 million in the plan – the prior five-year plan and now you've got $300 million in the new five-year plan, but nothing in 2019. Is that sort of an incremental $300 million sort of in the back-end of the new plan? Am I thinking about that right?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Jonathan, I think that what we said was, when we got the Colorado Energy Plan approved, we would likely need approximately $300 million of equity associated with that. So as we've rolled the Colorado Energy Plan into the capital forecast, we've also rolled that $300 million into the equity forecast. That equity is going to be timed more commensurate with the spend on the CEP, which is sort of 2021 timeframe.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just if I could – just revisiting the last question, you also had a change in the 2018 rate base, went down by $400 million. And if that hadn't happened, you'd have been showing a sub-6% CAGR. So I'm just curious what drove that shift. It's like a shift from 2018 to 2019. Can you shed some light on that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think as we think about $4 billion worth of capital spend that was planned in 2018, some of that capital might just get shifted into 2019, particularly as we do developments on our larger wind farm projects, some of that stuff is shifting across year end.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Some of it's timing of payments, the big turbine payments et cetera, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But the general message is the back end, there's more to come there basically.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think if you look at our historic track record, we always – I think first of all, we put out a very conservative transparent forecast. So there's not a lot of, well, we're going to find something, so let's put it in the forecast. And if you look at our historic track record, the outer years always turn out to have a heavier capital spend than what we originally forecasted going into those years.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha from SunTrust Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Ben, I wanted to clarify one point, if I heard that correctly, with regards to looking at the EPS CAGR and then looking at the rate base CAGR, so rate base CAGR of the 2018 is just over 6%, EPS now 5% to 7%. Was I hearing it right that to get to the 7%, high-end of that EPS CAGR, would imply some additional CapEx spend that you're confident you'll spend beyond what you've laid out for us or does that imply some improvement in earned ROE from where we are currently, so that EPS CAGR could actually be greater than rate base CAGR? Just wanted to clarify your message on how we get to a 7% EPS CAGR from here.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You want to take it?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Ali. It's Bob. Look, I think that to achieve the high-end of the earnings guidance range, you could see either driving the midpoint to a higher end would either be higher earned ROEs or incremental investment opportunities in our operating companies, and I think either are possible.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But if I stuck to the base plan, as you've laid out today, there is room for ROEs to go up, because in the past as we've talked, it seem to me that, in terms of finishing off any theoretical lag that wasn't much left, but are you indicating that there's still room to increase the earned ROEs from here?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's probably true. When we initiated or closed the ROE GAAP, we had about 90 basis points of lag. We've narrowed that to closer to 50 basis points of lag. And we think there's still upside opportunity to close that further.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And then with regards to...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And Ali, I think it's – okay, go ahead. Never mind. Go ahead, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: No. No. Please. No, no, go ahead, Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I mean, I think, if you look at a rising interest rate as we file rate cases, I am the first one to tell you that ROEs were sticky going down as interest rates fell, and I think they'll be sticky going up. But the fact of the matter is, and this is an issue we use every opportunity we can to talk to our commissions, we have below national average ROEs. So, I think we're going to be a little less sticky going up than perhaps others that have enjoyed better ROEs today. So, I think ROEs will improve. I think our base capital expenditures give us -solidly put us, as I said in my remarks, at the middle of that range, a little improvement in ROE of any additional CapEx and we're going to be even better than that, so we're really excited about this plan.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I got you. My other question was, when I look at the $19.3 billion plan, are there any constraints you think about, whether customer rate impact, how much equity you want to put in the system? When you factor all of those issues in, how much, I guess, capacity do you have to increase that plan and stay within whatever parameters that you like to track?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, I think that's a great question. It's something that we're always looking at and what I'm pleased to tell you is that while rate base is growing at 6-plus-percent in this timeframe and I think it will continue to grow at those kinds of rates going forward, the key is not to have that translate for the need for a corresponding rate increases to our customers. So if you look at our cost where we've been since 2013 on a total bill basis, our bills have actually fallen, that's lower commodity prices, that's the beginning days of steel for fuel, that's energy efficiency, and our own cost initiatives to keep rates low. If we look at the forecast time period, we don't think rates will go up any more than 1% to 2% on that timeframe. So that creates that headroom potentially for additional investments that I think are closely aligned with customer wants and expectation. So it's a really important thing, you've got to keep your eye on the ball. I don't think you can ask for more than CPI-type rate increases with and have success. And that's the beauty of steel for fuel and turning fuel into investment opportunities and et cetera. I mean, it allows us to grow, give you something to get excited about and give our customers what they want without a price increase.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And would you, I mean, just from a rough perspective, give us some quantification of how much headroom you think there is?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I really think it depends on what you're investing in. I mean, I think we have tremendous opportunities to continue to invest in our distribution grid, our gas infrastructure. And those are just conversations we're going to have with regulators, because there is as many opportunities as they want us to do.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So I can't really quantify it for you, Ali, but I mean, to the extent you can hold O&M flat, to the extent you can help customers be more energy efficient, to the extent you can do things like steel for fuel that save customers money, I think that creates the headroom to give us more runway than I would venture to say most of my peer companies have.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, we'll now take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is open.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks, hey, good morning, guys. I think you guys have really answered most of my questions, the only one I have and maybe...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Could we talk about the Jets then.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: ...Yeah, well, that's a short conversation, and not a great one, given the way you guys handled us on Sunday. But when we get out, I just don't recall these numbers, but when we get out to the end of your current capital plan, what percentage of your generation fleet remains coal, if any?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Its 4.4 gigs. So what's the – does anybody have the energy mix what that would be in coal?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It'd be less than 30%.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Less than 30%, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. So somewhere in the...
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: If we think about the forecast period being 2023, we really haven't gotten into the meat of the shutdown of the Sherco units 1 and 2 and Comanche units 1 and 2. By the time we shut those units down by the mid-2020s, we'll have about 4,400 megawatts of coal left on our system. And yeah, so I think that our declining coal percentage will continue both in terms of generation as well as capacity. And as we think about it as a percentage of rate base, our coal investment will be less than 5% of our rate base by that point too.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I can clarify.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Right. So less than 5% of rate base, and in terms of capacity and/or energy and I'm not looking for a precise number, it'll be substantially lower than 30%, substantially lower than 20%, just – but what's your guess?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It'll be lower than 30%, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Perfect. Yeah, we can have the conversation offline. I was just trying to get a sense of it, because I mean you guys have come up an incredibly long way with the steel for fuel plan. I mean, where were you five years ago to six years ago, was significantly...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, when we look back where we started this journey, I mean, we were dominated by coal, as you know. And again, we'll get there -we should have the energy mix, Greg, but when we get all the steel for fuel and win that we're talking about here by 2022, renewables is 50% of our energy mix, so coal has got to be – and gas, I think, somewhere around in the mid-20s. So it's falling. Then you look out to 2030, that's when we have still 4.4 gigs left after the coal retirements Bob mentioned, and I think the percentage then is somewhere in the 20%, isn't it? And more to come after that.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. Congratulations on that, guys. Thank you
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, the key is to do it in a way that doesn't sacrifice your reliability and affordability and that's what I'm very proud of.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Agreed. See you at EI. Thank you
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Right. Thanks, Greg.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: How are you?
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask one of the prior questions in a little bit of a different way, just on constraints if any to your rate base growth plan, it sounds to me like there's a lot of opportunity to invest. It sounds like the customer bill is something that you're clearly focused on and thinking about. But the inflation rate there does not sound particularly higher under your base plan, and today you introduced a bit of incremental equity through the five-year plan. Do you view the balance sheet as a constraint on that growth, given I guess the current capital market conditions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Take that.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, hey, Chris, it's Bob. We find that the capital markets have been very receptive to our offerings and our larger strategic story. And to the extent that they remain open, we certainly think we can access the markets, both the fixed income and the equity markets at rates that are appropriate to finance this plan. And if this plan were, as Ben indicated to, have additional investment opportunities, my belief is that capital finds good project and if we've got good projects, we will be able to raise the money.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great, good to hear. And then, given the unfortunately low ROE and kind of unfavorable rate case outcome in Mexico, can you give us your latest thoughts on that jurisdiction and strategy near term at least.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I mean it was a disappointment, there is no doubt about it. We did petition in the Mexico Supreme Court to stay that decision and that petition was successful. So we'll have a shot at getting it appealed and particularly as it relates to the refunding of the amounts under the tax reform. I've got David Eves sitting across from me, and he has worked with David Hudson who runs SPS, getting out there and out-reaching to our customers and our regulators. It's important, ROE matters, credit quality matters, or rather Moody's downgraded SPS, I think as a result of some of the New Mexico actions. We also recognize that we got to get out there and talk to our constituents more and this is a growing area, rate base is going to grow significantly I think by almost 50% with the win we're adding. We've got to get the right regulatory construct now. I think you also probably know that there's an election that's going to take place and there's five commissioners in Mexico, they're all elected, and we'll have three new commissioners as of January 1. So perhaps there's a chance to kind of restart the dialogue, if you will. David, do you have anything to add to that?
David L. Eves - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I think you covered it. An increased presence in New Mexico. We've already started working with our customers, the intervenor involved in the regulatory process, and we'll embrace, means, work with those new commissioners. And they had two important cases coming up with Hale and Sagamore in the middle of 2019 and then in 2020. So we'll position to get a very different outcome then.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hi, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning. Thank you. Hi.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Question again about that 5% to 7% range, interested in the opposite side of it, that 5%. What takes you down to that, would it be more unexpected operating cost are higher or is it more the projects and the CapEx toward the outer years don't come through...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I mean, I think...
Travis Miller - Morningstar: ...or something else.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think what takes you down is probably poor regulatory outcomes and declining sales and things like that that would create essentially more regulatory lag as you would have to file rate cases sooner. We don't anticipate that. In fact, I mean, I think we have pretty conservative sales assumptions for 2019. But you asked, so those are the things that we'd have to look at.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Good. And then second question. On some of these customer plans that you've talked about in closer touch with the customer, are there earnings opportunities there or is there just more of a reputation building and perhaps even down to the regulatory relations improvement, stuff like that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think there's earnings opportunities, and obviously, I think it enhances our reputation with our customers, which is always important. But yeah, no I think there's, I think there are definitively and definitely earning opportunities in the things we're talking about.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Their capital investments?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Making investments that help our customers be successful.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Great. Appreciate it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Travis.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Good morning. How are you doing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: So just one sort of quick follow-up. Moody's took rating action on you guys with a variety of your subsidiaries. And it seems that they're basically predicating the affirmation that in Colorado on you guys getting the regulatory treatment, the equity ratio bump that you're asking for, so just to sort of clarify here. If you don't get the regulatory treatment that you expect, would there be any change in the plan in and of itself, I mean, or would you just let the credit rating do what it does if you know what I am saying?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Paul, it's a – I mean, it's a great question, but I think you're talking about the Moody's recent credit action.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Yes. That's right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Right. My understanding – I'll turn this call or question over to Bob pretty quickly is that, the action there was the downgrade SPS. And I think that's the result of some of the regulatory actions that they took, and then the other one was to put the holding company on negative watch. I don't think they made any action in Colorado.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: No, let me clarify. I didn't mean that they took action. What they said, I guess, in their affirmation of the rating in Colorado was that it was – I mean, they seem to spell out very specifically that they were predicating it, you getting the regulatory treatment that you were seeking with the bump in the equity ratio. And I guess, what my question is, and I apologize if it wasn't clear, is what would happen if you don't get the regulatory treatment? Do you guys have some rating objective or would you just simply let the rating do whatever Moody's – let the rating agencies do whatever they're going to do, do you follow what I'm saying? Or would you guys – which is also discussed by Moody's, potentially change your CapEx or something else? Do you follow me?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Paul. This is Bob. In all of our jurisdictions, we interacted with the Staff and the Commissions around the importance of their decisions in preserving the credit ratings in our operating companies, in Colorado, in particular, we filed for what we thought was the appropriate capital structure for public service at Colorado, which was the 56% equity ratio in both the gas and the electric companies. And we stand by that recommendation as appropriate for preserving the credit quality in those companies. We've had a lot of conversations across the year about the importance of their decisions in preserving credit quality. I mean, at the end of the day, the Commissions decide capital structure, they decide ROEs, they decide regulatory mechanisms for capital recovery. And so, it's very important that they recognize that, as we do, that the credit quality is important and we felt like the equity structure in Colorado that we recommended is still appropriate based on our tax reform views or post tax reform outcomes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, Paul, I think you're also asking if we're making those recommendations, as Bob mentioned. But I think you're asking would we change our equity plans? The answer is the equity plans are what we share with the rating agencies and we don't anticipate changing those. What we hope is that our commissions follow our guidance, so that the credit ratings would be preserved.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. So for the most part, your plan will be pretty much intact one way or the other, if I understand you guys correctly?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Correct.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Correct.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Awesome. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Paul Fremont from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Thank you. Hi, guys. First of all, congratulations. Second of all, following up on Paul Patterson's question, I think Moody's was seeing consolidated 16% to 17% FFO to debt metric on a going-forward basis, is that consistent with what you're seeing as well?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Paul, it's Bob. Good morning. We share our forecasts with Moody's and S&P and Fitch, and I think that their forecasts are consistent with ours on an adjusted basis and they make certain credit adjustments for pensions or for other fixed capacity payments we make for power plants and PPAs and things like that to our underlying FFO to debt metrics. I think they also recognize that we have a very diversified holding company that spans eight states in multiple regulatory jurisdictions and they cited the benefit of that diversity in their ratings outcomes. And so we work with Moody's very closely on all of their calculations and their outcomes.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: So, I mean, if that plays out, is it reasonable to assume that there likely would be a potential change in the rating come a year from now?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Look, we've shared with them, their forecasts they put us on negative watch and they're going to continue to have conversations with us. I don't think there is a triggering action at this point for them. And so we're going to sit and watch and work with them and talk about what we think is a very solid, financial profile of our holding company.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Okay. And then my other question is when we think about sort of rebasing the growth as we get to the end of the year, would it more likely be – would it be like year-end numbers or how should we think about that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Paul, in the earnings release, we gave a base for the growth rate at $2.43, which represents the midpoint of our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47. We can always revisit that once actuals of 2018 are known, but that's the basis today.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Levi from ExodusPoint. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Hi. Good morning. Ben, you finally increased the growth rate. There you go.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Now what do we need to do, Andy?
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Continue, continue.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Just back – and I discussed this with Paul the other day. So, I think I understand it. But I think there were some questions with the two other Paul's, Paul P. and Paul F. Just as you look at the cash flows, I didn't really see it in the handout, but, I guess, as the wind comes on, you get into a negative tax rate situation, I think in like 2021 or something like that. And so that also will affect the cash flows as well. And I don't know if that's what Moody's is focused on as well, but don't you – isn't there like a $200 million or $300 million change in operating cash flow, because you get into a negative tax rate, but you still have to pay the PTCs. Am I correct on that, and can you just kind of talk about that? And I guess, the bottom line of the conversation I had last week was, your parent rating is so high, if it gets knocked down a notch, it doesn't really matter.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Andy, it's Bob. And good morning, and obviously, thanks for the continued support. We give Moody's our forecast, and I think their ratings and their calculations are based on that and it includes the impacts of the negative ETR that you mentioned. So I think they'll continue to watch the holding company, as they've put us on watch, and we'll keep working with them espousing why we think it's a solid credit there.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Andy, this is Ben, and just stepping back, that's not going to be, that's not the determinant factor in the ratings. I mean, they're looking at some of the actions that the utilities have taken and we mentioned New Mexico, we're keeping an eye on Colorado. In fact, I think Moody's is impressed with how we've run our holding company and they like the fact that unlike a holding company on top of a single operating company, we had four distinct operating companies operating in eight different states, I think with 21 different jurisdictions. They like the fact that we're purely regulated. They like the fact that we had economic customer regulatory diversity. So the holding company is a strength, not a weakness. And I think that's just important for our investors to understand.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Okay. I definitely do understand that. But just to make sure that I got it right last week, there is a reduction in the operating cash flow because of the way your tax rate becomes negative because of the PTC (46:38).
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Andy, the way to look at this is, we run the – when we generate PTCs, they flow back to the customer and the reduction in tax expense. To the extent that we don't fully utilize all those PTCs, there would be a cash flow impact and they would result on being added to the balance sheet and we earn a return on that.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And that's ...
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Right.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, that's baked into our financing plans as we've laid out here.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Right. And it was also baked into kind of what you showed the rating agencies, there really should be an issue...
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, exactly, Andy.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The real issue with the rating agencies is the fact that tax reform, when it was implemented, caused our FFO to debt go down by about 300 basis points. That's really what drove the change in the outlook, which is why we went to our commissions and generally said the best way to mitigate that is through higher equity ratios. And we've had some success and some things that we're still working on, and that's where we are.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: And if you don't get the higher equity ratios, as obviously with everything else we just discussed, that wouldn't change your equity plan, would it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The equity plans have been established with the rating agencies and what we're hope – and...
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: So, based on the equity ratios, you have right now, right, is that correct, or with...?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Short answer is, it's not going to change our equity plans.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. See you soon.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Bob Frenzel for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, everyone for participating in our earnings call this morning and continued support of the company. Please contact the Investor Relations teams with any follow-up questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, all.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 second quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2018 second quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filing with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another solid quarter with EPS of $0.52 per share compared with $0.45 per share last year. We're off to a great start this year and have raised our EPS guidance range to $2.41 to $2.51 per share from our original guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. Bob will provide more detail on our financial performance as well as the regulatory update. I will now briefly discuss some important recent developments. In May, we received approval in Texas for our SPS wind proposal. We now have final approvals from both the Texas and the New Mexico Commission to add 1,000 megawatts of new wind generation at SPS. Construction on the Hale site began this month and we expect it to achieve commercial operation in 2019. We're currently working on permitting and waiting for the transmission interconnection study for Sagamore, which is expected to go into commercial operation in 2020. As a reminder, the total capital investment for these two wind projects is $1.6 billion and it is included in our base capital plans. In addition, our 300 megawatt Dakota Range project was approved by the Minnesota Commission during the quarter. The estimated $350 million of capital investment is also included in our base plan. In June, we filed our Colorado Energy Plan, the most ambitious utility renewable plan in the country. It would allow our Colorado company to achieve a 55% renewable energy mix. We propose to add 1,100 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar and 275 megawatts of battery storage and retire 660 megawatts coal generation under our preferred CEP portfolio. The PSCo would own 500 megawatts of new wind generation, acquires 380 megawatts of existing natural gas generation and invest in new transmission for a total investment of about $1 billion. And please note that this CapEx is not included in our base capital forecast and represents incremental investment to our plans. Our preferred portfolio is based on a settlement with a diverse group of parties and balances company ownership with customer benefit. It will provide over $200 million of customer savings, while reducing carbon 60% in Colorado by 2026 from a 2005 base level. A Commission decision is expected early in September and we will update our capital forecast (03:43) and financing plans later in the year. We anticipate funding the Colorado Energy Plan, with a combination of internally generated funds, incremental debt and $300 million to $400 million of equity, if the Commission approves our proposal. And we expect most of the external financing to occur in 2020 and beyond given the build own transfer nature of the plan. So as you can see, we continue to make great progress on our steel for fuel strategy. Based on our approved projects, we're on track to have over 10,000 megawatts of wind on our system by 2021. In addition, approval of the Colorado Energy Plan would increase our overall wind capacity to approximately 11,500 megawatts, solidifying our position as the leading renewable generation utility in the United States while providing significant customer benefit. As a company, we strive to be an industry leader and provide a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply to our customers. Our people are the greatest resource and they're instrumental in achieving this goal. So I'm very pleased that Xcel Energy was included in the 2018 Forbes' Best Employers in America list, reflecting our continued focus on company culture and our employees. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and he'll provide more detail on our financial results and outlook as well as a regulatory update. Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We realized another solid quarter with earnings of $0.52 per share in 2018 compared with $0.45 per share in 2017. Impacts of weather, both hot and cold, increased electric and natural gas sales and increased earnings by $0.03 per share in the quarter. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share, including the impact of favorable year-over-year weather and rate increases in riders to recover our capital investments, partly offset by wind production tax credits to flow back to our customers and higher AFUDC which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers were higher O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.01 per share. Higher depreciation, interest and other items combined to reduce earnings by a total of $0.04 per share. Turning to sales, on a weather-adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales increased 1.1%, reflecting strong sales growth to our commercial and industrial classes and relatively flat residential sales. Year-to-date natural gas sales increased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis, reflecting continued customer growth and increasing customer use. Based on our year-to-date results, we've revised our annual weather-adjusted sales guidance to growth of up to 1% for electric and 1% to 1.5% for natural gas. Turning to expenses, our second quarter O&M expenses increased by $6 million, largely due to timing of costs at our generating plants. We've experienced the hot and wet summer, which has resulted in increased generation, unanticipated vegetation growth and extra stress on our system. While our respective systems have performed extremely well, we plan to invest incremental O&Ms to ensure that we continue to maintain the high levels of reliability that our customers expect. As a result, we expect our full year O&M expenses to be 1% to 2% higher over the prior year. Next, let me provide a regulatory update. Earlier this month, the Colorado Commission ruled on our natural gas case and upheld the majority of the ALJ's recommendation with a few exceptions. The Commission approved a rate increase of approximately $47 million based on a historic test year, an equity ratio of 54.6% and an ROE of 9.35%. We're disappointed with the Commission decision including their denial of a multi-year plan and a forward test year. To mitigate this impact, we have filed for an extension of our pipeline integrity rider through 2020. This will provide timely recovery of about half of our capital investment in the natural gas business. We've requested the Commission decision on our rider extension by November. Turning to our electric operations in Colorado, we're looking at two different timing options. We're prepared to file electric case in the fall with rates going into effect in mid-2019. However, we are working with parties on a potential alternative, which would allow us to delay the filing of our Colorado electric case until the spring of 2019 with rates going into effect in early 2020. We expect to have more clarity on our regulatory plans in the next few months. Moving to SPS, in June, we reached a settlement with various interveners in our Texas rate case in which there'll be no change in rates, as we will use the benefits of tax reform to offset our projected revenue deficiency. While it was a black box settlement, we agreed to use a 57% equity ratio and an ROE of 9.5% for AFUDC purposes. We will accelerate the depreciation of our Tolk coal plant and we'll continue to use the transmission rider to recover investments. We also committed to file a rate case by the end of 2019, which coincides with the in-service date of our Hale Wind Project. The Commission is expected to rule on the settlement in the third quarter. In New Mexico, we're seeking to increase our revenue by approximately $27 million including tax reform impacts and a 58% equity ratio and a 10.25% ROE. In June, the New Mexico Hearing Examiner recommended a rate increase of $12 million based on an equity ratio of 53.97% and an ROE of 9.4%. We anticipate the Commission decision in implementation of final rates in the third quarter. Next, I want to provide an update on the regulatory proceedings related to tax reform treatment. We are working closely with the Commissions to achieve balanced outcomes that provide customer benefit and also help us to maintain credit metrics in each of our operating companies. You can find a detailed discussion of each jurisdiction in the earnings release. So I'll just focus on a few recent developments. In July, the South Dakota Commission received a tax reform settlement, which includes a one-time customer refund of about $11 million in 2018. We will then use the benefits of tax reform to offset projected revenue deficiencies for 2019 and 2020. In Wisconsin, the Commission decided to refund $27 million and defer $5 million of the tax benefit until the next rate case proceeding. In Colorado, we reached tax reform settlement with the Staff and the OCC for our electric operations. The Commission approved a $42 million customer refund and directed an ALJ to provide a recommendation on the proposed $59 million of accelerated amortization of a prepaid pension asset. In Minnesota, we proposed to refund approximately half of the tax reform benefit, while utilizing the remainder of the benefits to accelerate depreciation of the King coal plant, recover MGP deferrals and avoid a rate case in 2020. We anticipate a Commission decision later this summer. With the first two solid quarters now behind us, we're $0.17 ahead of last year. It's important to note that although favorable weather has been a driver, we plan to spend incremental O&M, which will mitigate some of the positive weather impact. We're raising our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.41 to $2.51 per share from the previous range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share, reflecting our strong performance so far this year. With that, I'll wrap it up and overall it was an excellent quarter. We received final regulatory approvals for 1,000 megawatts of wind at SPS. We filed a proposal for the Colorado Energy Plan, which if approved would result in adding more renewable generation and continuing our clean energy transition. We reached constructive settlements in both Texas and South Dakota that resolved tax reform and rate deficiencies. Finally, we're well-positioned to deliver earnings within our revised guidance range while achieving long-term earnings growth of 5% to 6% and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually. This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll take a few questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the good results today.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just check in in terms of the mix of owned renewables versus renewables under PPA, just sort of broadly where we are in terms of that mix, where you see that over time, there's just been a lot of moving parts, I just thought I'd level set again on that.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Talking about most recently or just overall, Stephen.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'd say overall just to make sure we understand...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: ...kind of the overall mix.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. I see Bob flipping through some of our materials. So I will stall a little bit here. As you know, we started out not owning any renewable as we've been on this journey for quite a while now, but in recent years, last four years, we've owned more than we've acquired through PPA. Overall, we'd like to own, going forward, at least 50% of the renewables that come online. And that's what we've been – so we've been catching up over the last four years. Bob, were you able to find the exact number?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So Stephen, right now, we currently own about 850 megawatts out of 6,700 megawatts. Of the new amount that we've proposed, we would own about 74% (14:36).
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So it's fair to say you've – okay. And you have a long trajectory you had then in terms of being able to continue to look at the ownership option in terms of as you think about your overall mix?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Oh, absolutely.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Is that fair to say? Yeah. Just thought I'd check in on that. Great. And then, just on demand growth, understand kind of the near-term changes. Would you mind just talking at a high level in terms of the long-term trends you see in terms of the demand growth outlook in your service territories?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I'll let Bob add as well. I mean I think the trend we're seeing generally is we're seeing good customer growth, so new stores, if you will, but within those – that the customer usage, it's actually declining. I think primarily driven by energy efficiencies, some of which were leading to our own programs and I think that's a trend that will continue. Now, clearly, we're optimistic and want to help lead the clean energy transition, particularly as it relates electric vehicles, which will be great load for the utility industry. But I think the long-term trend is relatively flat sales going forward and that's what we're planning for.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Stephen, I'd just add that we've had good consumer industrial class sales, particularly in our Wisconsin and our Southwestern business over the past year. We are focused on economic developments. And what usually lags the large C&I sales is often residential sales. And I think you're seeing a pickup in residential in the Southwestern business as well, as the jobs and the opportunities continue to move into the Southwest. So we're buoyed by that. I don't know if I – I totally agree with Ben's overall assessment on trend, which is relatively flat for some period of time.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We're fortunate we have territories where we're experiencing good customer growth.
Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You're Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Greg. How was that Foo Fighters concert?
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: It was as usual freaking awesome. Did you guys see out there? (16:52) The trailing 12-month ROEs – earned ROEs across the whole company are improved from first quarter. Is that just because of the weather boost or are you seeing underlying improvement in gross margin as you continue to try to control costs?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Greg, it's a good question. It's weather growth. It was favorable sales in the first half of the year. I'd say there's some timing of equity. I think our full year regulated forecast looks slightly above 9% right now, and some of that's expected equity infusions into SPS as we increase the equity ratio there as well.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then, can you give us some more guidance on the effective tax rate situation and what's going on there?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, there's a extensive disclosure on where we are with our respective jurisdictions, and I won't go into all of them. I think the way we characterize the effective tax rate disclosure in the earnings release is, as we've given kind of two ranges, and as we work through regulatory settlements in each of our jurisdiction, our long-term rate is the effective tax rate looks probably like 8% to 10%. But with where we are with regulatory outcomes, we're still in that 15% to 17% with the differential being revenue and revenue retention. But longer term, it's in that single-digit number, high single digits.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: But your revenue requirements would ultimately reflect whatever tax rate you're – whatever your effective tax rate ultimately is or?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's exactly right. We put a pretty good disclosure in the earnings release around how we've recognized the lower tax rate, and then, we've changed the revenue assumptions accordingly, and you can see that give and take in the disclosure. And I just – what I said that our longer term tax rate was with single-digit, I meant for full year 2018, assuming full regulatory outcomes in all of our jurisdictions. Where we refund the benefits of tax reform to our customers, we'd expect that to be in the 8% to 10% range.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Got it. Thank you, guys. Have a good day.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Ben and Bob.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Morning.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I wanted to see if you guys could give us a little bit more color on the guidance change for the year. We're only about halfway through, even though we have another month of summer, in the books almost already here, by my calculation, the O&M increase alone could be another $0.03 to $0.04 or maybe even a little bit more of drag versus your original guidance, so that would offset a lot of the weather year-to-date. So are other things just going right for you that you feel confident at this point or is there something we're missing?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, no I think that's right, Chris. We expect when the weather turns favorable that we would invest. We do have higher needs, and so, we'll invest some of that back into our system. But other favorability, we've seen year-to-date sales favorability, year-to-date depreciation favorability from the pace of in-servicing and year-to-date favorability and expected favorability and property taxes and other items. And so with that, we feel comfortable with the increase in the range.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. And then, could you remind us of, I guess, the exact main date on you coming out of the Colorado electric settlement for filing, whether there was an agreement to file or whether there was a kind of optionality on your part and how that kind of led into this potential settlement that you're talking about now to delay the filing until I guess next spring?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Are you talking about under the multi-year plan from a few years ago, where we're required to file?
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, from the – I think it was the April settlement that you had on tax reform there.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You want to take that, David?
David L. Eves - Xcel Energy, Inc.: This is David Eves. So the April settlement, the Commission approved part of that. Excuse me, my mic was off. The Commission approved part of that and we're refunding $42 million per year to the customers. The balance, which was to go to the prepaid pension asset amortization, the Commission referred that to a judge.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think you're talking about – you're asking the question to file the general rate case and our decision whether to – what year and what the timing of that case would be and if we're required to do it. Is that your question? I think we're...
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. You guys had mentioned that that's now potentially going to be settled with interveners or talked about with interveners to not file until early next year. And my understanding was that April tax settlement that you had this year had some kind of agreement in it related to when you would file in Colorado electric next.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Chris, I don't think in our settlement agreement we had agreed to file a case.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: (22:20) the case.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We expect to file a case for revenue purposes and the settlement or the discussions we're having with stakeholders around when and how and what to file is really more around exactly those three questions, not necessarily whether we have to file. We had an obligation to file in 2018 – or 2017 under the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act. We did file. We indicated that we didn't have a significant revenue need in 2018, but that the revenue need would be larger in 2019 and 2020, and we're working with all the stakeholders to come up with a plan and a proposal to move that electric case forward. But there's no obligation on our side that we reached in the April agreement on tax reform.
Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Got you. That's clear. Thanks, Bob.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, good morning.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question I wanted to clarify, when you talk about the 5% to 6% growth rate on earnings going forward, should we base that off your higher 2018 guidance right now, is that fair that off that higher base we should see 5% to 6% going forward?.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, no Ali, we're talking – you should base it off of last year. That's what we're basing our 5% to 6% long-term growth rate on. That said, I think we are well-positioned in this forecast period, the five-year forecast period, to be at the top end potentially exceeding that 5% to 6% range. Clearly, the approval of the CEP plan would be helpful in that goal.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And also Ben, is it fair to say that somewhat linear that we should see that kind of growth rate year-in and year-out or how do you see that trajectories over that four-year, five-year plan?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, I think there's a bit of volatility in that number, but I don't think it's significant. I mean I think we expect to be in and around, as Ben said, the high end of the range and potentially exceeded. But there'll be some years where we'll be below it, in some years, we'll be above it. It won't be 6.000%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah, got it. And then, on the Colorado...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: If it were, you should be skeptical.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. It's fair enough. Yeah. On the Colorado gas case, when you look at the fact that they modestly reduced the authorized ROE as well as the equity ratio, one, was that a somewhat of a surprise and should we sort of think that when you do get to file the Colorado electric case so that would have implications, i.e. some reduction potential for ROEs and equity ratios on the electric side as well?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I would say, if I remember right, that was a two to one decision. So that wasn't a unanimous decision by the Commission to bring it down to 9.35%. And as Bob said on his prepared remarks, we're disappointed with that. We run a top quartile utility in terms of cost, reliability and safety. And I think as everybody knows that takes investment and that's exactly what we're trying to do in Colorado and other jurisdictions. And long-term, you need good constructive regulatory outcomes to continue to be a top quartile utility, which is what we want to be. So that was a disappointment. But Ali, the treasury rates continue to rise and I think we'll have to have continued dialogue with our Commissions about the need for – that ROE does matter in our business. So what it tells me we need to do is we need to be more persuasive and communicate better the importance of good regulatory outcomes to achieve the kind of results that I think our customers really appreciate and benefit from.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think I'll just add a thing to that, Ali, which is as part of the gas case, we did agree to defer the TCJA impact to a separate proceeding and we've got another opportunity to work with the Commission and the staff on the impact of tax reform on our credit in Colorado. And so, we have another opportunity, and our proposal is to raise that equity ratio to 57% and we'll do that in that follow-on tax proceeding.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And from a timing perspective, would that potentially get wrapped up before the electric proceedings, because beside the coal, the electric equity ratio right now is 56% which would be higher than where the gas was currently authorized to be?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think the proceedings will be bifurcated. I think our schedule for the gas tax reform proceeding is hearings in August – the filings in August, hearings in September, and a Commission decision later this year.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the good result year-to-date.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. So maybe, if I can, can I follow-up on Ali's questions a little bit on the Colorado case and just if you can expand on your thoughts as to the implications to the electric case specifically on a multi-year and forward-looking terms and perhaps elaborating on what alternatives or mitigation plans. You already described to a certain extent the mitigation strategies on the gas side. Can you talk about some of the levers on the electric side as well if possible? Or how you see that kind of flowing through?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, we're talking right now about the timing of the rate case and how we would file that. So I mean those discussions are already ongoing. Our history there is we've had two successful multi-year rate case filings. So I don't think we're breaking new ground if we choose to file a multi-year plan. I also would say, I mean, I think we've got opportunities to move that ROE up. And if you look at, I think, the perception of the Commission on ROE, they tend to think that the gas side of the business can get by, if you will, don't necessarily agree with, but get by with a lower ROE. So I wouldn't use the outcome in the gas case as the proxy for how the electric case is going to go.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And to be clear, actually, the mitigation plan you described for the gas side of the equation, did that meaningfully change your CapEx at all? I mean I suspect not, right, I mean you're largely intending to continue to spend at the same level?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I know if you don't get good recovery in the long-term, you have to adjust for it, but it should not impact our short-term plans. And remember, we also filed for a pipeline integrity rider, which covers about half of our CapEx. So we've got another bite of the gas apple, if you will, too in addition to tax reform, the tax reform filing Bob mentioned.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. And just a quick follow-up here on EVRAZ as an industrial customer, I know that there have been some headlines around this through the course of the year. Are there negotiations ongoing about the tariff there? And to the extent to which that there've obviously been some tariff changes and helping out the prospects of steel customers nationally, how does that impact the situation there and potentially the viability of that customer for you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thanks for the question, Julien, something I'm really – we are doing I think a very innovative deal for EVRAZ, which is located just outside of Pueblo, and employs I believe 1,000 people that is innovative. And it gives low cost renewables to the steel mill, which allows them to expand versus contract. We've developed the program. I think it's great when you can use renewables that help an industrial stay economic. And I'm really proud of it. And it is part – it is tied into our overall preferred Colorado energy portfolio, which in itself I think is incredibly innovative. I mean we're saving customers $200 million and that's on top of an ERP plan that already leans heavily on renewables. And if you looked at what a traditional thermal RFP would be if we want the fossil route to replace or to provide additional capacity of 450 megawatts, it would – we're saving $500 million there. So this is $200 million on top of that. So – and then, we do a deal that you mentioned for EVRAZ. I'm pretty proud of what we're accomplishing, not to mention the environmental benefits, which 55% of renewables, 60% carbon reduction. I can't be more proud of the team for what they've put together for our customers in Colorado. And we didn't – we're not developing, if you will, special tariff. We're using existing rate structures within Colorado. Is that right, David?
David L. Eves - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you. Did I answer your question?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Since you mentioned it, I mean...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: (32:05) went on a little bit of a ramble there.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: No. But since you mentioned it, I mean you talked about not using a special tariff here. I mean they're clearly your largest industrial. I mean, are there others who are going to look at this and follow their lean on sort of following you guys with the special renewable deal.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, because this is pretty unique to the site. This is essentially a behind the meter solar opportunity. I think it's like 200 megawatts, isn't it?
David L. Eves - Xcel Energy, Inc.: 240 megawatts.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So it's – I don't know necessarily if it's replicable. That said, we want to have those kinds of discussions with our Commissions. But again, this is a pretty unique deal, very innovative.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Actually, just quick follow-up related to that actually. On the solar ITC commence construction, I mean, obviously, you've got several hundred megawatts of solar pending under the Colorado Energy Plan. Can you comment a little bit about potentially expediting some of the solar CapEx just given what seems like obviously a generous package of ITCs available into the early 2020s now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, it is, but I view solar a little bit differently than wind Julien. And then, I think with wind, we're probably locking in with the 100% or in the case of Dakota Range, the 80% PTC wind prices that as those PTCs start to diminish and ultimately fall off, I think it'll take the technology a while to catch back up and – a decade. And I don't bet against technology, but I think that's probably where we are. So we want it to lock into that economic energy source. Solar, of course, has a capacity element to it. And I believe solar is going to continue to fall in price and very quickly offset the fall off of the ITC. So I'm more inclined to match our solar resources with our capacity needs. And as you know, our capacity needs tend to be more in the mid-2020s and beyond. So we're doing some solar, but as you know, we made an alternative recommendation in our preferred portfolio in Colorado, which would just go a little bit lighter on solar and some of the storage elements, because we think the technology is going to continue to improve and we'll have other opportunities to lock in great prices.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Well, thank you all very much. Best of luck.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning. Thank you. Hi. One more follow-up here on the Colorado issue. If you were to get a disappointing outcome in the electric case, and then, we can classify disappointing in however you want to think about it, how would that impact potentially the investment that you make in the Colorado Energy Plan? Could you see perhaps taking it down a bit?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, there's different degrees of disappointment, right?
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Sure.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: But I mean, I think, within a reasonable zone, I don't see us – we would move forward with this plan. We'd have to look at what the revenue requirements and how they relate to the rest of our business.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So I mean, I don't see that – I don't – I think if the – I think you can count on us. Let me answer this way: you can count on us. Barring some really extreme circumstances, we'd move forward with the CEP plan. And we do expect it to get approved and we're excited about where it's going to put us in terms of the environmental improvements we're going to make on the behalf of our customers.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. It's good. And then, a broader question here, if we look beyond what you're doing on the wind side in Colorado and the new projects there in the Southwest, how much more wind capacity is available and I don't mean capacity in terms of megawatts. I mean just integrating on your system, how much more wind could you put on your system? Is it another...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah that...
Travis Miller - Morningstar: ...could you double it? Could you triple it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I don't think you can double or triple it. I think what you'd be more inclined, as some of the older wind projects start to roll off, you upgrade through repowering. But when I look at where we'll probably focus on in the 2020s, it'll probably be more oriented towards solar as, again, we start to need the capacity to replace retiring coal plants. Doesn't mean we can't do more wind. We will, but as I've said before, Travis, this was the opportunity to buy wind on sale and I don't think that prices are going to be this compelling for a while. So we really – we loaded up.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Jonathan?
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. A lot of my things were asked, answered. But just on the Colorado plan and some of the Staff commentary that you had in response, any thoughts around the issues raised and whether you could see the plan evolving through the process, so how confident are you it's going to emerge as filed?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean the Staff said it was a viable option.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And they had some questions about what the actual level of savings are, but back to my earlier comment, I mean this is a great place to be. When we're talking about well, maybe the savings aren't going to be as high as what your modeling assumption is, of course, modeling has many different assumptions in it, but the reality is, I mean we're talking about saving customers money while replacing a coal plant and improving the environment. I mean, it's just an amazing story. So yeah, I'm really excited about it and I have to believe our Commission is really excited about it too.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just reading some of the discussion, it sounds like the delays were largely attributed to having more solar and storage a bit than you anticipated and complexities of modeling that. Is that sort of the right read of what went on here and how are you sort of thinking of working that going forward, as you try to sort of adapt to that new resource effectively?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, we wanted to get it right. And there was a lot of different bids that came in and a lot of – and the Commission, of course, asked for different scenarios and iterations than we wanted to be responsive to that and it took time, that's all the delay was about.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just one (39:10) you've said that we should still think about the 5% to 6% to the high-end and potentially exceeding that off of last year. Are we talking about 2017 actual or 2017 guidance? I just don't recall what you've said is the starting point.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's off of actual.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: 230 (39:28), Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: 230 (39:29). Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, how are you?
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Hey, guys. How are you doing? I'm doing well. You guys are doing really well, as always.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Andy.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: As always. Cooking along here. Best performing stock today. So obviously, a lot of my questions were asked and obviously someone also asked the growth rate question several times. So I get all that, it's good answer. The only thing that I want to discuss I guess is just back to Colorado, just talking among my peers and talking to people on the sell-side, I guess, and you did talk about a little bit, but just again back to the equity ratio in Colorado. Is that something where we should be concerned about longer term that, I know you talked about the gas to equity ratio may be going up to 57% because of the tax reform? But just overall, there's been like a lot of chatter about the equity ratio possibly coming down in Colorado, which obviously wouldn't be good. So can you just kind of discuss that in a little bit more detail and kind of what the genesis of that? And when will we kind of know which direction ultimately it's going to go longer term?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Andy, let me give you just a little bit of perspective. We've been as high as an equity ratio in Colorado with 60%. The Commission and the Staff there have historically recognized that the strong credit profile of the company is important. We've been stepping down from 60% over many years. And then, this last rate case proceeding with both the gas and the electric, we had agreed to file with the Commission a lower rate than 56%, which is where we were in our last cases. And that was – we filed 55% and 55.25% respectively in those two cases, that was before tax reform. And so, we all recognized the tax reform challenges, the credit profiles of those companies a little bit. So we've asked in our proceedings whether they're in the case or whether they're in separate tax dockets to increase the ratio of that company to preserve its credit rating. Those are ongoing and I do think that over time, I think the trend that the Commission would like to see is the equity ratio to come down mildly, but I don't think I'd be concerned. I think we've been pacing it for the past five years or six years, but I do think we've taken a pause with regard to tax reform and we do believe in our recommendation to the Commission and the Staff 57% is actually the right number to be at for, for the time being.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Why is it that the Commission wants the equity ratio to come down? I mean obviously, at the high level, but kind of what's the thinking on that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, one thing I'd point out, Andy – this is Ben – is that that 60% ratio when we obtained that, that was – if you remember, back in the mid-2000s S&P was imputing capacity payments as a form of debt on the balance sheet. So we successfully argued that the equity ratio needed to be higher, again, from a credit metric standpoint. And over time, we actually purchased some of those PPAs or they've rolled off. And so, there was a legitimate reason why you could take the equity ratio down. I think now, to Bob's point, we've got another credit issue would say that the credit ratio has to be at least paused, and then, the 57% is the level we're recommending. There's always going to be a push/pull though, I mean that for the obvious revenue requirement reasons, so I don't think it's like a burning desire. I just think it's something that requires continued dialogue.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: Okay. And then, just on the credit issue, I mean I understand with tax reform, but does your Colorado utility actually have a credit issue or are you just kind of stating that just because of tax reform?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think, broadly speaking, tax reform, as we change bonus depreciation and the impacts on deferred taxes that your primary credit metrics of FFO to debt or CFO to debt all declined. And so, on a net-net basis, I think that absolutely our cash flow metrics for both S&P and Moody's have declined. And so, if we want to preserve the credit ratios of these companies, then, there's a couple of alternatives, one of which is to improve the cash flow and you can do that through accelerated depreciation, which we filed for in our Colorado electric utility and that's at the ALJ for determination if we can amortize the prepaid pension benefit that will have cash flow benefits and that will have credit benefits. The other way to do it is with equity ratios or higher ROEs, in our estimation, the higher equity ratio is the cheapest way for the customers to preserve the credit rating of that company and that's been our recommendation, some portfolio of both accelerated depreciation and higher equity ratios to preserve the credit ratios at the Public Service Colorado Company.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: But we're not in trouble, Andy, to short answer.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: No. No. No. I get that. I mean I guess there's just been a lot of chatter about it. I mean I guess my thinking is, I mean, if it's right or wrong, even with a lower equity ratio, I guess, you have enough things to kind of offset that in other parts of your business or CapEx like you said if you have to (45:14) be able to still achieve. If you lost 300 basis points or 400 basis points of the equity ratio, I would assume that you'd be still able to achieve the high end of your growth rate, is that correct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean – yeah, I mean – but all that – you have to work harder to achieve it obviously. You broke up a little bit, but I think you were saying if the equity ratio fell 300 basis points to 400 basis points, it wouldn't knock out our long-term growth plans. I mean it wouldn't be favorable for it, but we've got other things that – other levers to pull. So as you know, Andy, because you pushed us many times to raise that long-term growth rate, we don't plan for a perfect performance and everything when we put out projections. We like to run a conservative company. We do that in almost every aspect of the business, how we run the systems, how we plan for the systems, having margin in your credit accounts, making sure we have lines of credits that are always available. So I mean there is – I don't think there is any one thing that knocks – that derails us from our long-term growth rate.
Andrew Stuart Levi - ExodusPoint Capital Management LP: That's very helpful. And thank you very much for all the answers. I appreciate it. Have a – and stock's doing great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Andy. We appreciate your support.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: In terms of the – in Colorado again, you're talking about trying to either achieve a settlement such that you file in mid-2019 for rates in 2020 or you'll be filing sooner than that. What are you trying to achieve or what are the major items that would – that you're seeking such that you could delay the filing as part of these discussions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Vedula, thanks for the question. When you look back at our electric case that we'd filed previously and some of the guidance and some of issues that were heard from the Commission, there was a real desire for us to file both a revenue case as well as a rate design case. And there's some complications with doing that for some of the previously decided issues. We've already decided depreciation and revenue associated with the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act. We've got rider and revenue recovery associated with the Rush Creek assets that will go in service in October or November this year. And we have tax reform out there. And so, those three large considerations, factor in to how we want to approach our next rate case with the Commission. We want to satisfy their request, which is revenue and rate design, but there are some complications and we're trying to resolve some of them in advance of the rate case.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: Okay. I'm wondering in terms of the earned ROE in Colorado, as I recall it, there's been a gap of some materiality. Can you remind us in terms of either or whether it's structural or some other reasons for the spread between the earned ROE regulatorily in Colorado and the authorized and what can be done to get those more aligned?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Sure. Broadly speaking, Colorado, as well as some of our other jurisdictions have what I call – what I've historically called leakage in lag. There are some items that aren't recovered under our normal jurisdictional revenue. And then, there's lag in terms of capital implementation. So our gas business has historically been a historic test year, and so, there's lag associated with investments in the gas business. On the electric side, there are some items that we don't get full recovery on like a prepaid pension asset, which we historically have earned a debt return on. And so, that drives down the earned ROEs on a GAAP basis. When you think about it on a regulated basis, our electric company has earned at or close to its allowed regulated ROE. But there are some items that for regulatory purposes are non-recoverable. We're always working on trying to close that gap and we've done a decent job over the last couple of years and all of our companies to do that and we'll continue to work to close the differential between sort of our earned and are allowed.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: And going to SPS, the settlement you have here then provide a clear opportunity to materially close the gap that has been there previously.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So if you're talking about the wind settlements in both Texas and New Mexico, if you remember, we were very adamant with our respective Commissions around needing what we called concurrent recovery and I think that, in principle, in both jurisdictions, we receive that in order to put the wind farms in. The wind investment represents almost 40% of the capital base of those companies and so getting concurrent recovery or near concurrent recovery on 40% of your asset base will rise the earned ROE for the rest of the business and that's just mathematically factually accurate.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: Okay. One last thing. When will we know or when do you expect to be able to tell us whether, in fact, you have a settlement that defers the rate filing or if you're unable to achieve that and you have to accelerate the filing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I think in my prepared remarks, we said in a month or two. So I'd expect sometime in September we'll have a better idea and we'll be able to talk about it either in a press release or in conferences or in our third quarter earnings call.
Vedula Murti - Avon Capital/Millenium: Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bob Frenzel, Chief Financial Officer, for closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, everyone.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2018 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported first quarter earnings at $0.57 per share compared to $0.47 per share last year. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and we're well positioned to deliver on our 2018 guidance and our long-term financial objectives. Bob will provide details on our financial performance and a regulatory update in a moment. But I thought I'd share some recent successes and developments with you. I'll start with storm response. Minnesota's legendary artist Prince once sang, sometimes it snows in April. Well, that was certainly true this April. Two weeks ago, winter storm Xanto delivered over 15 inches of unwelcome snow. Our crews braved long hours in whiteout conditions on a weekend restoring power to all customers within 24 hours. Well, apparently, it can also get really windy in April. Last week, we experienced, as Bob Dylan once sang, trees bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze, as we experienced wind gust exceeding 80 miles per hour. Again, we restored power to all customers with similar efficiency. Our results show the planning and dedication of our employees, and why I believe, we have this best storm response in the sector. We were pleased to share our expertise with others in their time of need. In the first quarter, we deployed over 200 employees to Puerto Rico to help restore power and rebuild their system after Hurricane Irma. We worked side-by-side with 17 other utilities and FEMA providing mutual aid. I'm extremely proud of our employees, many of whom worked 16-hour days in this humanitarian effort, as well as those that remained behind in our service territories carrying on the normal system requirements. I'm also proud of the progress we've made in our nuclear operations. In 2017, our nuclear team had an exceptional year with our highest capacity factors since 2010 while simultaneously reducing costs by $25 million. And progress has continued into 2018. Our fleet realized a capacity factor of 100% for the quarter and continues to find operating and cost efficiencies. Their continued operational excellence is why we believe nuclear is a key component of our carbon reduction strategy for the Upper Midwest. We are working with our legislators in Minnesota to provide the commission with additional tools that they can use as they evaluate the future of nuclear plants in our next resource plant. The proposed legislation would allow the commission to establish an advanced determination of prudence for the projected cost of our nuclear operation, which provides certainty to both customers and the company. Now, the bill has passed both the Senate and House energy committees, and is on the floor of both chambers. We'll keep you posted on the bill's progress. Strategically, in addition to leading the clean energy transition and keeping our customers' bills low, we're focused on enhancing the customer experience. In the past few years, we've created an award-winning mobile app, developed industry-leading outage notification services, commenced our advanced grid initiatives in Colorado and Minnesota, and created customer choice programs for wind and solar. To further this customer initiative, we hired Brett Carter to the new role of Executive Vice President, Chief Customer and Innovation Officer. Brett comes to Xcel Energy with an exceptional background to support our customer goals. He most recently held senior leadership roles at Bank of America where he oversaw key business areas including operations, technology, and shared services, and he previously held leadership roles in operations, marketing, and technology at several utilities including Duke Energy. Brett brings a unique set of skills that will help us deliver an outstanding experience for our customers. Next, let me provide an update on our continued progress on leading the clean energy transition. We recently received approval from the New Mexico Commission on our proposal to add 1,230 megawatts of wind at SPS. The Texas Commission is scheduled to discuss our wind proposal tomorrow. Last week, we filed supplemental testimony addressing questions from the commission. We believe we are delivering a project with significant customer benefits and are optimistic that the commission will approve the proposal. We still have permitting and transmission interconnection studies to complete, but we are pleased where we are with our regulatory process. In addition, we are also making good progress on our Colorado Energy Plan. We crossed a milestone in March with the commission ruling to allow the company to submit a portfolio that considers a more aggressive transition of our coal fleet in Colorado. The Commission requested that we provide analysis of several portfolios, which reflect a retirement of either one or two coal units, as well as a recommended portfolio, and a least-cost portfolio. The ultimate determination of the approved portfolio will impact the capital investment opportunity. We received a strong response to the RFP with a high number of bids, many of which were at very attractive pricing levels and significantly lower capital cost than we initially expected. Based on the bids, our revised potential capital investment for the Colorado Energy Plan is estimated to be approximately $1 billion. And as a reminder, the Colorado Energy Plan is not reflected in our current capital or financing forecast. We will submit the portfolios in May and expect a commission decision on the proposal in August. Finally, we anticipate the Minnesota Commission will rule in our Dakota Range wind projects proposal shortly. If approved, this would bring our wind capacity to an industry-leading level in excess of 10,000 megawatts. These projects are all part of our Steel-for-Fuel strategy. Because of the strong wind resources in our service territories, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital cost could be more than offset by fuel savings. Finally, we increased our dividend 6% in February, which is consistent with our annual dividend growth objective of 5% to 7%. And I believe this is a reflection of the confidence we have in our long-term business plan and prospects. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We had a strong quarter with earnings at $0.57 per share, compared with $0.47 per share in 2017. While we're $0.10 ahead of last year, it was largely driven by $0.04 per share of weather and $0.03 to $0.04 per share of expense timing. Our first quarter results were in line with our internal forecast. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, including the impact of favorable year-over-year weather and rate increases in riders to recover our capital investments, partially offset by wind Production Tax Credits that flow back to our customers. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.03 per share; higher AFUDC increased earnings by $0.02 per share; and finally a $0.01 per share benefit from increased wind Production Tax Credits resulted in a lower effective tax rate, which flows back to our customers and doesn't have a material impact on net income. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, reflecting our capital investment program, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, and higher interest in other items combined reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Please note that we've excluded the impact of tax reform from our margin and ETR variation explanations as tax reform is largely earnings neutral, and would otherwise distort the trend in a line-by-line income statement analysis. For more detail, see our earnings release. Our first quarter weather-adjusted electric sales grew 1.1% reflecting strong growth of 1.8% in our commercial and industrial classes. Our weather-adjusted residential sales declined 0.6% as declining use per customer offset customer growth of approximately 1%. Weather-adjusted natural gas sales increased 1.7% in the quarter, reflecting continued customer growth and increased customer usage. And while our electric and gas volumetric sales were better than expected, our revenue mix was modestly unfavorable, and did not result in material margin improvement in our electric margin. Turning to expenses, our first quarter O&M expenses declined $23 million, largely due to timing of maintenance actions in both 2017 and 2018. We continue to improve the efficiency of our operations, particularly nuclear, which have offset cost increases in other areas. As a result, we continue to expect our O&M will be flat on an annual basis, although, we always seek to improve efficiency and lower cost for our customers. Next, I'll provide a regulatory update. In Colorado, we have a multi-year natural gas case, seeking $139 million increase over three years. Provisional rates were implemented in January subject to refund. In the quarter, the ALJ approved a settlement we reached with various stakeholders to reduce interim rates by $20 million in response to tax reform effects. We're awaiting the ALJ recommendation on our natural gas case and anticipate a commission decision shortly thereafter. In our electric case in Colorado, we reached a settlement with the Staff and the OCC to amend our procedural schedule, which would have postponed the implementation of provisional rates and updated depreciation expense from June of 2018 to January of 2019. However, given multiple moving parts and limited impact to the company, the commission dismissed the case and suggested we file a new rate case. Dismissal of the case will not have a material impact on our results as we had already proposed postponing the implementation of provisional rates from 2018 to 2019. This summer, we anticipate filing a new electric case that includes the impact of tax reform with provisional rates going into effect in the first quarter of 2019. We also have pending electric rate cases in Texas and New Mexico, which are in the early stage of the process. We anticipate commission decisions later in 2018. Please note there are additional details on each of these cases including in our earnings release. As we've previously discussed, each state in our service territory opened a docket to determine appropriate tax reform treatment. We provided detail on the regulatory status of tax reform in each of our states in our earnings release. So, I'll just focus on a few of the highlights. In Colorado, we reached a settlement with the Staff and OCC in which we identified a reduction in revenue requirement of approximately $101 million for our electric operations in 2018 as a result of tax reform. In the settlement, we proposed to refund approximately $42 million to customers in 2018 and the remaining $59 million will be used to accelerate the amortization of an existing prepaid pension asset. This is a good example of balanced treatment of tax reform that provides immediate customer benefit while reducing a regulatory asset and preserving cash flow to maintain credit metrics. The settlement is pending commission approval. Similarly, last week in Minnesota, we filed a proposal that recommends tax reform benefits are utilized for a combination of customer refunds, accelerated depreciation of our King coal plant, a deferral to enable a rate case stay-out, and funding of low income programs. The commission is anticipated to act on our tax reform proposal later this year. As I mentioned, we have pending rate cases in both Texas and New Mexico. We filed supplemental testimony and expect that tax reform will be incorporated into both cases. It's not my practice to get too technical on these calls, but I wanted to explain the nuance that we're likely to see in our income statement throughout the year. As you expect, tax reform will have an impact on our revenue and effective tax rate, which will create some complexity, but will not have a material impact on our net income. As determinations are made by our various commissions regarding the regulatory treatment of the excess deferred tax liability, our revenue and effective tax rate will fluctuate in tandem. In the first quarter, we recognized revenue, established an offsetting regulatory liability. Subsequently, our effective tax rate was higher than our previous guidance, so as to not have an impact on earnings. Our expectation is that our ETR will be lower as we begin to flow cash back to our customers. Accordingly, to improve transparency, we've added a table in the earnings release that provides additional detail on the components of our ETR. Obviously, if there are any questions, please reach out to our Investor Relations team for clarification. And with that, I'll wrap it up. Overall, it was an excellent quarter. We had strong operational performance. We've advanced our wind projects in SPS with approval in New Mexico. Our Colorado Energy Plan is progressing as planned and, if approved, we'll continue our clean energy transition with no incremental cost to our customers. We're making good progress in working with various commissions on the optimal way to return tax reform benefits to customers. Finally, we posted strong financial results for the quarter and are well-positioned to deliver earnings within our 2018 guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 cents per share. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hi.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. So, a couple of quick items here. With respect to New Mexico and the wind here, obviously, a little bit of a different decision than typically done in the context of rate base. How do you think about the earnings impact in terms of operating the plant on, let's call it, a quasi-merchant basis as you'd look at the approval? And I got a follow-up.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Julien, I mean, what we were seeking, as you know, is not – is more concurrent recovery of the investment. With investment this large when compared to the existing rate base, we thought that was essential to moving forward to projects. I believe we got that with what we agreed to in New Mexico. It's a little bit of a twist from what we originally proposed, but not much. I mean, we keep the PTCs, which are pretty significant, as you know until we file a rate case with the agreement that we won't overearn in that interim period. So, for us, I think that works pretty well.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Effectively, as far as we're concerned, we should largely assume that you're earning at your ROE on the current plant for capacity factor, et cetera?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. And, Julien, just to be clear, once the project goes into rate base after the rate case, it'll just be traditional earning a return on that rate base. So, it's just the interim period that we're selling into the open market.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Absolutely. And then secondly, could you comment a little bit on the Colorado Plan here, just with the rate case and the ability to refile this summer? How do you think about that impacting 2018 or 2019? It seems negligible, but I wanted to just check on the strategy and impact?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien. It's Bob. Yeah. With regard to the electric rate case in Colorado, we had already agreed with the OCC and the Staff to defer any interim rates from June to January of 2019. That reflects our view that the impact on margin in 2018 was de minimis and won't have an impact on our earnings in 2018. We expect to file the case and we're working through the particulars right now with updated year-end actuals for 2017 and with a look at items like tax reform, Rush Creek, and other items. And so we'll be prepared to file that expeditiously.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Lastly, just real quickly on the nuclear legislation. Can you give us a little bit of a sense here as to sort of what's on the table if you do not get this legislation done. I'm just trying to understand how important the clarity you need is in order to move forward with these investments, if you could elaborate a little bit?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think it's beneficial, Julien. It's an investment that has been frankly probably over scrutinized. That's very important to our 85% carbon-free energy goals by 2030 and we just want a little additional clarity, both from a consumer and a shareholder perspective that once we have a plan approved, that we have – kind of have confidence that if we execute on that plan, we're going to get recovery. Pretty simple. We're not asking for any sort of subsidy or anything like that. It's just – it's an advanced prudence determination essentially. Now, if we don't get, it doesn't mean things change, but I think, we hope, if we don't get it, that at least the dialogue is established that for an investment this significant and this important to these carbon-free goals, we need to have a fair shake when it comes to the regulatory process.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Excellent. Thank you all.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: We'll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hi, Ali.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question, can you remind us if the Colorado Energy Plan is approved as proposed by you guys that $1 billion, what (20:04) ? Will that money get spent? And how should we think about the funding for that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Ali. It's Bob. We're still working through the portfolio and the details and the timing of each of the assets that would be implemented as part of that plan. So, I can't give you a definitive answer. Suffice to say that there's wind projects that are seeking 100% PTC, so there'd be some assets that are likely included by 2020. There's some other assets that could come back further in the plan. So, the timing is still a little bit in flux. We're still working through that. We expect to file with the Colorado Commission an update in May, which will have some more details. With regard to the financing of that plan, it's obviously $1 billion investment that will likely need a modest amount of equity to support it. And again the timing of that will dictate sort of how much and when. So, give us some time to work through the details and the particulars. Once the commission reviews it, they're supposed to have it reviewed by August, which is in line with our normal capital planning process. And so we'd expect to include any capital updates and financing updates in our normal third quarter guidance discussion.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But, Bob, to be fair, I mean, you are looking at that as totally incremental. This wouldn't cause some other CapEx to perhaps move around or be taken out to be replaced by this?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I think if the $1 billion were approved, I think for the forecasted timeframe, all things equal, Ali, we would increase our rate base growth rate to about 7%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Okay. And then second question, just understanding the timing of the equity issuance. So, if I read it right, you're assuming $375 million of equity this year, $75 million from the DRIP program, $300 million separate. I guess, first question is that $300 million, should we think of that as the at-the-market sort of plan or could that be a quick block, how are you thinking about that? And then for 2019 and 2020, should we assume that the $75 million run rate continues through the DRIP annually?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Ali, those are both good assumptions. Our sort of case to beat on the equity plan is in at-the-market program late this year, could drift early into next year, but our expectation was to get it done this year. With regard to the DRIP. Yes, $75 million is a pretty good run rate. I think our previous guidance said it was going to be about $385 million over a five-year period. So, at $75 million, it grows to kind of $85 million run rate in the last year.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Okay. And last question, when I look at the earned ROE over the last 12-month period that you report at the OpCo level, it looks like the regulatory lag right now was (00:23:14) about 40, 45 basis points. Is that sort of the limit we should think about? Just a practical limit or can this earned ROE trend go actually higher than what you're showing us right now?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, we've made progress on closing that gap. We've probably narrowed it by about half when we set that out of the strategic goal. We've made a lot of progress. I think you should expect us to continue to work on that. There's some items – obviously filing rate cases helps the concurrent recovery that Ben talked about with SPS wind should help regulatory lag in general. But, for now, I think that's probably a pretty good assumption, but know that we're always looking to narrow it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, to Bob's point, Ali, it gets a little harder to close the remaining gap. There's the structural things and that sort of stuff. But, I mean, so as Bob mentioned, longer term regulatory compacts, I think we're doing a great job of finding cost efficiencies. Those all will contribute to it, but we've pretty much achieved the goal at this point.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And, Ben, am I right in the math, it's about 40, 45 basis points is where the lag is right now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Probably a little bit more than that, but you're real close.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We still have some more opportunity.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. I just have a real quick question. Well, first of all, congratulations on the solid quarter. But what exactly are you expecting in Texas tomorrow?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: (00:24:53). I mean, I think – as I said on the call, we think the projects drive tremendous benefits for consumers. We think there's a lot of support from stakeholders. There were some questions that were asked, and they've been answered, and so we're optimistic that the commission will approve it.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I was just asking if you're actually expecting an approval or more discussions? But it should be over by tomorrow.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You could always have more discussion, but our thought is that it's approval.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: We'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning. I was wondering as you go through and as the regulators commissions go through the whole return of this deferred tax liability chunk of money, how much are they looking at the earned ROE versus your allowed ROE and maybe using some of that money to close that gap, so to speak?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Travis, I think it's – they're more – if you have a deferral of rate cases, maybe there's some indirect look at that, but I don't think that's really their focus. I think their focus is on – like we talked about, refund a good portion of it immediately to customers and then look at longer term implications and things that make sense that will help our balance sheet, but will also help customers. So, paying off a prepaid pension asset in Colorado makes a lot of sense. Here in Minnesota, maybe accelerating some additional depreciation for our coal plant – the King plant and doing a little more with low income and maybe being able to stay out of a rate case longer. Those are all things that will benefit consumer and customer alike. So, I think that's where the focus is. And we're comfortable with it.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Great. And then just real quick, the strength in the Electric C&I usage, wonder if you could just elaborate on what's going on there? If it's a trend or if it's just a (00:26:58) type of thing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'll turn it over to Bob, but I'll just leave you with a three letter word, oil.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Look, we experienced C&I declines when oil prices dropped to below $40. And when oil is above $60, we see increased activity in our Southwest business and we see increased sand mining activity in our Wisconsin business, and I think that's the lion's share of the improvement in large C&I across the company.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Great. I appreciate the conciseness.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Fremont with Mizuho.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Thank you very much. I'm just trying to get a better handle on sort of the revised $1 billion estimate on Colorado Energy Plan. When I look at page 7 of your presentation, how much of each of those categories, in terms of megawatts, are you assuming in that $1 billion? Is it the full amount of 1,000 megawatts of wind, the 700 megawatts of solar, the 700 megawatts of natural gas, or is it something less than that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, you remember that the original objectives or goalposts, if you will, were 50% of the renewables, 75% of the fossil gas generation. We're going through a number of iterations right now, but we're comfortable that based upon what we think the recommended portfolio and additional options might be that we'll end up around that $1 billion, Paul. Not really too much – can't be too much more specific at this point as how much of it is wind, how much of it is solar, how much of it is gas, transmission, or battery, but we feel comfortable that collectively it will be around $1 billion.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: But in terms of megawatts, would it be less than the maximum here, and again, subject to the ownership limitations that you put out on the slide?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, it could – I mean, I will tell you, I think the trend will be that wind will probably be better for us to own than solar, and we were well-positioned on the fossil side. But I don't know if I can be much more specific than that.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And, Paul, just to be clear. The totals on slide 7 of our investment plan are totals for the entire Colorado Energy Plan. They weren't totals for our proportional ownership targets.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Right. Now, I totally understand that. And then is it also possible for you to give us maybe some parameters on cost per kW for each of those categories?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Paul, we filed – and I can point you to the filing, or we could get it to you later, but we filed publicly the median prices for various categories. We filed the bids in our 30-day update in January and then reupdated it again in February. And those are public, and we can get that to you if that's helpful.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Great. And then the other – last question for me is you talked about timing, I guess, for O&M and depreciation. Should we expect that for the remainder of the year? The makeup of sort of the lower spending in the first quarter will be sort of evenly spread or what's the pattern for the O&M to be made up and also the depreciation?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think for the O&M portion, probably even is probably the best way to think about it. On the depreciation, it's a little bit more backdated, largely impacted by the inservicing of our Rush Creek project in Colorado, which should happen in late October or early November. And that's sort of the big driver of the timing of the differential.
Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Angie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. I have one – how are you? I have one question, but numerous parts. So, given that you are developing numerous wind farms, I just wanted to get a sense, what has changed since the tax reform? Are you, for instance, seeing any changes with regard to the economics of the projects that you are developing, bidding behavior from developers? Do you feel the need, for instance, to tap the tax equity more often? Is there a sense, for instance, changes as a value of accelerated depreciation are making economics of these projects different to your customers? And also, the second part would be, given that you're adding so much renewables into your systems without necessarily retiring coal plants at the same time, how do you manage the O&M increase associated with the new renewables on your system? Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: All right. Let me – the first question, I believe, was how has tax reform generally impacted the economics of the renewable projects. Is that right, Angie? I'm going to assume that (00:32:24).
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: ...Yeah. And so, I would say that there has been some impact when you lower the effective tax rate to 21%. The value of the PTC and the ITC is not as valuable as it used to be. That said, these projects are deeply in the money, and we've also had the opportunity to go through and look at working the supply chain harder. And so, I'm really pleased with where we are. With all of our proposals and what we continue to see, by and large, at this point, developers have held their pricing pretty constant. I mean, I'm sure that supply and demand is changing a bit in the tax equity world. We continue to see the opportunities to own renewables as a rate base opportunity, and I think we're well-positioned for that. Now, ultimately, as you know, Angie, the PTCs and then ultimately the ITCs go away. And I think renewables will continue to come down in price, and while wind, I believe is on sale today, it ultimately will be competitive, I think, into the next decade. What was the second part of the question?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, Angie, on the second part of the question on O&M, you're right. Increased wind generation will add O&M pressure to the company. So, when I think about our goal to maintain flat O&M, it means that we're consciously and very aggressively working on the O&M on the rest of the business as we continue to lay new wind into our business. So, we have – as we've talked about in the past, we have natural O&M pressures from merit increases and bargaining unit wage increases. We're offsetting that as well as more to make room for the wind in our portfolio in advance of any retirements of any of our other generation fleet.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And remember, we do take advantage – O&M does flow through the riders, and so we put it into base rate.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: But when you talk about the customer benefit, just excluding any emissions, the main driver of a customer benefit through additions of wind farms is the cost of fuel would be going down for conventional power plants, is that right?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I look at it, Angie, as a deeply in the money hedge against fuel prices, exactly.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Okay.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, when we look at that, when we say – just to finish that thought. We look at – when we say that, it includes the O&M and includes ancillary costs. It's a full package, and it's still deeply in the money compared to where gas is, even with gas being at very low prices today.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And it is over, basically, the useful life of the wind farm, right? So, it's not – so, some of it could be back-end loaded when the coal plants that currently support the wind farm are retired and hence that O&M benefit shows up?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. It's over the life of the project. There is some element of the benefits being more front-end loaded. But, as you know, most people still have natural gas being more expensive in the out periods, too.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And for the project, and this is the last question, I promise. For the projects, for the wind projects that you will own, do you have any preference over self-development or build transfer type of option?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's a really good question, Angie. I think – all things equal, we think we have more flexibility and can do more things when we self-build. But we're open to build-own-transfer, and as you know, part of the near unanimous settlement that we obtained in Colorado was to for us not to offer self-build renewables, but to get our ownership through build-own-transfer. So, you always – there's different paths that take you to the same place and that's what you saw in Colorado.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Given the prominence of OpCo and for that matter HoldCo credit agency ratings with some other jurisdictions for other companies in the tax reform discussions, I'm wondering if you can give us any sense as to how that might play into your discussions at SPS in both Texas and Minnesota, knowing that it is, I think, relatively early stages in that process for you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, it's a great question, and I know even before tax reform, you've heard me and other members of the management team talk about the fact that we'd like to have dry powder, right? We don't take things close to the edge. We have a more conservative dividend payout ratio than many other companies. We've got margin in our credit metrics. We have margin in our operating capacities. So, tax reform certainly had an impact on credit metrics. We are committed to our credit standings. That's why we're talking about $300 million worth of equity, and we also think it's important to have those dialogues with our regulators on what they need to do to help support the credit metrics that are so important for us to make the capital investments that bring economic development or economic benefits and sometimes development to the communities that we serve. We proposed in SPS, an equity ratio of 58%. We think a better equity ratio, particularly in SPS, is needed to support the credit metrics there. In Minnesota, specifically to your question, we think the accelerated depreciation associated with King has twofold benefits. It supports credit metrics through more cash flow, but it also gets a – it more quickly accelerates an asset that ultimately we are open to potentially retiring before it's the end of its service life currently scheduled. So, Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I think Ben hit on all of high points, and we've had discussions in our other regulatory jurisdictions as well.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess bigger picture question on the trajectory in Minnesota from a regulatory and maybe a political perspective as well. We've seen some more extreme intervener positions of late on ROE and other factors, maybe a little bit of inconsistency in commission rulings for some of your peers, and you're coming up on the end of your multi-year plan at the end of 2019. So, how do we think about how things have changed, if at all, and how your strategy might flex accordingly?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean as part of what we could do with tax reform is stay out another year. We do think multi-year plans have been demonstrated to be a success. Our cases increasingly would be for capital recovery, done a really good job with O&M. And I do believe that the commission really supports what we're trying to do in our carbon reduction programs, our pilot programs, or things like support EV or electric vehicle implementation. So, I think, the strategic direction we're taking is supported by our commissions. You can always have some bumps in the road, but when you're aligned like that, I think long-term, you're in pretty good shape.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So it sounds like nothing to be overly concerned about at this point given the broader picture.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I would say that's correct.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Ben.
Operator: And with no additional questions, I'd like to turn the call back to CFO, Bob Frenzel, for closing comments.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, all, for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: That does conclude our call today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy 2017 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's conference, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Johnson, please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 year-end earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team available to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2017 results, discuss tax reform, and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filing with the SEC. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain ongoing earnings metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Our ongoing earnings and EPS exclude a $23 million or $0.05 earnings per share one-time charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The comparable GAAP measures, a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of these charges are included in our earnings release, which is available on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning to everyone. I hope everybody enjoyed the Super Bowl. We certainly enjoyed hosting it in Minneapolis. Glad the lights stayed on. And while our Vikings weren't in the Super Bowl, it was a fun event. And I think at Xcel Energy, we had a Super Bowl year in 2017, performing fantastically financially, strategically, and operationally. I wanted to start with some of the key accomplishments and recognize the outstanding efforts of our employees in 2017. We successfully completed CapEx 2020, a 13-year project entailing over 800 miles of transmission lines, $2 billion of investment and working with 11 different utilities. Our nuclear operations have one of its best performance years, achieving a capacity factor of 91% while reducing refuel outage times and lowering cost. Xcel Energy was named the number one utility wind energy provider in the United States by AWEA for the 12th consecutive year. We were named a Military Times Best for Vets Employer for the fourth consecutive year, ranking 19th on a list of 82 companies that received that honor. We successfully completed our multi-year SAP implementation, which included a new general ledger and work asset management system. This is part of our productivity through technology initiative, which will drive efficiency and lower our cost structure. And not to diminish our financial results, we had another strong year with ongoing EPS of $2.30 in 2017, which is the midpoint of our guidance. This was our 13th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. Finally, we also raised our dividend by 5.9%, which represents the 14th straight year we increased our dividend. Tax reform is all over the news, and I wanted to give you our high-level overview of the key points; and Bob will provide more details later. We believe that tax reform is beneficial to our customers and will result in lower revenue requirements, which provides the opportunity to reduce customer bills, make additional investments in areas that are important for our customers, and take actions to preserve our credit ratings. We expect tax reform will be mildly accretive to our earnings over the next five years, as it essentially adds approximately $1.3 billion to our rate base. We are reaffirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47; and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 6%; and dividend growth of 5% to 7%. Finally, we do not anticipate any changes in our strategy to lead the clean energy transition while keeping customer bills low. We introduced our Steel-for-Fuel strategy back in 2016, and it's been a great success; and let me provide you with some recent updates. Last year, we introduced our Colorado Energy Plan. The plan which is supported by a wide range of stakeholders calls for the addition of up to 1,000 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of solar, and 700 megawatts of natural gas or storage, as well as the early retirement of two of the coal units at our Comanche plant. This is an opportunity for Xcel Energy to continue to transition its energy supply portfolio in Colorado with no increase in customer bills. Implementation of the Colorado Energy Plan will allow us to achieve by 2027 an energy mix of 55% renewables and a 60% carbon reduction. In November, we received bids from our RFP. While we're still in the process of evaluating the bids, we were pleased with the robust number of bids and the attractive pricing. We were pleased to see the levelized median bids from wind coming in at approximately $18 per megawatt hour, while solar proposals were just under $30 per megawatt hour. Bidders have just responded to the option to refresh their pricing for tax reform and solar tariff considerations. Hearings are scheduled for this week, and we expect a commission decision on a settlement in March. Assuming the commission approves the settlement, we will file a recommended portfolio in April with a final commission decision expected this summer. Next, I'll provide a quick update on our SPS wind proposal, which includes 1,000 megawatts of our self-build wind in Texas and New Mexico, and a 230-megawatt wind PPA. In New Mexico, we reached a settlement with various parties, which has been filed with the commission. Hearings on the settlement were held in December. At the request of the hearing examiner, we provided analysis of the effective tax reform, which clearly shows the project still result in meaningful customer savings. We've also reached a settlement in principle with parties in Texas and are working on finalizing the documents. There are no significant issues outstanding, and we plan to file the settlement with the Texas Commission shortly. We expect final decisions from both commissions by the end of the first quarter of this year. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on full-year 2017 results and for details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release. As Ben indicated, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance and deliver 2017 ongoing earnings of $2.30 per share compared with $2.21 per share of ongoing earnings in 2016. The most significant earnings driver for the year include a higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.19 per share largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments, lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.12 per share. Please note the lower effective tax rate is partly due to an increase in wind production tax credits, which flow back to our customers through electric margin. Lower O&M expenses and a higher AFDC equity combined to increase earnings by $0.06 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.21 per share, and higher interest expenses, property taxes and other items netted to reduce earnings by $0.07 per share. Turning to sales, our weather and leap year-adjusted electric sales increased 0.1% for 2017. Natural gas sales increase 2.7% in 2017 on a weather and leap year-adjusted basis. Our 2017 gains in electric and natural gas sales are largely driven by the large C&I segments across our operating companies. We continue to see positive customer growth in our service territories for both the electric and the natural gas businesses, but that growth has generally been offset by lower use per customer, primarily in the residential sector, largely attributable to improvements in energy efficiency. We realized another strong year of cost management as we continue to improve efficiency across our businesses. We improved operations and lower costs, predominantly in our nuclear and fossil generation fleets and we're able to offset the $0.04 adverse impact of weather in 2017, as compared to normal. Our commitment to continuous improvement in productivity through technology has resulted in our 2017 O&M expenses being slightly below 2014 levels. This is consistent with our longer term objective of keeping O&M flat across all of Xcel Energy. Now, let me provide a quick update on our pending rate cases. In Colorado, we have an electric case seeking $245 million rate increase over a four-year period. Interim rates are expected to be effective in June of 2018. We also have a multi-year natural gas case in Colorado, seeking $139 million increase over a three-year period. Interim rates were implemented in January. We have a pending electric case in Texas seeking a net rate increase of $55 million. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of 2018 with final rates to be implemented retroactively to January of 2018. And finally, we have a pending electric case in New Mexico seeking a $43 million rate increase. We anticipate a decision and implementation of final rates in the second half of 2018. All of these rate proceedings were filed before the new tax legislation was proposed. In these cases, and in other jurisdictions, we're having active discussions and formal proceedings with our regulators regarding the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how we will provide the expected benefits to our customers. As we progress through these conversations, we'll keep our stakeholders apprised of the outcomes, which we expect to be constructive. With that, let me spend just a few minutes on the potential impacts of the new law. For more information, please see our earnings release, which has an extensive disclosure. However, let me start with a few key takeaways. As Ben said earlier, we believe tax reform is beneficial to our customers due to lower revenue requirements. We also expect to be able to offset the lower tax yield on holding company debt and deliver on our earnings guidance this year. The lower corporate tax rate reduces the value of the wind production tax credit to our customers. However, we have identified offsets in our projects and they continue to remain very beneficial to our customers. Finally, in a static analysis, the tax law changes will reduce cash from operations and adversely impact our credit metrics. However, any near-term impacts will be largely dependent on regulatory actions taken as a result of the new tax law. We're very focused on credit quality and maintaining a strong balance sheet, which provides our company's access to capital at reasonable terms and reduces the cost of capital for our customers. We're actively working with our regulators to develop plans and alternatives, which would provide our customers with the benefits of tax reform while maintaining strong credit metrics. Some of the potential actions include: accelerated asset depreciation or amortization; higher authorized equity ratios, or ROEs, at our regulated utilities; deferral or avoidance of future rate cases; and potential additional investment in areas of focus for our regulators. Ultimately, tax reform results in lower taxes, lower deferred taxes and, correspondingly, lower cash flow metrics. And in response, we expect to moderate our five-year capital expenditure plan by $500 million and issue up to $300 million of additional equity. Even with the reduction in capital expenditures and the modest equity issuance, we project rate base growth of 6.5% and our earnings growth will be at the upper end of our 5% to 6% target. The ultimate amount of any equity issuance and changes in capital expenditures will depend on regulatory actions of our various state commissions. We anticipate that these revisions to our plan and implementation of some of the proposed regulatory actions will result in a consolidated FFO to debt of 17% to 18% over the five-year time period prior to any rating agency adjustments, and should be sufficient to maintain strong credit ratings. With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2017 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 13th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 14th straight year. We realized a 1% decrease in O&M expenses. We resolved several regulatory proceedings, including: a multi-year electric case in Minnesota; decoupling an advanced grid proposals in Colorado; and an electric and natural gas case in Wisconsin. We continued to execute on our Steel-for-Fuel strategy. We received regulatory approval for 1,550 megawatts of new wind in the Upper Midwest, proposed to build a 300-megawatt wind farm in South Dakota, and reached settlements in principle for the 1,230 megawatts of wind in Texas and New Mexico. We reached a settlement with a diverse group of stakeholders on the Colorado Energy Plan, which proposes the addition of renewable projects and the retirement of two coal facilities. We are well-positioned to deliver on our 2018 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share, our 5% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll take any questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Operator, you there?
Operator: And for our first question, we go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. This is Josephine actually hopping in here for Julien. Congrats on the results.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. Good morning.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I just have a quick question. I think you said that with tax reform your new rate base growth that you're looking at is 6.5%, hitting the upper end of the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate. I was wondering, with the Colorado Clean Energy Plan, what is then the further CapEx upside from that translate into your new rate base growth?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So the question is if CEP, which is not in our base CapEx...
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Exactly.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: ...if that's included, what will that do to rate base grow growth?
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Exactly. Like how much further up can it go?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think that really depends on what we see in ultimate and final bids from the process, which are still pending. I think a good estimate is probably 50 basis points higher in rate base CAGR.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Great. And then, just on the equity issuance. You just said $300 million in additional to the $385 million that you had announced, I think, on the third quarter. Would that then still be as part of the DRIP? Are you just expanding the DRIP?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I don't think the DRIP at $385 million, as we indicated in our third quarter call, was likely sort of the large size of the dividend reinvestment program. I think the $300 million we'd contemplate in a market issuance.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, great. And then, one last question. Just – I think you had mentioned earlier in 8-K that you were thinking of trying to increase the equity ratio as part of the tax reform mitigation strategy. Have you had any conversations with the commissions on that subject and do you think that's a possibility?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, this is Ben. I think we've had obviously preliminary, but constructive dialogues with all of our regulators. And I think the importance of strong credit ratings is not lost on them, so higher equity ratio is a dialogue we're having at SPS. And I think there'll be other dialogues around higher equity ratios potentially, maybe increased amortization which also contributes to cash flow. And I think our regulators are going to look at tax reform. Everybody recognized the benefits to the consumer, but I think they're going to also make sure that balance sheet stay strong. So, we're encouraged by what we've heard so far.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And that's not yet like the assumptions of a higher equity ratio are not yet reflected in that 5% to 6% EPS growth rate, right?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean that's – I think one of the things that we would hope for is that if the $400 million of revenues that we're going to stream ultimately back to the consumers if we get higher equity ratios, et cetera, that could help offset the tax yield difference that we have at the holdco.
Josephine Moore - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hi, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): I was wondering on the tax reform stuff again, what's the chance that incorporating those in rate and getting into the regulatory process might delay some of the decisions and some of the rate increase that you're expecting in 2018 and even maybe early 2019. Give me a sense of timing there and how regulators are approaching that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Travis, it's Bob. We've had a lot of constructive dialogues across almost all of our jurisdictions at this point, particularly the ones where we've got pending rate cases with Texas, New Mexico and the two cases in Colorado. I think the regulators and the stakeholders in all those cases are contemplating the impacts of tax reform either as parts of those cases or as adjuncts to those cases. So, I don't think it impacts the timing or the estimate of our rate case revenues that we're expecting in either 2018 or 2019. I guess the one consideration I'd say there is our filed case or our filed testimony in South Dakota contemplates potentially we're under-earning in South Dakota and it contemplates potentially not filing a rate case as part of tax reform.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Okay. And what about Minnesota, how would you go about the regulatory process there given the...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, there'll be a docket in Minnesota, Travis, to discuss the effects of tax reform. We're still in the multi-year plan, but we'll figure out a way to account for that either through an accounting deferral or some actual actions. In Colorado, that's your next question, we're having dialogues right now as we're in an active rate case and we have settlements, not unanimous settlements, that we'll be presenting to the commission. And back to my earlier comment about constructive dialogue, I think our commissions appreciate that we're bringing them options. And, essentially, this is complicated, educating them on the full holistic implications of tax reform.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay, great. That's all I had.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Travis, one other thing I'd just say is I'd point you to the earnings release. We put an entire page of where we are in dialogue with each of our regulatory jurisdictions. That should give you a pretty good guide as to the conversations we've had to-date and where we expect those to go over the next sort of three to six months.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay, great. Perfect. Thanks so much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Travis.
Operator: And for our next question, we go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan.
Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine Lednev on Jonathan's behalf.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Everybody's got their proxies on the call today. I guess we're the second priority.
Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: (21:44). Actually, just a quick question on the equity issuance. The 2018 guidance doesn't assume a share count and you mentioned the $300 million of incremental issuance. Is that going to be spread over the five years or is it kind of more lumped together to the front or the back end somewhere?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We haven't actually spent a lot of time on pinpointing exact dates. It's probably more front-loaded than back-loaded, but it really will depend on the conversations with both the regulatory agencies and how we approach tax reform and credit in our operating companies, as well as the conversations we have with the rating agencies following those conversations. So I wouldn't expect it to be backdated, but we do affirm that the $2.37 to $2.47 is good for this year.
Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And I guess the same comment goes for the $500 million of CapEx, right?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, similar comments. Again, I'd say the capital is probably a 2019, 2020, 2021 issue. Most of the stuff in 2018 is underway and in progress, but I think that any trimming of capital is probably a little bit more backdated in the plan.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think too, just to add to that $500 million, it's really maybe a quiet story at Xcel, but we are really improving our supply chain efficiency. You're seeing that in our results with O&M, but you're also going to see that in our ability I think to, on a per unit basis, get things done more efficiently. I can't be more pleased with how well our nuclear operations are performing both operationally and financially. And when you become more efficient, you can get more done with less capital. So we don't have any specific projects targeted to take out now. We just know there are opportunities to do that.
Constantine Lednev - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Yeah. I think the other questions are already answered both in the remarks and in Q&A, so thanks.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: For our next question, we go to Joe Zhou with Avon Capital Advisors.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Hi, it's Andy Levi, guys. How are you doing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, hey. So you are the real deal now.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: All real. Everyone is a real deal. It's just next time you schedule your call, maybe you don't want to do it when there's another company doing a call. That may be...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Maybe they don't want to schedule it when we're doing our call.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Vice versa. Yes, it goes both ways. Anyway, just two clarification questions because I've kind of been popping on and off. So just on the $300 million of incremental equity, I heard the initial comments just a moment ago. So what you're saying is – because I'm just trying to get a sense of timing – that first you kind of want to go through the regulatory process the next couple months, see where that kind of falls out and then decide the timing on – and, well, we know the amount – but the timing of the equity, is that what you are saying?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think that's right. I mean, I'll let Bob add. But the point is, and I think you picked up on Andy. So this is a iterate process. We need to have the conversations with our regulators. They need to give us the signals on what's important to them, and I do think credit quality will be important to them. So, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're having I think good preliminary dialogues across the board in all of our eight states.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Bob, do you have any additional comment?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, I think Ben got it all.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Okay. And then just kind of sticking with that, so you get through your discussions and you figure things out, and then Bob mentioned it will be front-end loaded. The last time you did block equity or you did a larger chunk of equity that was not ESOP or DRIP, did you do an at-the-money or did you kind of just do a block or I don't remember?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I think the last equity issuance, and I'm looking around the room, the last equity issuance predated me, but I believe it was at-the-money issuance.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, it was.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: At-the-market issuance.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: And again, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth and I don't know what you're comfortable saying, but would that be a similar conduit that you would issue equity or could we possibly see a block at some point just to get it done?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think, Andy, I'll consider all opportunities to get it done effectively. But an at-the-market is probably the base case and we see what the alternatives look like.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. You think about it Andy, I mentioned that essentially tax reform adds $1.3 billion to our rate base, but that's even after – that's net of the reducing CapEx by $500 million. So it's not a lot of equity to support credit ratings and we are committed to credit ratings. But that's why at the end of the day even with modest amounts of equity, assuming we have constructive dialogues with the regulators, which I think we are having, this will be accretive to our earnings growth.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: No. I guess you're missing what I'm trying to get at. I mean, I think $300 million is not a relevant amount and obviously the story is more than intact if not getting better, which lead to my next question. But I'm just trying to get a sense of timing because that's kind of important too, whether it's just a block or at-the-money. Makes it just a little bit of difference as far as trading dynamics when we get to that point. So, that was what I was getting at. And then my other question, and I think it was asked earlier, but I wasn't clear on what I heard, that's my fault. So whether it's Colorado or some of the other initiatives you have out there that are pending on the regulatory side that we have not got final approval, you may have settlements in whatever it may be, but those would be incremental to the 5% to 6% growth rate? I'm not saying you'll grow more than 5% to 6%, but that those projects are not contemplated currently in that 5% to 6%. Is that correct or not?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, the only thing that's outside of our capital forecast is the Colorado Energy Plan.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Okay.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, that's the only capital that's outside of our – or things that are outside of our...
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: That's still pending regulatory wise?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That is correct.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital: Okay. Thank you. That's clear. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You bet.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: And with that ladies and gentleman, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore, Mr. Frenzel, I will turn the conference over to you for any closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, everyone, for participating in our earnings call this morning. And please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn our conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss earning guidance, update our financial plans and objectives and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter earnings of $0.97 per share compared to $0.90 per share last year. We are very pleased to report another solid quarter. With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we are narrowing our full year guidance range to $2.27 to $2.32 per share. We're also initiating 2018 earning guidance of $2.37 to $2.47 per share. We're also updating our five-year capital forecast. And as you know, we're making significant capital investments and renewables. So let me provide you an update of our Steel-for-Fuel investment strategy. In August in response to our resource plan, we filed a stipulation agreement to create the Colorado Energy Plan. The proposal is a bold step and the continuing transition of our generation portfolio and contemplates the early retirement of two coal units at our Comanche Plan and the addition of up to 1,000 megawatts wind, 700 megawatts of solar and 700 megawatts of natural gas and/or storage. As part of the agreement, we have an ownership target of 50% of the renewable additions and 75% on natural gas and storage investment which could lead to an incremental investment of up to 1.59 billion rather dollars. We believe this is a great opportunity for all stakeholders. Our Colorado business could achieve 55% renewable energy by 2026 and carbon emission reductions of 60% from 2005 levels. And we believe the plan can be implemented without cost increases to customers. We expect our commission decision by the summery of 2018. Continuing on the Steel-for-Fuel theme, in September, we proposed the Dakota Range project, which is a 300-megawatt wind farm that we are planning to build and own in South Dakota. This is the first announced wind project that will go into service in 2021. With total capital cost in the range of 1,200 to 1,200 a KW, this project is cost competitive even with the PTC at the 80% level. Improvement in wind technology and supply chain, are expected to continue and proves that wind can be economical beyond the PTC period. As with our other wind projects, there are significant cost savings to customers from the Dakota Range project. We've requested that the Minnesota commission approved the project by March 2018. Next, I'll provide a quick update on our SPS wind proposal. As you will recall, we have proposed to add 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind in two locations in Texas and New Mexico. In addition, we have proposed a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. Our proposal provides significant cost savings and environmental benefits which our customers will realize as soon as the wind farms go into operation. In October, interveners provided initial testimony and as expected, they push back on our cost recovery mechanisms. This project is a $1.6 billion investment and represents approximately 40% of SPS's rate base, because this is a substantial investment and stakeholders will rely immediate benefits and savings, we need some of current recovery to offset regulatory lag in order to forward these wind projects. This week, we filed our Rebuttal testimony in Texas and proposed some measures to address intervener concerns. We've had many meetings with our stakeholders and are cautiously optimistic, we can reach a settlement that works for everyone. We expect final decisions on this proposal by the end of firth quarter in 2018. As the company has progress on our clean energy transition and Steel-for-Fuel strategy, there's been a lot of investor focus on our long-term earnings growth target. After careful consideration of our plans, we have tightened our long-term EPS targets of 5% to 6% annual growth. I feel very confident, we can deliver EPS growth within this range based up on our current plans. And of course as always, we are focused on delivering earnings at the top end of that range. With that let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Robert Frenzel: Thanks Ben, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter with earnings of $0.97 per share compared with $0.90 per share last year. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include higher electric margin which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recovery our capital investments, offset by production tax credits that flew back to our customers. Lower O&M expenses largely due to timing increased earnings by $0.06 per share. And finally, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.07 per share. The lower effective tax rate reflects increased wind product tax credits, the resolution of tax appeals and an increase in research and experimentation credits. Keep in mind the PTCs will back to the customers through base rates, riders of the fuel cost don't have a material impact on net income. Offsetting these positive drivers where increase depreciation expense reflecting our capital investment program which reduced earnings by $0.05. Higher taxes other than income primarily property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and higher conservation and DSM expenses which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. Those expenses are offset by higher corresponding revenues. Turning to sales, on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales improved 0.2%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across those customer class and jurisdictions offset by lower use per customers. Natural gas sales increased 1.8% year-to-date on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, reflecting continued customer growth, partially offset by a decline in use per customer. Our year-to-date electric sales are growing consistent with our annual growth forecast of 0% to 0.5%, while our natural gas sales growing a little bit better than expected. We continue to focus on our O&M expenses. Quarter-over-quarter, O&M cost declined $49 million, while year-to-date, O&M expense were $58 million. The quarter and year-to-date O&M underrun largely reflects the timing of plan outages and transmission and distribution line maintenance. We expect most of the year-to-date underrun to reverse in the fourth quarter, in addition, we expect incremental pension and benefit costs in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we expect annual O&M to be consistent with 2016 with some potential favorability. This would be the fourth consecutive year of near flat O&M expenses. Next, I'll provide a regulatory update. Please note that there are additional details on each cash included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we have pending request to increase electric rates by $25 million and natural rates by $12 million. Gas and intervener testimony since submitted and hearings that's included. We anticipate a commission decision in December and final rates to be effective in January of 2018. In Texas, we have a pending electric case, seeking a net increase of $55 million. We anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of 2018 with final rates to be implemented retroactively to January of 2018. And in Colorado, we filed a multiyear natural gas case seeking a $139 million increase over three years. NM rates will be implemented in January and final rates expected to be effective in March of 2018. We also recently filed a multiyear electric case in Colorado seeking $245 million increase over four years. Final rates are expected to be effective in June of 2018. In addition, we are also planning to file a New Mexico electric case later this week. Turning to earnings guidance based on our year-to-date results were narrowing our full year 2017 earnings guidance range $2.27 to $2.32 per share. Our previously guidance range was $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And while our year-to-date earnings are $0.12 per share ahead of last year. Keep in mind that we expect our year-to-date O&M underrun to largely reverse in the fourth quarter. We also initiating our 2018 earnings guidance range of $2.37 to $2.47 per share, which is consistent with our revise long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 6% annually. Please note that our 2018 EPS guidance is based on several assumptions which are listed in the earnings release. I want to highlight a couple of them here. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We expect modest electric sales growth of 0% to 0.5% per year. And finally, we expect O&M expenses to remain flat, but we work to continue improve efficiency and drive costs out of the business. In our earnings release you will find our updated five-year capital forecast which reflects investment of $19 billion in our base capital plan and drives annual rate base growth of 5.5%. Our base capital plan includes the SPS wind proposal and the Dakota Range project. Our base capital forecast does not include any potential investments for the recently proposed Colorado Energy plan which result an incremental capital investment of up to $1.5 billion. This incremental capital investment would result in approximately 6.3% annual rate base growth through 2022. We've also updated our financing plan. In addition to reinvesting our cash flow back into infrastructure and our operating companies, operating company and holding company there to fund our capital plan. And for the past several years, we've used market purchases for our benefits programs, however going forward, we expect issue approximately $75 million to $80 million of DRIP and benefits equity per year. This will allow us to maintain our solid credit metrics with an expanded capital investment program. Additional details are included in our earnings release. And finally tax performance back in the news. In September where public and leadership and the administration release the high-level framework that would service a template for legislation that we expect to be released in draft form next week. There is a lot of uncertainly on the potential outcome given the complicated nature of comprehensive tax reform. But our position on tax reform hasn't changed. We believe a lower corporate tax rate is good for the economy, our customers, Xcel Energy and the utilities sector. And we believe the preservation of interest deductibility and bonus depreciation are expensing a capital is in the best interest of our customers. And finally we believe the transition rules are important to the implementation and we work within to ensure any new legislation and regulation is implemented in a matter that best protect for customer interest. While any final legislation could take many forms, we are confident that we can manage the impacts of potential tax reform and deliver on our earnings and dividend growth objectives. With that I'll ramp up overall with an excellent quarter, we filed our proposed Colorado Energy plan which approved, we continue our clean energy transition and add substantial renewable generation and significantly reduce submissions with no incremental costs to our customers. We proposed the Dakota Range project which represents the first wind project plan for 2021 and it is cost competitive and results in customer savings even with the phase down of the production tax credits. We progressed our regulatory initiatives and are engaged in rate proceedings in Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and soon to be New Mexico. We provided updated capital plans that provide transparency and support our 5% to 6% earnings and 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. And finally we posted strong financial results for the quarter and are well positioned to deliver earnings within our narrowed guidance range of $2.27, $2.32 per share. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take some questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Hey, good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Good morning, Julien and welcome back.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Perhaps just first quick question. You never stop asking for more expose but congrats on moving the guidance range up but suppose the first question I love to hear you and spell out the plan little bit more detail is on the upside case of the Colorado, just the timing of the capital there and ultimately the regulatory recovery scheme and how you are thinking about that phase again, basically at what points in time will you be filing and what point in time do you expect to actually see that capital play out and what point would you eventually get comfortable put that another plan?
Benjamin Fowke: Okay, well, here is where we are, Julien. We have request for proposals out. We expect to get those proposals in and be in a position to make a recommendation to the commission in the first quarter of next year. We are hopeful for a favorable decision in the summer of 2018. As far as timing goes, I think a lot of that will depend upon the proposals themselves and what comes in and what makes sense. So you know you are probably starting so I mean could just ask the native for you probably in the 2021, 2022 timeframe, but how that would lay in, I think we got to see what is presented to us and then we have better handle on that.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Got it. Alright, fair enough. And then turning back to Texas, New Mexico just recovery there, the plan et cetera, can you talk about perhaps at a high level how you are thinking about moving forward to those projects and ultimately, I'll leave it as high level as asking expectations and earned through the construction project and what sort of palatable to you all in both those jurisdictions?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, if you saw our Rebuttal testimony that we've filed in Texas, you see that - I think we've addressed the intervener concerns and you know are willing to do reasonable symmetrical cost gaps, reasonable performance guarantees, certainly if we get a decision when we want the decision, we can make sure that the PTs will be eligible for the PTCs, in this case a 100%. And I think we're - our revised idea for recovery is one that I think makes all the sense in the world that before they go into rate base but rather an operation, we'll enjoy the PTC and any market sales of the project that included benefit of our shareholders. So if you put all that together, then that would be the kind of return that we would need to be able to move forward.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Got it. So you think kind of consistent level of earn return in that jurisdiction still?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, we want to see the returns get better.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Okay. So you think it's possible maybe just in light of what you're proposing in Rebuttal et cetera to be improving ROE and see that capital deployment happen said differently?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, the short answer is yeah. This is 40% of the SPS rate base and we'd get better recovery of investments than we typically get now which as you know in historic test your mode even in New Mexico where there's a forward test year but to date the commission has found a way to throw those type those cases out.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Excellent. Well, best of luck and congratulations.
Benjamin Fowke: Thanks. Good to have you back.
Julien Dumoulin Smith: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Good morning.
Ali Agha: If the Colorado project does get approved and you add the 1.5 billion CapEx to you plan, what does that do to the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, let's start with rate base, it would take rate base up to from 5.5% to about 6.3%. So that clearly gives and that is as the engine for EPS growth rate. So 6.3% is at the top end of the 5% to 6%.
Ali Agha: Okay. But would you assume more equity in the mix to kind of the dilute some of that rate base falling all the way to EPS growth?
Benjamin Fowke: I think there's a lot of variables that go into that Ali, I mean right now, we're comfortable with the DRIP program and again as I mentioned to - July on the prior call, I think it has to do with - we would have to look at the timing of when that those capital expenditures would take place.
Ali Agha: Okay. Also within your base plan Ben, then what have you assumed in terms of the trend line in your earned ROE, have you assumed significant pick up or just remind us what's the lag and what do you assume happens to the lag over that four, five-year period?
Robert Frenzel: Hey, Ali. It's Bob. You know look, when we look at a regulated ROEs and where we've been on objective is to close ROE gap. I think we've done a reasonable amount of progress in that regard. But as the headline allowed to come down slightly, I think where we are year-to-date where we expect to be for the forecast period is somewhere in that high eights range of earned ROEs in the regulated operating companies.
Ali Agha: Okay. So Bob in other words, you're assuming your earned ROEs remain relatively steady or flattish over this period?
Robert Frenzel: That's correct.
Ali Agha: I see. Okay. And then lastly looking at load growth just for the third quarter, we did see a decline in weather normalized electric sales, you have been trending fairly, nicely and positively through the first half. Anything to read into that is that have any implication as you're looking at load growth going forward?
Robert Frenzel: I wouldn't read too much into that it's more of a function, we had a pretty solid Q3 last year and so relative comparison in Q3 over Q3 looks a little bit down. Through the full year, we're still slightly up and within our guidance range. And if you look at the trend over a multi-year period, we're still very much in line with our expectations. So Q3 of 2016 was probably a stronger quarter and the relative comparison is down.
Ali Agha: I see. Thank you
Robert Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller: Good morning. I was wondering on the Colorado, we stay with Colorado here for a second. Is there any kind of overlap between the multiyear especially when you go out to 2020 and 2021 and the energy plan?
Benjamin Fowke: Is there any kind of overlap...?
Travis Miller: Just in terms of infrastructure build or anything that would be necessary to support that energy plan?
Benjamin Fowke: I don't know if there's really an overlap, I don't know if you're referring to recovery. We do have David Eves here that runs our Colorado operations. So David, if there is any additional detail, you could?
David Eves: Yeah. The electric rate case that we filed four your plan through 2021 doesn't include any projections or cost recovery for the Colorado energy plan. Those would be recovered under the recovery mechanisms we proposed in a plan like through the ECA.
Travis Miller: Okay. Okay. And then quick dividend question?
David Eves: I don't mind then that you get proposing concurrent recovery.
Travis Miller: Okay, for the energy plan?
David Eves: Yes.
Travis Miller: Yeah. Okay. And then a quick dividend question. I think where we recall, you had said that 60% to 70% payout target for the next couple of years and I was wondering how that might be affected with any of the incremental investment that you might get in particularly the Colorado investment?
David Eves: You know Travis, we haven't changed our guidance on either dividend growth or dividend payout expectations with regard to the base case forecast or with regard to the Colorado energy plan.
Travis Miller: Okay. So you still think you could potentially go up to that 70% is still the 60% to 70% range?
Benjamin Fowke: I mean I think if we grow our earnings at where we think they are along with the projected dividend thing that's going to - it would take a long time for kick at the 70%. But stepping back Travis and I think you've heard me say this before, the modest payout ratio that we have I think gives as that dry powder and the event you start to see rates rise. We can do more to reward our shareholders by rethinking the pace of our dividend increases. I'm not saying we're going to do that, but it's kind of all part of our plan to make sure that we don't - we always have dry powder whether it's on the operational side, the financial side, dividend projections. so that we can continue to reward shareholders on a number of different scenarios.
Travis Miller: Okay Great. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Stephen. Good morning.
Stephen Byrd: Wanted to talk about your Colorado energy plan and you mentioned the potential for either gas or storage. When you think about the economics of gas generation relative to storage, what is your sense of the trend the likelihood that over time storage will become so cheap that it's likely to become more advantageous as a resource relative to gas by generation, what's your sense for where you might end up there?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I tell you what when you look at what we're doing now with renewables and our Steel-for-Fuel and the price point that they're coming in at, those prices there's no way I would have ever thought it would be possible eight years ago. So I never short change what technology can do. Right now though Stephen, it is batteries and are relatively low-cost jurisdictions don't compete economically, there might be some opportunities in some areas deploy then, but I think it's important to recognize that they're going to continue to fall in price. You know will they ever be the new peaker? I think there's going to be system grid reliability limitations on how much of that could happen. And from a planning capacity, there are differences between a battery and something that is can be fired up 24/7 for days at a time. But you can see more batteries on our system, that's the bottom line and will be positioned to make sure that becomes increasingly more of a mainstream part of our portfolio, while at the technology move at the speed of the value. And in the meantime, we'll do things like we are doing which is pilot programs et cetera to really understand all the various economics, the grid capabilities and reliability, batteries bring to the table. So long winded answer to your question, we'll see what the resource plan brings to us and then we'll made the right economic decisions for our customers.
Stephen Byrd: That's very, very helpful color. And just longer term we been having great success with the growth of renewable. Is there a point at which storage needs to start or gas or both become sort of incrementally you much more significant or do you think it's fairly linear, in other words do you reach a point where you get such a degree of renewals that you have to significantly step up a gas for generation and/or storage or do you think it's more just sort of a steady progression that we'll see?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I think what we're going to do is we are we're going to have more renewables on our system I believe than anybody else in this timeframe, certainly more wind. And so you do have load following resources and I think that's what you mean by the gas technology. I think that's where batteries can play a role. I think it also requires you to start rethinking about your demand response programs et cetera making sure that you can shift load to a degree. Where the practical limitations on renewable and on the system and I can tell you I'm working with our operational people and learning all about system and things like that because I mean at some point as you know you can't - with today's technology, you cannot truly be one 100% renewable within your own grid. You always have to have another place to move and excess power and bring in power when you need it, but you can get really, really close. And I think if you look at what we're talking about in our vision case and in Minnesota what we're talking about in Colorado, I don't think anybody would have thought these things would have been practical five, ten years ago and certainly not out of the price point that doesn't raise costs for customers. Did I answer your question?
Stephen Byrd: Yeah, it does. I mean I guess I'm thinking about longer term, it sounds like you're doing a lot of assessment in terms of how your grid is going to change and thinking about items like inertia which are way beyond my capability understand but it sounds like stay tuned but it - my sense it sounds like storage and load volumes, it's going to be an important part of that equation?
Benjamin Fowke: All of the above is going to be important.
Stephen Byrd: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Christopher.
Christopher Turnure: Good morning. If I remember correctly last year when you started to have success on the Minnesota renewable front then you were kind of discussing the impact on your overall rate base growth and CapEx plan, you deferred some other spending at least hypothetically to limit the positive impact there. If I kind of reverse the situation now and say you have 5.5% rate base growth to the plan, let's say you are not successful with any of the on approval renewable projects, you might get down below 5%. Are there other things that you can pull forward that are on the back burner right now that would bring you up to a slightly more competitive rate base growth well?
Benjamin Fowke: The short answer is yes. We could - I think when I made those comments that you referred to, it's really about how much great investment you do and while those great investments are credibly beneficial to our customers that does come with a price tag, so we want to be very mindful of that. But we have other capital we could bring forward or other opportunities that we could seek, I mean look at the deal - the Dakota Range budget as an example of that. So I have no doubt that we will need our rate base growth projections.
Christopher Turnure: Okay.
Robert Frenzel: Keep in mind the base case does not include the Colorado energy plan which is $1.5 billion, so that could very easily move into base which would potentially offset any departures of other capital.
Christopher Turnure: Sure. Yes certainly there are plenty of ways to do in here. And then switching gears to the Colorado gas case, I think this has been one area where lag has been a bit more pronounced if I'm not mistaken. Could you maybe help us understand how the staff recommendation as it pertains to forward looking rate making and maybe the multi-year angle or lack thereof dove tails with the commissions kind of investigation of that is as ordered back in June and I think maybe they ordered the ALJ to look into the further potential for forward looking in multi-year rates?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, I'm going to turn it over to David Eves again, but I think the success we've had with our multi-year plans on the electric case gives me a lot of optimism that we can do the same on the gas side. Particularly when you look at where that - what those investments are which is making sure that our gas system is reliable and safe.
David Eves: Christopher, this is David. The commissioners when they referred this to an administrative law judge made it pretty clear that they wanted a policy and full consideration of future test years in a multi-year plan. We're disappointed that the staff even though OCC addressed it somewhat the staff really sidestep the issue and did not address the future test years in the multi-year plan. We still think we have a really good case and we'll address that in our rebuttal coming on November 3rd.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. But it's not like you're confident in the commission and there kind of just in general the direction that they're going in despite what just asset?
David Eves: Yeah, I think we're confident. I think we have - we feel like we have a really strong case and you'll see that with our rebuttal. It's also the gas revenue requirement is really a capital driven. We're investing very significantly and the basic system but also in all the integrity work and part of this plan is to replace the PSIA with for a test year multi-year plan. So I think it's set up well.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.
Benjamin Fowke: Good morning.
Jonathan Arnold: Question on the, so you put the DRIP in the plan now, I see the financing plan which was not before, presumably that's probably the function of higher CapEx, but did you make a specific tax reform assumption in there? That was one question. And then secondly, should we - when should we assume switched on, is it later in the plan or is it more linear?
Robert Frenzel: Yeah, Jon, it's Bob. I don't think we made any direct consideration on tax reform with respect to turning on the DRIP. If you remember the share repurchase program was initiated when the capital environment was you know 4ish billion dollars less than it is today. So with consideration for credit and everything else, I think we wanted to make sure that we had a very conservative plan that maintained our credit rating and a modest amount of DRIP equity annually was enough in our opinion to maintain that profile. When you ask about when do you turn it back off, I think it just depends on what the future capital profile and opportunities for investment for the company. We see a long runway for capital investment at this rate and so at this point, we would consider keeping it on including…
Jonathan Arnold: Actually, Bob, my question was when do you turn it on, do you turn it on like in 2018 or is it more the back end of the plan?
Robert Frenzel: Sorry, we expect turn it on in 2018.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And then so then by extension if you do incremental CapEx that's outside of the current plan, is it reasonable to assume, you'd address that through stepping up DRIP. Could you do more, or might you look for another type of equity?
Robert Frenzel: Yeah, I think as Ben mentioned earlier on the call, we think that even with the Colorado Energy Plan we think DRIP would be sufficient equity for our financing plan for the five-year period.
Jonathan Arnold: Yeah, okay.
Robert Frenzel: It depends Jonathan on the timing of when that CapEx would come through.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. And but this level of DRIP, this is presumably not what you could have raised, you could do more than that under DRIP on gas?
Robert Frenzel: No, because DRIP is - I mean DRIP is, when we say DRIP, we're talking about dividend reinvestment plan, so that's going to be what it is and our benefit plan as well and so it's not really. I mean it's that $75 million, $80 million kind of equity issuance every year.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. All right, great. Thank you. And then could I just on the sort of revised proposals and but I may have missed this, I apologize if I am going over something you covered but what's your level of confidence that what you put on the table in Texas now for the SPS wind project is kind of going to tick the boxes you need to take and then you can stay on time?
Robert Frenzel: I think it's - first of all Jonathan, you were very quick to summarize that Rebuttal testimony. SoI enjoyed your report. But I think it's - I mean I think it's very responsive to the concerns while still recognizing that we need to have better recovery for this level of investment particularly when you look at the compelling customer benefits to come along with it.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. Can I ask just sort of one sort of point in detail on that, when you guarantee the 100% PTC, is that in the sense of in case the projects delayed beyond the deadline to get the full PTC or is that more around this deferred tax issue and the fact that you want customers to get the full benefit even if you're not able to fully realize it on a current basis?
Robert Frenzel: No. it has to do with getting it in service in time to make sure it qualifies for the 100% PTC eligibility. Now, we do ask in a testimony as you know that our willingness to do that is based upon a commission decision I believe in March of 2018, which would allow the time we need to actually get it constructed.
Jonathan Arnold: Okay. Great thank you, Bob.
Robert Frenzel: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski: Thank you. So just looking at you know Midwestern utilities pushing more renewables in the rate base, I mean I understand the energy aspect of the appeal of these investment, but we're starting to see first indications that intervene want some offset to the existing generation capacity because these assets do have some megawatts as well as the energy component. And so I mean how likely is it that we could see some betterment to the rate base growth because you would be forced for incidence either write down our shutdown some and appreciate coal plant or gas plants that currently existing of rate base along with the additions of new wind farms?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I can't speak for all of the Midwest utilities but speaking for itself, I think we've done a very good job of developing comprehensive plans that when we do talk about shutting down plants and for example in Minnesota, one and two units that we get the recovery associated with that shutdown. And in fact Angie if you look at what we're talking about in Colorado, we contemplate accelerating the depreciation of the Comanche one and two plants through a what's known as the reason mechanism, so that is taken care of and the cost of all of that and both of those plans still comes in at a price that's great for consumers. So we definitely look at that risk and we address it in the plans that we put forward to our stakeholders.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. My second question, so assuming the tax reform that's happened and the CapEx deductions are extended, would you consider using a tax equity investors to monetize the PTC's especially under the scenario where you in a way share this benefit up front and then the cash true up of that benefit from your perspective it would be delayed if the in-effect bonus depreciation would be extended?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I mean I think you'd have to see what sort of scenarios roll out, but I think one of the scenario that I think been pretty successful advocating for, I don't think we'd have the need to do that. You got to keep in mind Angie that this the way I look at these wind proposals as a deeply, deeply in the money hedge against gas prices. So there's room for these projects to get essential a little more expensive on the different tax reform scenarios and still bid deeply in the money. We have a great cost of capital and tax equity as you probably know is very, very expensive. So and of course under those scenarios, you mention it probably would get more expensive. So I think putting in rate base and delivering the kind of level cost of energy to our customers that we anticipate is the right path forward.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. And last question. So the rebuttal testimony in support of those wind investments for SPS, okay so the way I understood it is that you're basically trying to shield the earning during this say 18-month periods between when the asset would start operations and we could actually get the rates. But how would that help you increase of realize ROE I mean that's very, but I mean to me it just seems more like you're basically trying not to have a detrimental to the ROE as opposed an improvement?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I mean you're trying to - I think it depends on how the market conditions would unfold but you're talking about a proposal when it - by the time it's operational in between operation and in service because we are in historic tax year and taxes that we would enjoy the production tax credits in any market sales, that's what you're talking about?
Angie Storozynski: Yes, yeah.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, well I think there's some variability in that based on the market sales, but the PTCs would be fairly compelling. And again I like a rider a forward rider, but we're also wanting to see these projects get done, they're great for our customers and the mechanism that we talked about while not our first choice is something we can live with and not see lag associate with those particular projects.
Angie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Paul.
Paul Ridzon: Good morning. If maybe you answered this and I didn't pick it up, but if the Colorado Energy Plan were approved, would that $1.5 billion kind of push other projects off the stack or delay them or could you fully absorb that along with all the other projects?
Robert Frenzel: Hey, Paul. It's Bob. Our expectation is that when depends a lot on the timing of the proposal that we receive in the recommendations we make to the committee, but I think our proposal would be that we would keep the Colorado Energy Plan as incremental to our base capital plan. And we look at any changes year-over-year that might be necessary, but the bottom line is assuming it comes in and when we think it would which is 2020, 2021, 2022 that we'd be able to manage that capital profile.
Paul Ridzon: That was you said 2020, 2021, 2022, is there a comma between the three numbers are that 2020, 2021 and 2022?
Robert Frenzel: Sorry 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Paul Ridzon: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: Good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Hey Paul.
Paul Patterson: Just to make sure on the CapEx and rate base numbers, does that include all of the SPS wind CapEx and if the Mexico for incidence doesn't happen or what have you, you have to have both in Mexico and Texas for those for the SPS when proposals happen?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, Paul, we proposed two projects, one in New Mexico, one in Texas, but we run the system on an integrated basis and our approval process would look to go to both Texas and the Mexico for approvals for both projects.
Robert Frenzel: So Paul, you are asking in the $19 billion, what's included in the base is the assumption that our proposals that SPS go through, so that's in the base, but as we mention what's not in the base is the Colorado Energy Plan.
Paul Patterson: Right. Okay. But just if the full amount of the SPS wind in the base, right?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes, including and also in Minnesota the upper Midwest rather the Dakota Range project.
Paul Patterson: Right. And then just what I was asking, I apologize if it wasn't clear. Is it - there was a problem in New Mexico or something is that, would that basically - with that impact - how would that impact the SPS wind project, do you follow what I am saying, do you need both of them in order for them?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, I mean I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it but the ideal you get approval from both as Bob's point, we run the system on an integrated basis. But there have been times where we have allocated a project specifically to a jurisdiction. It can be done, it's not ideal but it can be done.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Okay, that's it. All other questions been answered. Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to turn it back to Bob Frenzel for any additional remarks.
Robert Frenzel: Thanks everyone for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing in Orlando.
Operator: And that does conclude conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2017 second quarter results, and also update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid earnings for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Bob will provide more detail in a regulatory update. That said, we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance and remain committed to our long-term outlook. We've made significant progress on our Steel for Fuel initiative this quarter, and are executing on our plan to add almost 3,400 megawatts of new wind to our systems by the end of 2020. Earlier this month, the Minnesota Commission approved our wind proposal to add 1,550 megawatts of new wind generation, which includes 400 megawatts of power purchase agreements, and 1,150 megawatts of new rate-based wind, more than doubling our wind ownership. All projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2020, and will qualify for 100% of the PTC tax benefit. Our Texas, New Mexico proposal to add 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind, and 230 megawatts of Power Purchase Agreements is currently in regulatory review. The proposal has received strong community support, reflecting a significant customer savings and environmental benefits. We expect final decision by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Finally, our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind project in Colorado is under construction, progressing as planned, and is expected to go into service on time in late 2018. Earlier this month, Colorado Governor, Hickenlooper issued an executive order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and join other states that have signed onto the U.S. Climate Alliance. We are working with stakeholders to develop and advance the plan that will help Colorado achieve the Governor's goals. We will keep you posted on potential developments. Our Steel for Fuel strategy is about making investments that produce significant savings to our customers, which more than offset the capital costs. Another example of this strategy is our recent proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota to terminate four Power Purchase Agreements. This includes the termination of Fibrominn, Laurentian and Pine Bend PPAs. If approved, these actions would result in capital investment of about $100 million, and provide about $650 million in net cost savings to our customers over the next 10 years. We expect that Minnesota and North Dakota Commissions will review and decide on this valuable customer program before the end of 2017. Providing our customers with reliable energy supply continues to be a company priority and our efforts were once again recognized by the Edison Electric Institute. Last month, EEI presented us with the Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding restoration efforts after Texas winter storm Jupiter in January. This was the third consecutive year Xcel Energy has received this award. I'm proud of the men and women that deliver for our customers every day on behalf of Xcel Energy. Our employees continually rise to the occasion to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy, frequently under tough conditions with adverse weather and during the holidays when they would prefer to be home with our families. Finally, at Xcel Energy, we're constantly working to integrate new technologies into our operations to enhance public and worker safety, improve efficiency and generate additional savings. A really good example is our recent utilization of drones. We're pioneering the use of drones to inspect project sites, transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, power plant boilers, wind farms and storm damage assessment. We're breaking new ground and have received preliminary approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond the line of sight, and this is just another example of striving to deliver on operational excellence. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update. Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. We realized another solid quarter of earnings of $0.45 per share in 2017, compared with $0.39 per share in 2016. The most significant earnings drivers for the quarter include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.07 per share, largely due to the impact of rate increases in non-fuel riders to cover our capital investments, lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, the lower effective tax rate was mainly due to wind production tax credits which flow back to our customers through a rider or a fuel clause, and lower O&M expenses which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Offsetting these positive drivers was increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per share. Turning to sales, on a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our year-to-date electric sales improved 0.8%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across most customer classes and jurisdictions, offset by lower use per customer. Natural gas sales increased 1.7% year-to-date on a weather and leap year adjusted basis with a similar story, continued growth in the number of customers, partially offset by a decline in use per customer. While it's too early to call this a trend, it's nice to see that both year-to-date electric and natural gas sales are growing a bit better than expected. We continue to make progress on managing our costs. Quarter-over-quarter, O&M expenses were $19 million lower, largely driven by timing of planned maintenance at our power plants. On a year-to-date basis, our O&M expense is $10 million lower. We're focused on keeping our cost low, and are on track to deliver flat O&M expenses for the full year. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update as we've made significant progress during the quarter and continued to execute on our plan. In the second quarter, the Minnesota Commission approved our multi-year electric rate case settlement agreement without modification. This multi-year plan covers 2016 through 2019, and provides the company and customers with revenue and price certainty. It also includes an annual sales true up, and continued use of all existing riders. In Colorado, the commission approved our advanced grid proposal and a decoupling mechanism with some modifications. First, the commission approved our advanced grid settlement. The project includes installing advanced metering infrastructure and communication networks, which will enhance grid reliability, improve the customer experience and enable new programs and rate structures. The settlement spreads the capital investment over a longer timeframe than originally proposed, deferring about $120 million of capital investment beyond our forecast. Second, the commission approved total class revenue decoupling for residential and small commercial customers. The decoupling adjustment will be based on actual sales, which eliminates the impact of weather. The commission modified our decoupling proposal and plan to file for reconsideration of the decision to calculate the decoupling based on class revenue rather than revenue per customer. We also filed rate cases in Wisconsin and Colorado. In Wisconsin, we filed to increase electric rates by $25 million and natural gas rates by $12 million. The filing is based on a 2018 forward test year, a 10% ROE and a 52.5% equity ratio. We anticipate a commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates to be effective January of 2018. In Colorado, we filed a multi-year natural gas case seeking new revenues of $139 million over three years. The filing is based on a series of forward test years, an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55%. We expect a commission decision and implementation of final rates in February of 2018. We're also planning to file electric cases in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico over the next several months. With that, I'll wrap up. Overall, it was an excellent quarter. We received regulatory approvals for a multi-year electric case in our wind proposals in Minnesota. In Colorado, the commission approved a decoupling mechanism in our advanced grid settlement. We filed proposals with the Minnesota and North Dakota commissions for termination or modification of higher cost PPAs, which will provide significant reductions to customer bills. Finally, we posted strong financial results for the quarter, and are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: And we'll go first to Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning Ali.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Ben our Bob, when we go back, your original base CapEx plans 2017 through 2021 was $18.4 billion. So when you look at some of the projects on the wind side that have been approved, you had mentioned some delay or a push out, I should say, on the AMI in Colorado. Net-net, what is that $18.4 billion looking like right now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, Ali, we haven't updated our capital guidance based on the updated wind and the effects of AEGIS and other capital impacts. And we expect to do that in normal course as we usually do in the third quarter. (11:28) a few moving parts. I mean, so as said last quarter, you can't expect it to go up the full amount of what's been approved, and we've obviously added the biomass opportunity in there, but there's some moving parts, and as Bob said, we'll have a full updated CapEx forecast third quarter.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And if I just recall from previous disclosures, the incremental new wind projects, if all of them get approved, if I remember correctly, was roughly about $700 million, does that sound right?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And of that, Bob, just to be clear, the ones that you have gotten approved for Minnesota, how much of that $700 million is now officially blessed by the regulators?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, I think that the approval of our 400 megawatts of build-own-transfer wind projects in Minnesota would realize all that $700 million.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. So that's all done. And if I heard you right, Bob, you also said, in Colorado, there's about $120 million that has been pushed in outer years on the AMI spend.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So those are two distinct data points that are incremental. Among the other numbers you were mentioning, at least among those, is there anything else incremental to keep an eye on from our perspective?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, nothing discreet at this point, Ali. We're just working through the normal process of updating all of our capital plans for all of our operating companies.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, we're also waiting for approval of the SPS 1,000 megawatts, which is approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion of CapEx.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right, so that's not in there yet. Got it. Second question, the 12-month earned operating ROE, I believe was 8.98%. If my math is right, that reflects roughly about a 60-basis point lag versus authorized. Does that sound about right?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, how many points did you say?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 60?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, that's right.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And Bob, is the goal, I mean, given frictional timing issues, et cetera, what's the sort of the theoretical maximum you can push that? Are we pretty close to that right now?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Ali, we've been committed to trying to close the lag in our earn to actual ROEs. We first started talking about this, I think our consolidated allowed was closer to 9.8% and we were earning closer to 8.9%. So we've obviously brought the bottom end of that number up. The top end has come down slightly, our weighted average authorized is closer to 9.6% now. I think in our first quarter call, we provided guidance that we were looking to be in or around where we were last year, and we hope to close that gap sometime in 2018.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And last question, as you look at these CapEx spending opportunities, and I know you'll scrub it all out and give it to us in Q3, but clearly, the bias is towards more spending in renewable. There seems to be support for that, the wind project, et cetera, you talked about in SPS. So when you put it all together, are you still looking at a 4% to 6% EPS CAGR? Is there some shared issuance dilution that keeps you there, or should we assume that as CapEx is going up mathematically, if shares are not going up, that should cause EPS CAGR to go up as well?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Ali, this is Ben. We are certainly pleased that we got the approval in Minnesota. We continue to look for opportunities to add new wind. I think the Minnesota Commission is comfortable, if we can bring them good projects to even do more. Still going to get the approval down at SPS. It's a big part of that CapEx upside. So all those things happen, I think we're pushing towards the upper end of our range, and we don't have to issue equity. I think that's important to note. I mean, there's some debt that goes with that, but we don't have to issue equity. So I think we're well-positioned to be at the top of that 4% to 6% guidance range, particularly for this forecast period, but we haven't changed the long-term growth rate at this point.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the SPS wind project approvals. I think in the past, you'd stated that you were hoping to get approval by year-end in both New Mexico – in Texas. And at the very least, you could get recovery of those projects through a general rate case filing, but you would also consider asking for some kind of rider mechanism to get them. Could you just kind of walk us through the specifics of upfront, what you need to hear from both commissions before you greenlight the projects, and when you expect that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, sure, we can do that. Let me just say, I think, it's going to be more like the first quarter of 2018 for the final approval. We're on the ground, getting a lot of community support, legislative support. I think these projects are very popular for their obvious economic benefits. So this is about a $1.6 billion spend. I believe that increases our rate base and SPS by about 40%. As we know, we've suffered from some pretty significant lag at SPS. So our proposal is that we need concurrent recovery. The benefits are going to flow immediately to our customers. They're going to be significant. We need to get immediate recovery. And I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll get that, and we're going to need to get that. I mean, this is too big of an investment to put into place and suffer the historic lag we typically have. So that's what it's all about and that's what we're working on right now.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then your conversation so far with the various stakeholders, commissioners, and other interveners, are leading you to positive conclusion so far?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, we haven't heard anything that would suggest that we can't work through a settlement, and that would be the ideal outcome. But these things take time.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then I was pleased to see the announcement of the PPA buyouts today. Relatively small numbers overall in the scheme of things, but certainly attractive opportunity going forward. Are there more of these, what's the magnitude and could you maybe give us a little bit of color on the counter parties there, and maybe why in your opinion they were willing to take upfront cash in exchange for a stream of cash flows over time that they would have otherwise gotten through the PPA?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, let me just first step back and say, I'm really excited about this. It's not a big capital investment for us, but $650 million of net cost savings, that's pretty significant to our customers. And I think if these all are proved, even after the cost to buy out the projects and all the other things you have to do to get the deals done, I think you're looking at about a 3% rate decrease for our customers, and that's great, and that's consistent with what we're trying to do, is continue to reduce carbon emissions while keeping rates flat and improving the customer experience. I think that's the right mix, and that's the right approach and this is more evidence we can get it done. How many more opportunities are out there? I think that remains to be seen. I don't think there's a ton, to be honest with you, but we're going to continue to look for anything we can do that helps save customers' money and provides us an investment opportunity at the same time. I would say that, what's the rationale for the counterparties to do this, I would look at the Fibrominn plant, which is the largest of the three projects, I mentioned. This was a project that had emerged from bankruptcy. It's always been a project where it's very expensive to the customer, but I think razor thin margins if not worse for the counterparties. So I mean, it's an economic proposition from their end when they do their NPVs and discounted cash flows, and it's obviously positive for our customer. So it's a real win-win for everybody.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Chris, it's Bob. As Ben said, the reason and the rationale for the counterparties is really that the benefit to the customers is the fuel cost. The owners of the assets aren't making significant margins on the assets. The benefit to the customer is to get rid of a significantly high fuel cost that is relatively a pass-through to the other side's owners.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And do you recall the original motivation of the PPA signing from your perspective, or was it part of PRPA or was it something else, RPS, et cetera?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Chris, do you want to take that one? This one dates back quite a ways.
Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Sure. This is Chris Clark, President of NSP-Minnesota. This dates back to the 1994 legislative proposals in Minnesota that allowed us to store spent fuel at our nuclear facility, and required us to enter into 125 megawatts of biomass power purchase agreements. That was later revised to 110 megawatts. So this has quite a history.
Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Very interesting. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Paul. Good morning.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: The SPS turbines, are they qualified for 100% PTC?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, 100%.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And that's a big chunk of intermittent capacity to drop in the market. Does the existing fleet have the ramping ability to follow that, or is there a follow on opportunity around rapid ramping gas plants?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We believe we can integrate that into our existing system with the existing portfolio of resources. I mean, this is – and obviously when you pencil it out versus firing up gas and coal facilities, it makes economic sense. So we have looked at that very closely, Paul, and believe it works.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And the $1.6 billion, how is that apportioned between the different jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The plants, the wind farms, there's two wind farms, one is 478 megawatts, one is 522 megawatts. You should consider the total capital dollars being split roughly on that ratio.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think what you're talking about what jurisdictions, Paul. Is that what you mean, percentage?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Let me – give me some help here. I think Texas is about what, 60%?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Texas is about 50%, SPS or New Mexico is about 20%, wholesale is about 30%.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So that's how it will be allocated.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then, New Mexico can be troublesome, my words, not yours. How are the discussions there going?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, again, I think the stakeholder outreach has been incredibly supportive. And that's I think going to be helpful, Paul, as we try to get the concurrent recovery that we need to do this great economic benefit for our customers. We all have to – shareholders have to participate in it too. So again, as I said previously, I'm cautiously optimistic we'll get this over the finish line with the kind of recovery we need to make it successful for all stakeholders.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And if you get to that point, do we need to reshuffle the capital deck and push more projects out, or I mean, I think you have tremendous support for equity, if you need equities projects, given the economics?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I appreciate that support, but at this point, we don't need equity.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): I was wondering, as you add all these wind farms on and all the capacity here, kind of a follow up to Paul's question, what additional investment do you need that might not already be anticipated? And kind of, if you go back to previous projects you've got, what have you found either in terms of operating costs or capital costs that were needed in addition to the price tag for the actual turbines installation?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, listen, let me take this two ways, I'll answer your question directly. When we price out the economics of these wind farms, we assume any kind of incremental ancillary costs that might be occurred, and I think we do a very good job of realistically looking at that, the additional transmission build-out, et cetera, Travis. Wind is fuel, and hence Steel for Fuel. And I do think that opens up the opportunity to have dialogues with our key stakeholders around the retirement of some of our fossil plants, principally, coal plants. And if you look forward, I think what that does for us is the opportunity to do more Steel for Fuel, and more steel, frankly, as we get beyond this forecast period. I mentioned in my remarks that Governor Hickenlooper issued an executive order in Colorado. I think that's going to create another wave of opportunities for us to add more renewables to the system as we start to look at the potential retirements of some coal plants. But again, this tranche of renewables wind, we can integrate into our system with some ancillary costs, which are baked into the LCOEs that we're quoting to our commissions.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And at what level do you think you'll start running into some of those integration issues (26:36) percentage of wind or other renewables on the system intermittent?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So we're going to continue to advance carbon reduction. and we're going to do that with affordability in mind. I think we're uniquely positioned to do that. I'm really pleased to see some of my colleagues are doing the same thing, I think it's the right thing to do. And when we start to get to those next incremental tranches, we start looking I think more at solar and wind, then you have to start looking at potential coal retirements, replacing that with a portion of backup gas, most likely CT, to make sure we have a reliability and other things we need on our system in the ramping capacity. So Travis, that's probably in the 2020s that when we start to really aggressively do that. I am really excited about it. I think the energy future for our jurisdictions is going to be a bright one. I think we can achieve remarkable de-carbonization goals and I think we can do that would affordability in mind, and that's what we're striving to do every single day.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll go next to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. So what does it mean, concurrent recovery? Is it a rider? Is it a forward text year? How do you envision that for SPS?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Angie, I think we can be pretty flexible, actually, how we get that concurrent recovery. And there's a number of different – I think we made a suggestion in the filing and we're open to the ideas. But the important thing is that we don't suffer the lag as we traditionally have done. So those settlement discussions are taking place, and there's different pathways we can take to achieve those outcomes. We're not really wedded to anything as long as we get what we need from real-time recovery.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And would you need legislative actions in order to get it done?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And now, so I know that nothing is happening in Washington, but what if there were to be a change in the corporate tax rate, how would it play into your plan for adding renewables? Would you ever consider maybe using tax equity investors to help you monetize the tax benefits of the wind farms?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, that's a really great question, Angie. While nothing seems to be happening in Washington, we're spending, I know I am, with some of my colleagues, making sure we advocate for the right kind of tax reform if it were to happen, and that basically, we don't believe the trade for 100% capital expense in exchange for non-deductibility of the interest expense is a good trade at all for shareholders or customers. And frankly, we've told them that bonus depreciation isn't a good trade, if that means a higher effective tax rate. And I think, by the way, we've gotten a good traction on that. So I think our industry is being recognized by legislators as unique. Where tax reform goes? I don't know. I mean, I've said that all along when this was all talked about. We'll see where it goes. I think we'll always be opportunistic if things like tax equity makes sense we would look at it, but that's not our plans right now.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm asking simply because when you calculate the benefits right to the customer, the present value of that benefit is highly dependent on your ability to monetize the tax credits, no? The timeframe over which you can monetize it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, these projects have a lot of tax benefits associated with them, so the effective tax rate does matter. But even if you stress test this to the max, these projects are still going to be good projects, and I think that's the key. And ultimately, I think as the technology improves, it will continue to be good values in the next when we talk fast forward 10 years from now, I think these technologies, even without tax benefits will compete very nicely with fossil fuel alternatives. So that's always something we have to be aware of and we are. We track it. But right now, I mean, they're deeply in the money for our customers.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Zou (31:30) with Avon Capital Advisors.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Hey, Ben, it's Andy Levi. How are you doing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, how are you doing?
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Good. Very good quarter for you guys, as always. Just very quick, similar question that was asked earlier, and that I've asked in the past. So as it's obvious, you're trending very easily towards, I think you said, and obviously some other callers, I think it was Ali, towards the high end of your 4% to 6% growth rate, I guess it's somewhat, I don't want to say, in the bag. But at what point – and I've asked this on every call over the last couple of quarters, do you really take a look at changing that growth rate, and at the very least, eliminating the low end?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, we'll continue to look at it, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made. We've got some more things to do, Andy. We don't have the SPS wind deals approved. We got to watch and see how some of the rate cases, that Bob mentioned, proceed. So I mean, there are still some moving pieces. I'm comfortable letting you know that we're trending towards the top of that range, and that's what our goal is going to be. And as I said before, so I can't really add anything new to it, we'll continue to look and evaluate what we think our long-term growth rate is. I do agree with you that the actions we've taken and the success we've had so far would probably indicate that there's certainly much more opportunity to hit the 6% than there is risk that will only be at 4%. I hope people can be comfortable with that.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: And if everything kind of on the regulatory front, kind of goes your way, do you see yourself exceeding the 6%, or is the 6% kind of the max?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, that's the kind of the analysis we have to continue to do. And at this point, we're saying 4% to 6%, Andy. So I think I just got to leave it there.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Okay. And then just more of an industry question because kind of looking at what you guys are doing, and then obviously the big AEP announcement as well, and again, just thoughts on a very high level. But clearly, the utilities are being much more aggressive, extremely aggressive in kind of building out their own renewable footprints versus let's say several years ago, PPAs. So what do you think that means for kind of renewable developers, whether, I mean, obviously NextEra has an outstanding renewable business, and is growing in leaps and bounds. So maybe, they're not as effective. But then you have kind of marginal players like AGR and other smaller developers as well. So just kind of your thoughts on, is the market big enough to support them all or do we continue to see this trend whether it's large utilities like yours or Alliant, is another example, kind of just doing it on their own because economics are good and you're able to?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Andy, I guess, I would look at it this way. I mean, I think the overall pie is getting bigger. As renewables compete directly and win on economics versus the more traditional fossil alternative, that's means we're going to have a lot more renewables on the system. And we certainly are, and when I look forward to 2030, we're going to continue to advance smart renewables, large-scale renewables that save customers money. Now, how that happens? I think that depends. I do think NextEra is well-positioned. I mean, they do a good job. There's others that do a good job. But if you notice, even in the megawatts that we're going to own in this – what we talked about with wind, they're some significant component of build-own-transfer. And so I think you're going to see more and more of that from all developers where this is a prime time type of asset to own, and I think utilities are going to want to own these assets, and they're going to be looking to either self build as we've done or contract with developers to own those once they are getting ready to go into service under a build-own-transfer concept. So I think you will see less PPAs. But if the overall pie increases, I'm not sure everybody doesn't have a chance to participate in the market, at least the good ones.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Got it. Thank you so much.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Thanks Andy.
Operator: We'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for the follow up. Ben, you've obviously been on the forefront of renewable. Where are you with regards to storage and willing to put capital to work there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You talking like specifically batteries?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we're continuing to look at how batteries can be deployed on our system, and I think the prices have to come down more on our system. We're relatively low cost compared to other regions of the country. But I think they will come down, Paul, and I think battery technology will play an increasingly bigger role on our system. And you see stuff where renewables compared with batteries have come in at a pretty good price point. You can have some of that. I don't believe that renewables combined with batteries replace CT gas turbines completely. I mean, you still need that 24x7 backup capacity. You still need spinning mass on the system. There's a number of things like that. But I believe that you'll see us when the economics are right, be it ready to deploy batteries. In the meantime, we're doing it on a pilot basis to really understand all the value streams, how they stack up and how this can be a resource going forward. To me, it's not unlike solar where solar was 10 years ago. And as it gets ready for prime time, on our system, we'll look to invest in it.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Maybe prime time on your system a little bit later because you're already in such a good place from a price standpoint?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes, I mean, it will be driven by economics, but that said, I see that day coming, so we will be positioned to be there when it's ready.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks again.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel, CFO, for closing marks.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2017 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2017 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webcast. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Bob will discuss our quarterly results and provide a regulatory update. I want to give you a quick update on our steel-for-fuel program. We've made excellent progress on our steel-for-fuel strategy, and have proposed adding almost 3,400 megawatts of new wind to our systems by 2020. In addition, we plan to own more than 80% of this new wind generation. Let me give you a quick update on our major initiatives. As we've previously discussed, the Colorado Commission approved our 600-megawatt Rush Creek wind project in 2016. Rush Creek is progressing as planned and is expected to go into service in 2018. In Minnesota, we recently proposed adding 1,550 megawatts of new wind generation, which reflects ownership of 1,150 megawatts and power purchase agreements of 400 megawatts. We have requested that the Minnesota Commission approve this proposal no later than July. Finally, we also recently proposed adding 1,000 megawatts of self-build wind and 230 megawatts of power purchase agreements in Texas and New Mexico. We have requested that the commissions approve these projects and associated recovery mechanisms by the end of the year. As a result of our safe harbor actions in 2016, we're able to secure 100% of the production tax credit benefits and maximize savings for our customers. Based on current forecast, we estimate billions of dollars of savings over the life of these projects, which will offset the capital cost to the benefit of our customers. In addition to the financial benefits, we expect to continue our long trend of decarbonization and realize CO2 reductions of at least 45% by 2021. These are very exciting times for Xcel Energy as we continue to transform our fleet in a cost-effective manner. Our continued commitment to carbon reduction and renewables growth has once again been recognized by the American Wind Energy Association. Just last week, Xcel Energy was named the number one energy provider for the 12th consecutive year. This demonstrates our long-term vision and commitment to environmental leadership. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob who will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook and a regulatory update.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We realized another solid quarter of earnings of $0.47 per share in 2017, compared with $0.47 per share in 2016. The most significant earnings driver for the quarter include: higher electric margins, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to rate cases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments; and a lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to wind production tax credits, which flow back to our customers. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share; higher interest expenses, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share; and other items, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Weather was warmer than normal for the first quarter this year and for the first quarter of last year. As a result, our electric and natural gas margins had a combined $0.01 per share adverse weather impact as compared to last year. However, when compared to normal, warm temperatures in the first quarter reduced earnings by $0.035 per share. Despite the impact of warm winter weather, our first quarter results remained consistent with our internal budget due to our continued focus on cost management. Our O&M expenses were $9 million higher in the quarter. However, this increase was driven by $8 million of O&M expenses that were deferred from 2016 due to the timing of our Texas electric rate case settlement approval. This higher expense in Texas was equally offset by additional revenue. Our objective is to keep total O&M expenses relatively in line with 2016 expenses. We continue to focus on increasing productivity as we finish up the implementation of our new work management system across the company, which is progressing extremely well and will be fully completed by year-end. Turning to sales. On a weather and leap year adjusted basis, our electric sales improved 0.3%, reflecting approximately 1% growth in the number of customers across most customer classes and jurisdictions, offset by lower use per customer. Our first quarter sales were in line with our full-year forecast of 0% to 0.5% growth. Next, let me provide a quick regulatory update. In March, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement in the Minnesota multi-year rate case. It indicated the settlement will contribute to establishing just and reasonable rates. The commission is expected to deliberate in May and issue an order in June. As a reminder, we've been collecting interim rates since January of 2016. In Colorado, we have several regulatory proceedings before the commission. In our decoupling docket, hearings are complete and we expect a commission decision in the next month or so. In our advanced grid certificate of need proceeding, we are in settlement discussions with several of the interveners and have made significant progress. As a result, we'll likely spread out the capital investment associated with advanced grid over a longer period of time to minimize the customer impact. Hearings are scheduled for May and we expect a final decision in mid-2017. Last week, the New Mexico Commission dismissed our rate case, claiming the filing was incomplete and did not include all the required jurisdictional cost information. We disagree with this assessment and feel the decision to dismiss our rate case was overly punitive. Our filing was consistent with past filings and included all the required cost allocation information. While New Mexico is a very small portion of our business, the decision is disappointing. We have filed for reconsideration and will consider our legal options. Finally, we plan to file rate cases in Colorado and Wisconsin during the second quarter. We expect decisions in these cases by year-end or early in 2018. As Ben discussed, we filed wind proposals at both NSP-Minnesota and SPS. The combination of these proposals and previously approved Rush Creek project could result in us owning an incremental 2,750 megawatts of wind generation by 2020. This equates to approximately $4.2 billion of capital investment for renewable projects for the 2017 to 2021 period, if the commission approves all projects. We'll formally update our capital forecast later in the year when we have more clarity on both the incremental wind and our advanced grid proposals. At that time, we also will roll forward our forecast to 2018 to 2022. We expect that the net effect of the new wind and advanced grid initiatives will extend our capital investment growth period, manage the customer bill impact and minimize financing requirements. This is all part of our strategy to continue to improve asset health, decarbonize our fleet and lower customer bills, which deliver long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders. With that, I'll wrap up. We posted solid results for the quarter. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy with wind proposals, followed by NSP-Minnesota and SPS. We're on track to deliver our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. In addition, we increased our dividend 6%, consistent with our goal of 5% to 7% growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: We'll hear first from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Morning, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. Ben or Bob, in your original CapEx budget that you read out for us 2017 through 2021, of those $18.4 billion, at that time, there was a placeholder 9% you were calling other. Given all of these projects that you've laid out, is it fair to say it's not only the 9% other being filled by those projects, but we've actually exceeded $18.4 billion? How should I be thinking of the total cumulative number now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Ali, are you talking about the placeholder we had for renewables?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. Well, clearly, if we get all of these projects approved and ultimately built, that would add about $700 million to that particular placeholder, that renewables placeholder. I do think it's important for you to recognize too though that there are moving parts. We'll probably extend some of our work on the advanced grid initiatives beyond 2021. In addition, we'll continue to look for steel-for-fuel. And we'll put all that together and wrap that around an updated forecast, which will come out in the third quarter. Of course, as you know, Ali, at that timeframe, we'll drop 2017 and add 2022. Recognize 2017 as a fairly heavy CapEx year for us. So I think the takeaway is, we continue to have really solid organic growth opportunities.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And so, again, from a big picture perspective, as you look at all the pluses and minuses, Ben, is the CAGR that you've laid out for us still where it is roughly, or has it gone up, or how should we think about that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think, again it's a lot of moving parts, but I think through the 2021 timeframe, we've got more upside than anything else. But I don't think you should just take $700 million and add that to the CapEx.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, Bob, also remind us, how much cushion or headroom do you have from a balance sheet perspective in terms of – if CapEx does go up, how much more CapEx can you absorb without having to hit the equity markets?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'm going to turn it over to Bob. But, Ali, we've got a great balance sheet and, as you know, we don't have to do any equity at the 2018 for CapEx in this timeframe.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Ali, we've reviewed this capital plan with the agencies, and they were comfortable with our financing plan. If we had any material change to our forward capital plan, we'd obviously go back and work with the agencies on the financing plan for any change in that forecast. But, right now, I think we're comfortable with where we're at. And as Ben indicated, we don't expect to issue equity under this capital plan.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. But, Bob, is it fair to say that there is probably some more headroom, even if that 2018 floor were higher, there may still be some more headroom for you to go above that and still not have to issue equity?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think we've pushed those analytics that far, Ali. I mean, suffice to say that if we decided to spend more capital and we had more initiatives, I think you'd have to think about the character of that capital, what years it would come in relative to our current forecast. As you know, with this wind build, we've got 2018, 2019 and 2020 are pretty high capital years for the company. So, if you're talking about adding capital in 2021 or something different, that's different than adding capital to the front end of that cycle. So I think there's a lot of moving pieces in that question.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And then, as you lay out in the slide deck on LTM last 12-month basis earned ROE at the opco level was 8.81%. Can you just remind us what's kind of baked into the 2017 guidance in terms of earned ROE? And how much regulatory lag would that still imply, assuming you hit your targets?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Sure. As you imply, in the slide deck, we referenced what is the regulated operating company ROE on a consolidated regulated basis of around 8.8%. That's a little bit lower than our run rate at 12/31, predominately due to the weather impacts in the first quarter. We expect 2017 to look a lot like 2016 in terms of earned ROE. And when you think about that as compared to our allowed ROEs, our weighted average allowed is probably 9.6%, so that leaves an ROE gap of 50 to 60 basis points.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And is that a natural gap we should think about from a fictional point of view or would that be practically filled up as well?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We always try to close that gap. It's been a strategic initiative for the company for a while. Obviously, as you're building in regulatory jurisdictions that have historic test years and lag periods in rate-makings, that's going to cause some natural lag. And there's some items that cause some natural leakage. But I think that that's a focus area for the customer to continue to try and close that gap.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: And, Ali, part of our plan always has been to go into these longer-term regulatory compacts, which allow us to more effectively, I believe, manage to the revenue streams that we've been provided. And I think we're in the early days of what we can accomplish on sustainable cost control and process improvement. Clearly, we need to take a look at what happens at the macro level with overall revenues, et cetera, but our goal is to continue to close that gap.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: How are you?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Good. Thank you very much. Perhaps just a follow-up on that last comment, just if I can, topical. Can you elaborate a little bit? You said early days of what we can accomplish, I think. I take that to mean that you have confidence in addressing that 50 to 60 basis points of ROE gap on a trailing basis here. Is that a fair statement? Or is that rather a statement when you were saying early days that, at least, you can stay out of rate cases or something like that? And I'll leave it there.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, it's kind of all of the above, Julien. Our vision is to continue to decarbonize and do so in a way that allows us to save customers money, which sets up the dialogue, can you stay out of rate cases. And I think there's more to come on that. I think what we're seeing in our early efforts and initiatives to really focus on cost, I mean, it makes us confident that we can keep O&M flat. Can we do more? Well, we'll see. But I think it positions us very well going forward to manage the company. And part of that successful management will be to close that gap between what we actually earn and what we're authorized to earn. And I want to make it clear that there's always going to be some structural limitations there. I mean, things that our regulators don't allow us to recover, for example, executive comp, which is very important. Not to be too silly. But we'll continue to work towards closing that, as Bob mentioned, off of an average 9.6% and I think you'll continue to see us make progress.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Back to our regularly scheduled question. On the Colorado side, I'd be very curious; do you see the ability to expand the owned component of the wind? You've obviously scaled up your commitments in the other jurisdictions thus far. Perhaps, if not now, when would you next evaluate more of this similar fuel-for-steel component?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think we had a breakthrough, as you know, Julien, with Rush Creek. And that's owned, and that was a departure from the past. But just to step back, I absolutely do. I think we've demonstrated that we can build and own and do so at a fantastic price point for our customers, and it's our intention to expand upon that. And I firmly believe too, as we transition to this cleaner energy future, that we are the natural owner of many of these assets and should be and, quite frankly, have earned the right to be.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And there's no natural cadence that we should expect to come out at some point for the expansion of Rush Creek or what have you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'm not sure about the natural cadence of timing. Well, we're going to continue to look for opportunities. We file our standard resource plans. A lot of it has to do with what's next in decarbonization. So I don't know if that's a continuous kind of thing, like a little bit each quarter, or if it's going to be a little more lumpy as we go forward. But we will be going forward and that is the overall plan.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And just last follow-up question real quickly, a little bit of a scenario. For New Mexico, if you can elaborate, if unsuccessful in the rehearing petition here, would you simply seek to re-file at an appropriate point in time? I'm just curious, if you're unsuccessful on that route, what the next step is and the timing of that next step?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: To your point, first thing is hopefully get a successful reconsideration. We will look at legal options, including a petition to the Supreme Court. Julien, I don't think there's any merit to justify dismissing this case. There really isn't. But to your last point, yeah, and ultimately we'll look at re-filing the case in as quick as manner as possible to minimize the lag that we're suffering from. And I think we can do – I think all of those options can provide that pathway we need.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Julien.
Operator: Travis Miller with Morningstar has the next question.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Trav.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Trav.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Wonder if you could clarify again the renewable builds. So those projects that you went through and listed at the beginning, are there any in there or are they all incremental to what you've previously announced and what was in the CapEx plan? I don't know whether I caught that.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Take that, Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So what we discussed today was the totality of the newbuilds in each of our jurisdictions. Ben mentioned Rush Creek, that's been previously in our capital plan and was approved by the Colorado Commission, and it's under construction. We announced new wind in our Upper Midwest system, 1,550 megawatts, 750 megawatts of self-build, 400 megawatts of build transfer and 400 megawatts of PPAs. I think what was new was probably the 400 megawatts of the self-build proposal, which, as Ben indicated, could be somewhere around $700 million of capital if all of our projects were approved, in addition to the original capital program. And then, obviously in the Southwest, at our SPS Company, we had a 1,000 megawatts of self-build and 200 megawatts of PPAs. And I think all of that 1,000 megawatts of self-build is included in our capital estimates that we talked about back at EEI.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, Travis, maybe the way to think about it is, we were quite confident when we put that placeholder out for $3.5 billion that we would be able to find those steel-for-fuel opportunities and as Bob mentioned, for example, the self-build opportunities in the SPS jurisdictions, et cetera. But what we have found is that some of the bids were so compelling, and particularly some of the build-own-transfer bids, that not only did we fill our estimate of the $3.5 billion, but we've actually exceeded it with what is now on the table.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. I get that. Was that 400 megawatts, the $700 million incremental all in Minnesota or it's spread out across jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: All in the Upper Midwest, so it's all in the NSP.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): NSP. Okay. And then, given that you guys had pretty flat earning, even if you adjust for the weather in this quarter, what time of year this year do you get that 6%? What kind of quarter should we be looking at in terms of reaching that 6%, the annual growth rate?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Travis, with the challenging weather we saw in the first quarter, we expect – and our plan is actually expected the back half of the year to have higher earnings in the first quarter anyway. So I don't think that the weather in and of itself prevents us from achieving our earnings. In fact, we're confirming our earnings as part of this call.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): And the back half of the year being where you'd get most of that growth to reach to 6% type level?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It would be in the final three quarters, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): I was guessing that.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Obviously definitive.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): My astute analysis came at that point.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: ...expenses aren't recovered either but...
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Indeed. I will model that in. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll now move to our next question that will come from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jon.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jon.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Ben, I think...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Steel-for-fuel, Jonathan. Steel-for-fuel.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So question on that. You said, I think, that we shouldn't sort of add the incremental beyond the $3.5 billion to our view of CapEx through 2021 because some other things may move around. And you specifically mentioned that you might push out advanced grid somewhat. What's driving that? Because if – presumably, it's not going to build impact, because steel-for-fuel is going to be saving people money, right?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Steel-for-fuel is definitely self-funding and I'd say it's a lot of money for our customers. But when you're investing in the grid, there is an impact to the consumer on that. And so we're just working, particularly in Colorado, with our stakeholders, the staff, regulators, et cetera, to make sure that the plan is within the pocketbook, if you will, on an annual basis from a customer's perspective. So we're not changing anything. I mean we're still going to move forward with all the advanced grid initiatives, but we might just go at a little bit more gradual pace. I don't think it's a major change. I just wanted to point that out to you. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities to optimize our capital spend from a consumer standpoint. At the same time, Jonathan, we continue to look for more steel-for-fuel opportunities. So the whole point there was – it's a little more complicated than just adding the CapEx to the $3.5 billion and saying that's the new CapEx forecast, which is why we update it on an annual basis, and we continue to plan to do that.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, that was just an example of something that you might be just re-pacing a little?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think that's fair.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, you've brought it up, so what's a good timeframe to be thinking about the next round of steel-for-fuel?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, we're always looking. We always have opportunities and we're working with stakeholders across the board. I mean, I don't have anything specific to report on, but there's always activity.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then, just finally, I don't know – one of the reasons cited for dismissing the New Mexico case was – it had to do with allocation between the jurisdictions. So I'm curious, how do you manage against that becoming an issue in the wind filing you'll be making? And have you kind of given an indication of how that cost is going to shake out between the jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think that really will be an issue with the wind filings. And quite frankly, I don't think it was an issue with our rate case filing. It was made an issue, to be perfectly blunt about it. And the key with these wind filings is, I think it's well-recognized that this is going to be very good for customers. It's going to be very good for regional economic development. And again, I think the amount of money that we're saving the customers, I think, justifies better regulatory recovery of not only the wind, but in general, better treatment for that region of the country, particularly New Mexico.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And have you said how this will sort of break down in terms of who gets the largest share of that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, it's an integrated system. So just let me turn to – what is typically – I know, the wholesale, there's Texas and then there's New Mexico...
Marvin E. McDaniel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Texas is; this is Marvin. Jonathan. Texas is about 50%, wholesale is about 30% and New Mexico is about 20%. And so that...
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, that would be a – is that a sensible rule of thumb to be thinking about it?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's just a rule of thumb on the sales. And then I'd add to Ben's response about allocation. The question in the New Mexico case was finding the allocated cost drivers. The question was not with regards to how much was allocated to New Mexico. So it wasn't an issue of the cost being allocated. It was the issue of finding the information.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Marvin E. McDaniel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You're right. Again, we believe and it was all included in our filing.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And now we will hear from Chris Turner with JPMorgan.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Chris?
Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase: Good morning. Ben, I think you had touched on this a little bit in the last question. But when we think about what – I think you anticipate it as a year-end decision for the wind at SPS. My understanding is it's not part of an integrated resource plan process, like was the case in Minnesota. So how do you think about regulatory strategy there in your ask? How do you think about rate recovery, customer bills, et cetera, there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I know this is going to save customers money. And so our ask is that, just like the customer gets immediate savings, we should be getting immediate recovery of those investments. That's the basic premise of our regulatory ask.
Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. And then, just the idea that this is a money-saving investment for customers do you think would be enough to convince the two commissions to give it a green light as opposed to a need for new generation in and of itself?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. The question will always be – I think everybody's going to be really appreciative of the customer savings, and what we have to do is convince them that there's a need to also to take care of the company and its shareholders that are putting up the capital for these investments. And that's concurrent recovery.
Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. And then, switching to Colorado, I think there's two potential filings this year. How can we think about the timing and kind of other considerations there? And should we assume that the content of the electric case will be another standard three-year multi-year ask? And then, on the gas side kind of a forward-looking one-year ask, and kind of hoping to get that versus the historical test year that you've been awarded ask a couple of times?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I would think you, on both, the effort will be to do enter into multi-year plans. If I was going to handicap, then I would say we're very confident on the electric side and cautiously optimistic on the gas side.
Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. And no other changes to strategy there or indications of when you're going to file?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Chris, I think we indicated that we expect to file gas and electric probably in the next quarter or so separately but shortly thereafter each other. And so I don't think the strategy on the timing of the filing is any different than what we've previously communicated.
Christopher Turner - JPMorgan Chase: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Morning, Andy.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: How are you guys doing? I think most of my questions were asked. One question. When may you possibly revisit the long-term earnings growth rate, if you do at all?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, we'll periodically look at it. I will tell you, Andy, that we're certainly positioned in this period to be at the upper end of that 4% to 6%.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Okay. And do you review that on an annual basis? Would that be something maybe when you come out with your new capital plan that you would take a look at it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, there's no set timeframe. So it's – we look at it periodically and when we feel it needs to be adjusted, if it does need to be adjusted, we react accordingly.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Okay. And then the second question I have is just – and you've alluded to it and then there was some Q&A on it too. But just on the cost savings potential or in the sense making the company more efficient, it sounds like you're in kind of the early innings for that. Is that kind of a good way to categorize it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'll let Bob answer it.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Andy, that's a good way to characterize some of the initiatives we have in progress, including our productivity through technology initiative. But, as you know and are well aware, we've held our O&M costs flat for the past three years and our guidance is to keep them in that range. And so, as we continue to look at different ways to continue to bend the cost curve, whether it's through supply chain, commercialization efforts or technology that drives efficiency, you should expect the company to continue to look for opportunities to continue to bend the cost curve.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Okay. But, again, but just timing-wise, I guess you've been doing it for a while, but then what you continued to find opportunities and I guess part of that is based on new technology and things like that. Is that correct?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think that's a fair way to characterize. I mean, we do have structural cost increases in the company, whether it's bargaining unit labor agreement or other labor merit and inflationary pressures or third-party contractual arrangements that may have inflators in them. So we constantly have to bend the cost curve just to stay flat and we're very aggressively attempting to do that.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And now we'll hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Steve?
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions are answered. Just a technical question with the build-own-transfers. Could you just talk a little bit about how the kind of AFDC and kind of earnings profile of them are the same or different versus just normal rate base? Is it more just when you actually transact at the end?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes. Steve, that's the right way to look at it. On the build-own-transfer, we won't earn AFUDC under construction. It's just a capital transfer at the close of the transaction.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: So both the cap, yeah?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You'd only earn AFUDC if there's a progress payment. And we don't really have progress payments in these projects.
Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. So both your earnings and financing will all come right at the end because you're not financing anything either as it's being built? Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will end your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel, CFO, for any closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thanks, everybody, for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give our Investor Relations department a call.
Operator: With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your call for today. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Year-End 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions. This morning, we will review 2016 results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release, in our filings with the SEC. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain ongoing earnings metrics that are non-GAAP measures. The comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation are included in the earnings release, which is available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I will begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, which was a great year financially, strategically and operationally. Let me start with the financial results. We had another strong year with ongoing EPS of $2.21 in 2016 compared with $2.09 per share in 2015. This represents an ongoing EPS growth rate of 5.7%, which is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% growth objective. This was our 12th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance. We also raised our dividend by 6.3% to $1.36 per share in 2016. This was the 13th straight year we've increased our dividend. Turning to strategy, in 2016, we introduced our steel-for-fuel strategy. Because of the strong wind resources in our service territories, we have a unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs can be offset by fuel savings. As a result, we are planning to invest about $3.5 billion in renewables over the next five years. So, let me give you a quick update on some of our major initiatives. The Colorado 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind project was approved by the Commission last year and is progressing as planned. Rush Creek is expected to go in service in 2018. In Minnesota, we are seeking to add 1,500 megawatts of new wind generation, which reflects an RFP for PPAs or Build-Own-Transfer projects, and our own self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation. As part of the RPF process, we received proposals from 17 bidders with 95 proposals for almost 10,000 megawatts of wind generation, featuring a combination of PPAs and Build-Own-Transfer projects. We've analyzed the bids, developed a shortlist and are negotiating with the developers. We believe our 750 megawatt self-build wind proposal is competitive and will complement the RFP portfolio. We plan to follow recommendation with the Minnesota Commission later in the first quarter, and we expect a decision in the summer. We also continue to make progress on the $1.5 billion of undefined renewable projects, which are included in our capital forecast. We're working with various stakeholders and are in advanced discussions with site developers about adding 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of wind generation at SPS. And we expect to share further details later in the year. Finally, last year, we entered into a wind turbine supply agreement with Vestas, which provides us the flexibility to develop up to 2,500 megawatts of wind generation. This agreement allows us to secure 100% of the PTC benefit and maximize the fuel savings for our customers. It's all part of our steel-for-fuel strategy. We have strong wind resources with high capacity factors in our service territories. We have support for the development of renewable projects from state policymakers, interested stakeholders and our customers. And we've taken timely actions to secure the full utilization of the wind Production Tax Credits. As a result, we expect the fuel savings on wind projects will more than offset the capital cost and that's what steel-for-fuel's all about. We also had a strong year in operations. In 2016, we successfully completed the construction of a 200-megawatt Courtney Wind Farm in North Dakota, and we did it on time and under budget. This was our first wind project in which we were the general contractor and is further evidence of our ability to develop, manage and construct wind projects. While the project took 15 months to complete, you can watch the entire construction process in a three-minute time-lapse video posted on our website. I think it's a fascinating video and I encourage you to check it out. We had an excellent operational and safety year in 2016 and I want to take a moment to thank all of the Xcel employees who work hard throughout the year and always put safety and customers first. We had several challenging storms in our service territories recently and we responded with industry-leading efficiency. One example was the wave of intense storms that hit our service territories over the Christmas weekend, resulting in more than 100,000 customer outages. Our crews braved frigid temperatures and unusually icy conditions to restore power safely and quickly so that our customers could enjoy the holidays. And just recently, ice storm Jupiter ripped through Texas, impacting 58,000 customers, many of them in small towns and remote locations. Once again, our field crews and supporting teams worked around the clock to restore power to our customers in a timely fashion. Finally, Minnesota legislators recently introduced a bill which would allow us to build a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at our Sherco site. We originally proposed this plan, along with the addition of renewables, as part of our Resource Plan, which enables the early retirement of two coal units at the Sherco site. The Minnesota Commission acknowledged the capacity need and the benefits of siting new generation at the existing plant site, but elected to defer a decision to a later date, which would require us to file a Certificate of Need. The bill was driven by legislators who are concerned about the loss of jobs and tax revenue and wanted to expedite the decision process. It's important to note we have provided extensive justification for the plant, and the Commission will still need to approve cost recovery for the power plant. The bill has passed the Energy Committee in the House, but will require approval in both the full House and Senate, along with approval of the Governor. We expect to get final resolution later in the year. If the bill is not passed, then we would plan to file a Certificate of Need. Please note, this facility is not included in our capital forecast, and any potential capital investment would likely occur after 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and he will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, as well as a regulatory update.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Ben, and good morning. My comments today will focus predominantly on full-year 2016 results. For details of our fourth quarter results, please see our earnings release that was distributed this morning and posted on our website. As Ben indicated, we realized another strong year of operational and financial performance and delivered 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.21 per share compared with $2.09 per share of ongoing earnings in 2015. The most significant earnings drivers for the year include higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.36 per share, largely due to rate increases and non-fuel riders to recover our capital investments; and a lower effective income tax rate, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to wind Production Tax Credits in 2016, which flow back to our customers. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions, which reduced earnings by $0.21 per share, and higher interest expenses and property taxes, which combined reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. Another key driver to our EPS outcome was our disciplined approach to O&M expenses. For the third year in a row, Xcel Energy has maintained no growth in operating and maintenance expenses. While we're proud of our discipline, we remain committed to actively managing our cost for the benefits of our customers. Our objective is to continue our trend of no growth in O&M, which we expect to achieve through a continued focus on operational and commercial excellence as well as productivity improvements through the use of technology. Based on our track record, you should be confident in our ability to achieve this objective. Turning to sales, as we've discussed each quarter, we've seen a slight slowdown in both gas and electric sales in 2016. On a weather- and leap-year-adjusted basis, we experienced a full year electric sales decline of 0.3% for 2016. Our positive residential sales growth was offset by lower C&I sales in most jurisdictions. Natural gas sales declined 1% in 2016 on a weather- and leap-year-adjusted basis. We continue to see positive customer growth in our service territories for both the electric and natural gas businesses, but that growth has been offset by lower use per customer, primarily driven by improvements in energy efficiency. 2016 was a very productive year in terms of regulatory proceedings, and let me touch on a few of the highlights. We reached a four-year settlement in our Minnesota rate case, which is pending Commission approval. We reached constructive outcomes in our Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas rate cases. The Minnesota Commission approved our Resource Plan, which will result in significant carbon reductions due to the early retirement of two coal units and the addition of wind and solar generation. We filed requests with the Colorado Commission for approval of partial decoupling mechanism and for a Certificate of Need for the Advanced Grid initiative. We expect decisions on both initiatives later in the second quarter. Let me provide some detail on our Texas rate case, which was approved by the Commission last week. We settled the case earlier in the year, and the key terms include a base rate increase of $35.2 million, power factor revenue of $12.6 million, and recovery of $4 million of rate case expenses in a separate proceeding. We believe the outcomes in both Texas and New Mexico rate cases reflect an improving regulatory environment in SPS. Next, I want to spend just a moment on tax reform. It certainly has been topical for the industry and is a key component of the pro-growth agenda of the new Congress and administration. We believe we are in early innings of this process. And given the complicated nature of comprehensive tax reform, we believe we have several quarters until we get additional clarity on likely outcomes. And while we believe things will continue to evolve, we have analyzed two potential tax reform scenarios and their potential impact on Xcel Energy. The first scenario is essentially the executive branch plan, which reflects a 20% corporate tax rate, maintains interest deductibility and does not include 100% bonus depreciation. Under this scenario, the impact will be mildly accretive to our earnings in 2021 due to a reduction in the deferred tax liability over time. The second scenario is essentially the House blueprint, which reflects a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% bonus depreciation. Under this scenario, the impact would be modestly dilutive to our earnings in 2021 due to the loss of interest deductibility and lower rate base. Longer term, we believe that the industry is permanently negatively impacted by the loss of interest deductibility. Accordingly, Xcel Energy will continue to work vigorously with EEI to advance the interests of our customers and our industry. Finally, we remain confident we can manage the potential impact of tax reform and deliver on our EPS and dividend growth objectives. With that, I'll wrap up. In summary, 2016 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered ongoing earnings within or above our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 13th straight year. We held O&M flat for the third consecutive year. We reached a settlement in the Minnesota Multiyear Rate Plan and resolved regulatory proceedings in Texas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. The Minnesota Commission approved our Resource Plan, which set the framework for the addition of renewable projects and the retirement of two coal facilities. This should result in 63% of the NSP System energy being carbon-free by 2030. We continue to execute on our steel-for-fuel strategy and we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, and our 5% to 7% dividend growth objective. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take any questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. First question, can you remind us embedded in your 2017 guidance what is the assumed earned ROE at the utility level compared to what you actually earned in 2016?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Ali, as you know, we've been – our ROEs in 2016, we didn't make a lot of progress over where we were in 2015, and that's primarily due to lower authorized ROEs. So, when I look at 2017 and when I look at 2018, we will continue to, I think, close that gap, albeit on a lower authorized ROE. We'll primarily do that through entering into multiyear plans. We expect approval in Minnesota of our multiyear plan and we expect we'll have another multiyear plan in Colorado. We'll combine that with our cost initiatives, and I think where that'll put us in 2018 is probably in the low 9s as far as blended utility ROEs. And so, we'll make steady progress towards that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And Ben, to your point, when we factor in the lower authorized ROE, assuming the Minnesota settlement is approved, when you factor that in, what is now the sort of regulatory lag when you run the math based on that new ROE at Minnesota?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, the lag is – you've cut into the lag significantly under the multiyear plans. It's just that it's at a lower base rate of 9.2%. So, I don't have the exact number. But I think we've probably got, what, about...
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I mean, Ali, another way to look at it, we're – if you look at 2016, we earned a little over 9.2% in Minnesota, so we're earning our authorized. The blended authorized ROE for the NSP – for the Xcel system is about 9.6% and currently we're earning about 9%. So, previously, the gap was about 90 basis points. Now, it's about 60 basis points.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And bulk of (17:39) that 9.6%, that factors in the 9.2% at – the new ROE at Minnesota?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Correct.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And my last question, coming back to the normalized electric sales trends, anything to read into the Q4 numbers turning negative? And does that influence at all? I think you've assumed flat to like 0.5% as kind of your growth numbers for 2017. You're still looking – that still looks good, or any changes given what you're seeing ending last year?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think the quarter is indicative of where we think trends will go. We are seeing good customer growth, Ali, in Colorado and Minnesota and other jurisdictions. That growth we are typically going to keep under the decoupling mechanisms either in place or proposed. You put it all together, though, and we think the long-term trend's that zero to 0.5% growth.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Well done.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien. Thanks.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So, I wanted to just ask a quick follow-up on this legislative angle real quickly. You kind of describe a timeline issue and a reason to be expeditious to pursue this via legislation instead of a traditional route, you talk about. What is that difference in timing as you perceive it right now, net-net? And also, just to be clear, you talk about it as being beyond the current Resource Plan, what's the timing if you get the legislation done versus not as well, just in terms of in-service and where that – just how far out that is?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. I don't know if I heard the first part of your question, Julien. So, could you repeat that again?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Sorry. I apologize for the signal (19:41). I was really asking about what is the timeline difference between pursuing the legislative approach versus the traditional Certificate of Need approach in Minnesota?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, if we get the legislation that could happen fairly quickly. It is, we do – our latest update says it's progressing very fast and it could be to the Governor by the end of this month. A Certificate of Need we would be filing later in the year. And we've got Chris Clark, who's the President of NSP, when would that get done most likely, Chris?
Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Typically, the Certificate of Needs take about 18 months. They can take as long as two years to proceed through that. So, the legislation would eliminate the need for some of that proceeding, Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And so, Julien, that's why the legislation is being proposed because the constituents at Becker, where the Sherco site is located, are worried about tax base loss, and they want to preserve as many jobs as possible. And as an aside, we've been working very closely with those stakeholders and driving other forms of economic development to the region as well. So, our plan has always been about pragmatic decarbonization. But we're also very respectful and understanding of the communities that are impacted and trying to minimize that impact. And our proposal to the Commission did just that. And again, I think our legislators like to just move it along a little quicker. As your last part of your question...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The expenditures, and I think that would be roughly $800 million. That would occur post-2021 and would be consistent with the shutdown of the units, which I think take place in 2023?
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: 2026.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes. Okay.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. So, it would be in service around 2026 either way?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes. That's today's plan.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. And then a bigger picture question. Just if you can remind us, perhaps tailing off of Ali's question as well, where do you stand within your growth rate, as far as your execution on the earned ROE improvement? And how do you improve it from here? Should we be looking for more capital, more fuel-for-steel element to drive you to the upper end, or are we talking about the earned ROE improvement to be the principal driver at this point as well?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think it's a combination. Our rate base growth is in the upper 5%. So, I mean, we're clearly focused on executing on what we have embedded in our capital plans. That would be the proposal here in Minnesota. It would be developing specific projects, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to cover that $1.5 billion of renewables in our CapEx program. So, if you execute on that, you execute on the – getting the settlement on the multiyear plan in Minnesota, you get another multiyear plan in Colorado. Then our cost initiatives should improve the ROE, as I mentioned. And you put all that together, and I think it would bode pretty well for our EPS growth rate over the next five years.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. So, upper end, clearly?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, there's a lot of execution that goes with that. But that would certainly be what we'd be shooting for.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Great, guys. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just focusing on the 2017 guidance factors that you provide, it seemed like a number of them have gone in the wrong direction versus the EEI update, and probably add up to best part of a nickel negative. Are there some other things you don't call out that are going to go – are going to offset some of that pressure, pension maybe, or are those – is that direction correct within the range for this year?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I'll let Bob give you some details, Jonathan. But I mean, I think most of those are just truing up for where we landed in 2016. That said, we did have a holdco debt issuance at the end of the year. So we will pick up a little interest expense associated with that. But we believe it's very manageable. And I can just tell you that our outlook on our ability to land guidance really remains unchanged. So, Bob, I don't know if you want to add any color to that?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I mean, Ben – Jon, I think that Ben said it all. We true up, as we do with every guidance assumption, and we have ranges. We think that with respect to some of the capital accounts, the depreciation and the rider revenues ,that we can manage within those ranges. And then, as Ben said, the interest expense was both a mark-to-market on what we see in the market since EEI, as well as the holdco bond that we did back in December. So we think it's all manageable. It's a couple of pennies. And I think we can manage through that this year.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then just on the Minnesota wind, Ben, I think you used the word, you're confident that your self-build proposal would complement the RFP.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Right.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I just want to make sure I remember the numbers correctly. You're looking for 1,000 megawatts overall, is that correct? Of which you've submitted a 750 megawatts self-build?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. I think, based upon the robustness of the bidding, I think we're looking at 1,500 megawatts. We have a 750-megawatt self-build proposal, as you know. Our pricing is very competitive with that, and we've also seen competitive PPAs and competitive Build-Own-Transfer. So, it leads me to believe that, at the end of the day, we'll have ownership opportunities for 750 megawatts, potentially some upside there, but at this point, that's what our assumption is.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, you're feeling good that your 750 megawatts will be part of the overall package, basically?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I got a cold, but I'm feeling good about the RFP process.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, thank you for that, and I hope you feel better.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wondering, given that we're now probably not going to see any kind of carbon legislation or cuts, et cetera, at the federal level, how do you think that impacts what Minnesota regulators, even politicians, might be thinking is necessary at the state level as you go through another round of Resource Plan?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for that question, Travis, because I think it's a really important thing to talk about. I actually think that it strengthens our Resource Plans and what we're trying to accomplish, because we've always been about approaching carbon reduction from a pragmatic standpoint. I mean, steel-for-fuel is a great example of that; never losing sight of customer affordability, never losing sight of reliability, not being really interested in running massive science experiments. And so, there have been times, despite our environmental leadership, where we've been critical of some public policies and other things, which we didn't think it was the most pragmatic, efficient way to get things done. So, I now think there's more opportunity to rally around our plans, which have always been pragmatic. And that's in Minnesota, that's in Colorado. And I think you continue to advance the ball there, because it just makes economic sense. And by the way, the economic sense is what we'd be reporting to you later in the year about what's taking place in SPS where that would be driven by economics. So, it's a little counterintuitive, but I actually think it makes what we've been proposing that much more appealing.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. And then just remind me what the timing cycle is for the IRP process going forward.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: In what state?
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Resource Plan.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: In Minnesota?
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Minnesota, yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You want to take that, Chris?
Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben. We'll file for the approval of the wind projects that are selected in the first quarter. And then, to the extent that we have additional filings for the next Resource Plan, the Commission has asked for that in 2019. So the immediate focus is going to be in advancing those wind proposals this year.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): And then you would make a full Resource Plan filing in 2018-2019 timeframe?
Christopher B. Clark - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Correct.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Is that right? Okay. So kind of every two to three years.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Correct.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just go through tax reform. I think you gave a good high level overview. In the scenario in which CapEx is immediately expensed, could you talk about sort of what you might want to do in terms of increasing your rate base growth, if anything, or if that's really in your mind, not necessarily in the grand scheme, to keep along the earnings trajectory that you'd like to hit?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, that's a good question, Stephen. I do think we have to be careful that we don't try to give model specific, quantifiable, this is what we'll do and blah, blah, blah, because post 2021, I mean, I think you're going to have so many variables that – first of all, I think, as Bob said, we're in the early innings. And disruption with border tax adjustments, I mean, it just leads me to believe that if tax reform happens, we'll be talking – and we're talking about it this time next year, it will be a lot different than what we're talking about now. That said, yeah, I mean, it does create headroom, and that's a good thing. And we certainly have a lot of investment potential to invest in a grid. We have some grid investment initiatives. But you know that our approach has always been to make sure that we don't invest so much that it starts to make our prices rise more than an acceptable level. So, we've always throttled that back. And that's one of the reasons why we concentrate on steel-for-fuel, because it doesn't raise prices. If you create the headroom, then you can push the throttle down on CapEx, specifically as it relates to the grid. I will say, though, and Bob mentioned it in his remarks, that I am working with EEI and my colleague CEOs to convince federal legislators that our industry – while everybody thinks it's unique, we truly are unique, and I don't think the long-term trade of receiving bonus depreciation in exchange for non-deductibility of interest, which is a permanent difference when you get to the regulatory rate-making arena, is a good trade for customers or shareholders. Obviously, industry and Xcel would adapt. And I'm optimistic that we'd get the right kind of tax reform and the economy will grow and we'll all benefit from that. But I do think we need to be careful to try to give exact quantifications long term. I'd rather just talk about the trends that we see and what we like to see differently.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That makes perfect sense. I think it's just good to hear you talk about the ability to be able to throttle as needed. So, that makes sense. And my follow-up just is on the wind at SPS. You mentioned in your remarks the ability to potentially pursue 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts. Could you just talk a little bit more about the regulatory process for getting that approved? I wasn't completely clear on how that would unfold.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. So, we would make the proposal, I think, in the spring. Is that right, Marvin? In the spring of this year. The Commission would then take up to 12 months to actually approve it. And we've calculated that all into our construction schedules, et cetera. So, it all would be put together in time to enjoy the 100% value of the Production Tax Credits.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. So, this would be self-build. This wouldn't be a mirror image of the Minnesota approach. This would be a bit of a different approach here?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, there isn't a formalized RFP process at SPS. So, we are working with site developers and, as I mentioned, we're in late-stage discussions on how that would all work. But this would be our ownership.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hi, Chris.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Bob, I was hoping you can give us more detail on your tax comments, particularly on the administration's proposal. You said that it would be mildly accretive and that that would be primarily due to deferred tax liability, I guess, cash benefits over time for you. Could you give us kind of more detail there? Explain if that's all on the kind of corporate level of the company, and if that is basically just offsetting the increased drag from the lower tax rate itself.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Chris, I think when you take the deferred tax liability position that the company sits in today, and if you assume, just call it, an effective 40% tax rate and you cut it in half, you change that deferred tax liability. And over time, that changes your rate base as you flow those benefits back to – the cash back to the customers. And secondarily, and probably more importantly, as we continue to spend capital in that program, the deferred tax liability associated with regular maker schedules would set up on your balance sheet at a slightly different level. And so, your rate base would be slightly higher than it otherwise would be at a 40% tax rate.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So, it's all on the regulated side that you're kind of making that detailed assumption. Got it.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then, there's been kind of pretty material changes at the Colorado Commission over the past month or so. Does that, I don't know, change your filing strategy at all for this year? How can we think about kind of timing and expectations there for both the electric and the gas side?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: This is Ben. It doesn't change that strategy. We know Jeff Ackermann very well, and I think he's going to be a great Chair. Wendy Moser, she definitely knows the business. So, I think we're quite optimistic about what the new Commission looks like. We also had some changes in Minnesota, and I think those changes are going to be productive and constructive. And we look forward to working with the Minnesota Commission as well. So, I think they're positives.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And what can we expect in terms of the timing of the filings in Colorado? And then kind of the duration of the ask (37:19) there, is that going to be a multiyear for electric and then another single year for gas?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Well, the timing is, we'll file in the spring of this year, and we will be asking for a multiyear on the electric side. Marvin, what are we going to be asking on the gas side?
Marvin E. McDaniel Jr. - Xcel Energy, Inc.: We're still looking through on the gas side. It will come later on this year, probably around summer. Spring to summer of 2017.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I mean I think – I don't know if we'll get multiyear or not. I think that depends on the negotiations. We do think that these cases are set up to settle. And so, that will be the primary driver. We would also like to see the gas rates in effect before the winter heating season.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. A quick question. When do you expect to make your next Texas Transmission Cost Recovery Factor filing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. You got me stumped on that one. Anybody around the room? Marvin, you got it?
Marvin E. McDaniel Jr. - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Pardon me. I'll double check the number. I think it's in this – it's right now, frankly.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Anthony, this is Bob. I think that, after concluding our Texas rate case that was approved by the Commission, we had negotiated the ability to file the TCRF filing immediately. And you should expect to see that from us sometime this month.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And just quickly, I know your strategy is unique with the steel-for-fuel and you created headroom, but have you been seeing any pushback on rate increases in any of your jurisdictions? We're seeing possibly some pushback in California, and just want to know, in your jurisdiction, have you seen anything?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I would say, we're not seeing it now, but we certainly have saw in past years. And that's why we kind of had some of the issues we had a few years ago, as we pushed through a significant amount of capital, particularly associated with the relicensing of our nuclear plants. The bottom line is, I think it's very difficult to justify more than a 2% to 3% increase in rates. That's why we've been very cautious as we – you heard in my remarks before, we have a lot of money we can spend in the grid, and we'll go as fast as our customers and our regulators want us to go. And typically, that means a kind of an inflationary-type pace of rate increases. This is why we're so excited about steel-for-fuel, because it pays for itself. But I absolutely – but we're very mindful of that, and our capital plans respect that.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Andy.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Hey. Good morning. How are you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Just a couple questions. First, just on the SPS on the wind. Is that part of the $1.5 billion that you had in the handout?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yes. It would start to give details around that $1.5 billion. Correct.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Got it. Okay. And then just in general, the upside CapEx that you had outlined, I guess it was on the third quarter call, when you gave guidance and all that, where are we at there, as far as like the percent that has gotten down (41:03)...?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Are you talking about the – the upside I think that you're referring to would the $1.5 billion of renewables that we didn't have specifically identified projects for, Andy. Is that what you're talking about?
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: No, I think it's a total, like through 2020, I think it is, that you have like – you have your base case and then you have your upside CapEx, as you fill in over time (41:29)...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The only thing that we weren't – that we had to – we were confident in, that's why it was in the forecast, but that we had to actually solutionize, if you will, was the $1.5 billion. Everything else is pretty much identified.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Andy, it's Bob. The construct you're talking about was something we were talking about through most of 2016. When we gave new capital guidance at EE,I or on the third quarter earnings call, we rolled all the sort of upside capital from that into, what I call our base capital plan, and that's reflective of the $18.2 billion capital plan that we now talk about. So, it's all in there.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Which gets you to the high end of your growth rate, basically...?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct. I think our rate base growth rate has us 5.5% rate base growth rate over the next five years.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Okay. And then, kind of a question that I have always been asking, and if you kind of look at where the numbers are all falling out, as you said, you've filled in most of the CapEx, as far as to get to the high end of your rate base growth. I think on the cost-control side, you're probably in the early innings of being able to continue to do a good job there, whether it's reduce costs or keep costs flat; get the Minnesota rate case, which is already settled, approved, hopefully, by the end of the second quarter; and then the 750-megawatts for the Upper Midwest, probably the same timeframe. Once you get all that done and you feel more comfortable about getting those big pieces in line, is that a good time to address the growth rate of 4% to 6% and refresh it going forward?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think, Andy, every time we have significant changes, either to the upside or the downside, we're always going to take a look at what that means for our long-term growth rate and update accordingly. And so, as you get more time and more certainty, and certainly what you're talking about, it would be execution, as I mentioned, and we'll take a look at it. And we'll take a look at if there's any tailwinds that – or headwinds, rather, that might have surfaced as well. So, look for us to – we continue to review that long-term growth rate. And if it needs to change, we'll change it.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Okay. And I guess the right time would kind of be after you kind of get these final pieces in place. Is that kind of a fair way to look at it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean I'm not going to get specific on the timeframe. We just continue to look at what's happened and what we think will happen in the future.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: Okay. I appreciate that. I mean it's just interesting as we go through earnings the last couple of days, it seems, in your case, your growth rate is at least trending towards the high end, if not going higher than the high end, and you'd kind of work out the numbers that's probably higher than the high end. But we'll give you time to...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I appreciate that, Andy, because you're right, it is. And again, I think, as I've said before, our rate base growth is going to increase. But when you have things like steel-for-fuel and the pace of rate increases is modest. And that's really important we think to long-term success. And that's...
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: And I think that your cost control is helping that as well...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: ...similar to CMS. And then if you kind of look at what we've been dealing with the last couple of days, most companies are taking down their growth rates while you have the potential of raising it. So, hopefully, over time, that will get reflected in your...
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You're trailing away, Andy.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that over the last couple of days, there have been a number of companies that have been taking down their growth rate, or trending towards the bottom of their growth rate, while yours seem to be trending towards the top of your growth rate and, potentially, the ability to raise that growth rate. So, hopefully, over time, that will be reflected in your stock as far as a relative PE to the...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It sounds like you like our story, Andy. We appreciate that. We'll keep working on it for you, promise.
Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners: We do, but thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Good morning. How are you doing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just you made some comments just now about the efforts by you and other utilities to get some form of different treatment vis-à-vis others regarding tax reform. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more of a flavor as to how far along that process is. Have you been with the administration or anything, or what kind of feedback you got?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, this is Ben. Yeah, we've been working closely with, like I mentioned, other CEOs in the industry with EEI, the trade group, as you know. And so, yeah, we've had some preliminary discussions, but I would emphasize the word preliminary. I mean, this is – I think there's a long way to go with tax reform. I really do. And again, I think when we're talking about tax reform a year from now, we'll be talking about something that looks, I believe, a lot different than what's on the table now. I mean, it's just – our industry is impacted. We think there is a way to address that. We think normalization might be that pathway. But when I think of other industries, the retail industry, et cetera, there is major potential disruption. So, I'm not – I really think we'll have – I'm optimistic about tax reform, but I think it will probably look a lot different than what we're talking about today. And I do think the Senate is going to weigh in, and we've heard that.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: In what way? What do you mean the Senate's going to weigh in?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I don't think – if you read the commentary from the key members of the Senate, I think they're saying that they appreciate what the House has done, but they're going to have their own version of what tax reform should look like.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. I'm sorry. And do you have any sense as to when we're going to get – I mean, I appreciate what you're saying in terms of the disruption and just the wide variation as to what could happen. Do you have any idea when we'd get like a little bit more of a sense as to when we'll get a better idea as to sort of a narrowing of what actually is going to be put on the table? I know it's early. I'm just wondering.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I mean, it's early. I think you'll see it – you'll see the House version get passed. Then the Senate will take up what I believe will be their own version, which, my personal opinion, and based upon conversations we've had, will look a lot different than the House version. We haven't even talked about transition rules. And I think there'll definitely be transition rules because of the potential disruptive nature. So, I think Bob said in his remarks, give us a couple more quarters and let's see how things go. Things are moving fast in this administration. But I really do think this to get done, unless you try to jam it through in a budget reconciliation process, and even then I think you'd be hard-pressed to get a majority of senators voting on that. I do think this is going to take some bipartisan work. And I certainly hope it is a bipartisan product, because I think that's better for the country, in my personal opinion.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Thanks so much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CFO, Bob Frenzel, for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, thank you all for participating in our call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relation teams if you have any follow-up questions.
Operator: And that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, initiate 2017 guidance, update you on recent business and regulatory developments, and update our five-year capital forecast, financing plans and rate base growth. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share compared with $0.84 per share last year. Year-to-date, we're $0.07 per share ahead of last year and, as a result, we are narrowing our 2016 guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share from the previous range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. We still anticipate earnings in the middle of the range. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 4% to 6%. We had a productive quarter, and we continue to make progress on investment plans and regulatory initiatives. I'll briefly touch on some of the highlights. Today, we are updating our five-year capital forecast and you will notice a significant increase in renewable investments. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel-for-fuel strategy. Our service territory is unique in its concentration of renewable-rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for win generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas, and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high-capacity factors, a strong transmission network, and the extension of the production tax credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers. Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of fossil generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are lowering the emission profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer builds. A prime example of our steel-for-fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the Commission recently approved our resource plan, which includes the early retirements of two coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy. In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which would meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing, and are confident that the Commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017. We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel-for-fuel strategy. Turning to the operation side of the business, more than a decade ago we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the Upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of 156-mile Hampton-Rochester-La Crosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing four high voltage transmission lines totaling nearly 725 miles. A fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing reliability needs and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest. I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include, higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments along with sales growth and favorable weather. We also realized a lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense, largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, and higher interest and O&M expenses, which combined reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses. While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend and our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales. We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher storm costs and maintenance expense in the third quarter, and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. And we expect to carry this effort into the future. During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Consistent with our strategy to implement longer-term rate plans in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which would provide revenue certainty through 2019. Key terms for the four-year plan include an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, an annual sales true-up, a continued use of all existing riders, a four-year rate case stay-out provision, a property tax true-up and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final Commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates, subject to refund, are in place while the Commission considers the case. We're pleased to announce that we've reached a settlement and an agreement in principle in our Texas rate case and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico. Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin, where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin Commission verbally approved a combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January. Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0% to 0.5% in 2017, and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near-flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure. Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next five-year period of 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate-based growth of 5.4% using 2015 as a base. Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek wind farm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest, and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel-for-fuel strategy. Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings, so there's no impact on the customer builds. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic, financial, and operational plan. We had a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement in principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel-for-fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750-megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota. We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our five-year capital forecast, which supports continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now open the phone for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question today from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So, first quick question if I can follow-up. You talk about the 5.4% rate base. Can you elaborate a little bit on your earned ROE expectations as you start to get some clarity here between settlements across your jurisdictions into 2017 and onwards?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Are you talking about the ROEs we'll earn on the actual incremental renewable?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Where are you – basically where are you with respect to your ability to get your earned ROE up vis-à-vis what you guys had talked about at the last Analysts Day?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So, Julien, you remember when we set a goal that we were going to cut the lag that we experienced between actual and authorized by 50 basis points by 2018, and that goal is still something we're very focused on. Some things have changed, of course. Authorized ROEs have fallen a bit, as you well know. But I think that for us to continue to improve ROEs, we'd really have to cut that lag by more than half and get closer to actually earning the authorized ROEs, which is I think more realistic for us than before because of some of the settlement agreements we've entered into. So, count on us to show steady ROE improvement as we proceed down the five-year path.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Actually, can you comment real quickly on the renewal bucket of CapEx there? Just it seems if I do 19% times the new CapEx number, it might be a little bit higher than I think the couple billion you previously discussed for renewables allocated. Can you kind of walk down what's changed little bit in the CapEx specifically on that element?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, I guess just to walk you through it and we previously were at $15.2 billion, right, base cap. So, the first thing that we did was update it for the approval of Rush Creek project. All right? And then what we've done is we had placed all these, as you may recall, Julien, at NSP(Minn) for some renewable additions. We took those placeholders out and put in the actual CapEx, we believe, we'll get with the approval of at least 750 megawatts of wind. That adds another $700 million to the forecast. So, that should bring you up to about $16.7 billion and then you add $1.5 billion for more steel-for-fuel opportunities that I think we have across all of our jurisdictions. And that should, if I done the math...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: ...right, gets you close to where we are.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. So, basically, just to be clear though, there are additional undefined opportunities taken to this new plant that you anticipate disclosing or pursuing at another point in time?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. Roughly about $1.5 billion. And, Julien, I think the – we're confident that those opportunities will become reality, because, I mean, the whole premise of steel-for-fuel is you can do things on an economic basis cheaper than the fossil alternatives. So, in reality, the environmental benefits will be icing on the cake. So, when you're not impacting customer builds and you're driving environmental leadership, it's really a unique position for us to be in.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Ali.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning. Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. First, I wanted to clarify, as you mentioned, Ben, your authorized ROEs, specifically I'm thinking Minnesota, obviously, have come down, part of the settlement. So, when we run the math now and we look at your blended weighted authorized ROE with that 9.2% number for Minnesota baked in there versus what you earned over the 12-month period, what is the lag right now that you have in the overall utility system?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: The overall utility system or NSP(Minn)?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm curious for the overall, but then NSP(Minn) specifically as well.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think this year, Ali, we'll probably earn around 9%, right? And so, I think if you blended all of our authorized ROEs, it'd probably be about 9.6%, roughly around there. So you've got – so that would be 60 basis points of lag. All right? That's less than what we had before. Remember, when we first initiated, that closed the gap, it was more like 100 basis points of lag. So, I think the challenge and the opportunity for us, Ali, is to – with – for example, in Minnesota, clearly that was a compromised 9.2% is not the ROE we would prefer to have preferred to have. However, when you look at the comprehensive settlement, we have a much better shot than we've ever had before of actually earning our allowed returns. And you'll recall that in Minnesota, we had been lagging, frankly, even more than 100 basis points. So, we'll get at it differently. We've got a lower blended ROE base. But I think with multi-year plans, comprehensive multi-year plans, we can probably do better than just cut the lag in half, and that's the plan.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And then, in Minnesota strictly, where would you be ending the year running?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Say that again, Ali. You broke up.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm sorry. So, 9% you said you earned across your portfolio, but what would be the ROE earned in just NSP-Minnesota?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: For what period? This year?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: For this year. You've banked 2016 (18:36) earning what?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think it's roughly around 9% as well.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: It is 9%. Okay. So, relative to 9.2%, you're pretty much caught up there then?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think, we do – I will say that, we do have a regulatory amortization asset in 2017 that will create a bit of a headwind in Minnesota, all things equal. So, when we look at 2017, the blended utility ROE is blended for all of our ROE, so probably roughly around 9% again. But again, that amortization falls off in 2017, our cost initiatives continue to gain traction, and we continue to stay focused on two critical aspects of shareholder value, a growing rate base with our steel-for-fuel strategy and keeping our cost as low as they possibly can be as we've done over the last three years, while not sacrificing reliability and not deferring necessary maintenance.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And then second on the CapEx numbers, just wanted to clarify two things. One is, if I'm hearing you right, previously the bucket that you had put out there as growth potential CapEx, I think at that time was $2.5 billion, $1 billion was the Colorado wind, and $1.5 billion was everything else. So, if I'm hearing it right, that's all now part of the base program and you've extended it by a year. So just want to be clear, is that correct?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah, Ali, I think that's right. On the capital program – this is Bob. On the capital program, we had the base case and the upside capital that we used to disclose. And for clarity purposes, we've put it all in one sort of capital forecast. As we've talked historically about, I think we realized most of that upside case capital, and then we've put additional wind and renewable development opportunities in our forecast.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, Ali, I mean, I don't have it in front of me, but that $2.5 billion, you're right. At Rush Creek, it had like, I think, about $300 million of gas reserves. Of course, we're not going to do that now. It had some advanced grid opportunities. I believe that is associated with the North and Minnesota. And then, we had up some, I think, other renewable opportunities. So, to Bob's point, we basically have achieved the upside CapEx just with renewables. And again, the clarity we've seen with steel-for- fuel is really unique for us. And I think we'll continue to look for opportunities to transition the fleet, achieve remarkable carbon emission reductions at no additional price point to the consumer.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And so that's what I wanted to clarify, that grid modernization and some of the other buckets, are those no longer being pursued, as you mentioned it's all now renewables, or are those still out there somewhere?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No. We anticipate advanced grid in both Colorado and Minnesota. There might be some upside to this capital forecast, but basically that's been captured in the $18.4 billion that you're looking at.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Last question also – and relative to now your new rate base growth forecast of 5.4%. If I equate that to your EPS growth aspiration of 4% to 6%, it looks like you no longer need a lot of ROE improvement to get there. As long as you can sustain ROE, the rate base growth should drive you at least through the midpoint, maybe higher end of the growth forecast. Am I thinking about that correctly or how are you thinking about that now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, Ali, I think you're spot on. I think you take that growth rate. We don't need to issue equity. We have an incredibly strong balance sheet. And so, if we can see the ROE improvements, that will just drive you beyond the 5.4%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Good morning. These guys nailed most of the questions I wanted to ask, but just to be clear, looking at your CapEx forecast now versus your prior CapEx forecast, the biggest delta is renewables and that includes the plant that you've already had approved. The remaining CapEx is the assumption that you get the 750-megawatt self-build approved, or is it that you get the 750-megawatt self-build approved and then there's other placeholder CapEx for further renewables in the plan?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: To get you to the $18.4 billion, you're right about Rush Creek and Colorado, which is approved. It also assumes that we have the opportunity to build half of the RFP. We think our self-build proposals are very compelling. We could also get there through potentially build on transfer, but the assumption is that the capital associated with that RFP, half of that accrues to our shareholders and rate base. That leaves a delta of about $1.5 billion, which are opportunities that we think are spread across all of our jurisdictions. We certainly could do more than 50% in Minnesota. I think there's more opportunities to do more in Colorado. And frankly, Greg, when you look at the economic price point that we believe – that we are seeing with wind, I think we have opportunities potentially in Texas and New Mexico too just on the economic merits alone.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: So when you came up those – on the current approval on the self-build proposal, was that some sort of top-down assessment of market opportunity with the risk weighted – I mean, did you sort of start with the market opportunity and say we think this is the potential pie, this is what we can achieve on a risk-weighted basis over time or how did you come up with that number?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Okay. You broke up at the very beginning. Just asking how we derive that we can have half of the 1,500 megawatts?
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: How did you come up with the remaining $1.5 billion sort of placeholder CapEx as being a realistic expectation?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, there's almost infinity when you're saving customer's money and achieving environmental benefits at the same time. So, it's just really, I think, just an analysis of the additional opportunities, transmission constraints, operational-type considerations. When we go across all of our jurisdictions, I think it's a very realistic opportunity.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Great. Last question, what's the outside date in terms of timing for getting the approval on the self-build option in the two jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, we already have approval in Colorado. So, that's done. And then in Minnesota, we expect to have that decision, I believe, is the second quarter of 2017, correct?
Unknown Speaker: That's our goal, yeah.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. I wanted to focus on rate base growth like some of the other questions, but in particular the kind of, I think, accelerated nature of that rate base growth within a potential 2016 to 2021 plan. So, if you look at your Minnesota RFP, you have anticipated startup construction for some of those projects in the middle of 2017. And then them coming online kind of loosely before 2020. Is there a potential to, if you're successful there, do that faster? And then when you combine that with the Colorado wind project coming online in, I think, the fourth quarter of 2018 really frontload or find that some of the rate base growth is frontloaded toward the 2018 to 2019 period?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Maybe something in 2019. But, I think the practical realities of construction seasons, et cetera, probably – I mean, I think we've got our best estimate.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And secondly, on the dividend, when you look at your capital plan here, that's increased a lot since the prior one and you combine that with the fact that you don't need, I think, any equity internal or external. How do you think about your 5% to 7% dividend growth guidance that you had previously laid out?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I think it's pretty safe and pretty sustainable. I think – as you know, this was a deliberate strategy that we had. We embarked upon an aggressive – at the time, aggressive CapEx spend a decade ago, and we deliberately, during that timeframe, grew our dividend slower than our earnings growth. And that created a fortress balance sheet for us. So, now we have a modest payout ratio, 60%, 61% payout ratio. I think that's pretty low compared to our peers. It gives us a lot of what I would call dry powder. So count on the 5% to 7%. But what we would have is, if interest rates start to rise and you see kind of the industry headwinds that would come with that, we certainly could step back and work with our board and determine if there's something else we need to do. I'm not saying we're going to do that, but it's just when you have a strong balance sheet deliberately created, it creates far more opportunities to reward shareholders. And that's something we're pretty proud of, quite frankly.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just one more real quick, if I could. When you think about rolling forward your EPS growth CAGR potentially on the fourth quarter call, what kind of constraints might there be there on the regulatory front or on the Minnesota RFP front that might kind of be taken into consideration by you there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'm not quite sure -
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In terms of anything that would kind of hold you back in kind of releasing that number or caveats to the growth rate as a result of waiting for regulatory decisions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Chris, I think that guidance we provide today is going to – we expect to be consistent with fourth quarter on any roll forward in terms of capital and earnings and dividend. We don't expect that to change consistent with past practices. So, we do expect regulatory outcomes that are reasonable. We lay out of a host of assumptions that go into our 2017 guidance in our long-term earnings guidance in our earnings release today. And we expect those are good assumptions for 2017.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thank you.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good. I was wondering in terms of regulation around these renewable project or rate regulation around these. What's the current method that you expect to go forward with, i.e., is it just your traditional backward looking type of rate filings or is there a potential there to convince regulators that with these multi-billion type of investments, you could get rate riders or some kind of return on QIP, something like that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, I think what we're talking about here in Minnesota would be eligible for rider recovery. We've had those mechanisms in place for a while. So, I think recovery will be concurrent. The $1.5 billion that I talk about, that will just depend on what jurisdictions we do that in. Some will be eligible for riders, some we might propose some sort of enhanced type recovery mechanisms, as you suggest, Travis. So, I think we're in really good shape with the renewable spend in getting recovery that doesn't have lag associated with it.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. Similarly, Travis, in Colorado, the recovery of the Rush Creek wind farm is through riders as well.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And one more general question. Obviously, the fuel-for-steel (sic) [steel-for-fuel] (31:53) is a nice strategy for you guys. Is there any pushback on the regulatory front? Is there anybody saying, no, we shouldn't be doing this or we shouldn't be allowing Xcel to be doing this?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I don't know. I think people are pretty excited about it, actually. I mean, when you can show – let's talk about the Upper Midwest. When you can show regulators the plan to achieve 60% carbon reduction and do that at no incremental price points from a more traditional plant, it's pretty exciting. And, no, we haven't seen pushback at all. We've seen a lot of excitement. In fact, I expect people to say, can you do more, which is usually the way these things work. And so, no, I think it's created really good alignment with our stakeholders, quite frankly.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. How are you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: You said one of the drivers in the quarter was a lower tax rate because of higher PTCs. Is that a function of – I think the wind was a little weaker than normal last year and is more normal this year?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Paul, this is Bob. We put two wind farms into service in 2016. So, year-over-year effective tax rate is going to be lower due to the PTCs for those two farms.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: There's not – I'm not sure how the rate making works, but is there exposure to a low wind regime if you have a particularly weak quarter, or does that flow through the fuel cost?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: There's no exposure.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Hey, Angie. How are you?
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: How are you? Good morning. So, just going back to the renewables being added to the rate base versus the lack of growth in power demand. I mean, I understand that renewables look cheaper than conventional power plants. But what happens with the assets that you have on the rate base, and when there's no growth in power demand, then you keep adding generation assets?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, Angie, I think that's a really good question, but let me try to answer it this way. I think what we're really doing with wind particularly is just really buying the fuel we're going to use tomorrow on sale today. So, when you think about it, I mean, it's not that it doesn't open up the dialogue for early retirement of coal plants, but essentially what you're doing is you're displacing fossil fuels with wind. So you might still have the generation plant, the fossil generation plant, but you don't have to use it as much natural gas, even coal, when you're displacing that fuel with wind fuel. Does that make sense to you?
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: It completely does. Just my question would be more – I mean, you could buy this wind power from an outside providers that could probably use higher leverage on that project, and granted the cost of capital will be probably slightly higher than yours. But, again, the leverage ratios would be higher. So, net-net, I mean, the cost of power would probably be similar. And I know that that would be an earnings-neutral exercise for Xcel, but I'm just trying to figure out from a regulatory risk perspective, is adding renewables to the rate base in the absence of load growth is actually a low-risk growth strategy.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I mean, I think – I mean, whether it's contracted for or added through rate base, I don't think that influences very much your concern. I think maybe broader-based. I don't think our rate base self-build proposals are going to – they're going to be cost competitive. Even with the leverage that others use, of course, banking on our strong balance sheet to support that, there is an element to that. And I think our regulators are well aware of that and appreciate the benefits of utility ownership. So, I really think that when you pencil out the numbers, you see how compelling – particularly when you do it on a fully holistic basis, how compelling our proposals are.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Angie, (36:40) -
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It's also important to recognize...
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay.
Paul A. Johnson - Xcel Energy, Inc.: ...that there is – some of these wind resources are being added to reflect the fact that there are coal plants being retired in the future. So, we're just taking opportunity to capture the full PTC. So, maybe the wind comes on service a little before some of the coal retirements hit that circle. So, I think we're trying to accomplish that.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. And, Angie, I think that's a – Paul made a great point, because when we're talking about early retirement of coal plants, this is our resource plan. And we're the ones that are leading the de-carbonization of our fleet. And I think we will show that we can build wind competitively, and I think we've earned the right to own wind in our backyard, and it's all part of an overall plan. And again, I think it does require alignment with your regulators, but I think we have it.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Angie.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Zhou (37:45) with Avon Capital Advisors.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital: Hi. It's Andy Levi. How are you guys doing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy. Okay. Hey, Andy.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital: Hey. Happy to hear from you. That's always a good thing. And you guys are doing a great job as well.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: It depends on your question, Andy.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital: That's because we love you. But you guys are really doing a good job. We appreciate it. Actually, just two small questions. One is just more around the amount of debt that you plan to issue over the next several years. I guess, again, it's – the whole scheme of things it's not that important, but just why the $5 billion? Because I guess we're coming up with a little bit less like $3.5 billion that's based on your cash flows. Are deferred taxes coming down a little bit on the cash flow statement or what's – I mean, just based on the numbers that we're running, I'm just wondering why $5 billion versus like (38:40).
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Brian, do you want to answer that?
Brian J. Van Abel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Andy, this is Brian Van Abel. I think it could be part in terms of the tax (38:49) over a couple of years. When you think that we're going to start using that deferred tax asset that could be part of it. But overall, in the slide that we show, we show our cash from operations that we generate, and we have in there is consistent with our expectations.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital: Okay. We come up a little bit less but not a big deal. and then the second question for Ben. So, once you get through this final order in Minnesota, obviously, it seems that the ROEs are improving. You have tremendous amount of opportunities on the CapEx side. It seems that you – as a company, your managers have very good visibility as far as O&M costs and other operational costs, and seem to be doing a very good job there both currently and going forward. You have a growth rate out there – as you get into 2017 and 2018, what are your thoughts on the growth rate? Does it generally stay the same? Are there opportunities to potentially raise the growth rate or at least raise the bottom end of it as your ROEs improve and these projects come online?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Well, I mean, I think – Andy, as you know, I think we've got – if we can execute on both the rate base growth and the ROE improvement, we're going to be at the top of that range, maybe potentially beyond it. And that's what we're going to focus on in the next – in next year and the years to come is driving that. And we'll let things fall into place as they may.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital: Great. Thank you very much and you guys, again, are doing a great job.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: How are you? I wanted to – first of all, just on the Minnesota case, is there any possibility that people haven't come on board with the settlement could be coming on as a – is there any potential that you could wrap up the regulatory process before the schedule that you have now, if it could be accelerated at all?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's a question I ask my regulatory team all the time. I mean, there's always a possibility, but I think the reality is, because it wasn't a unanimous settlement, you've got to go through the process and we're going through that process right now. So, we'll look for those opportunities, but I mean, quite frankly, I think you should just count on the schedule that we put forward.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then with the steel-for-fuel, I'd like to just review this a little bit, a little closer. So, when you say that the steel renewables are cheaper than the fossil fuel, that includes for the renewables the production tax credits and then everything there.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: It doesn't include the cost of carbon, is that correct or does it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's correct. No, it doesn't.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And if really only the fuel component that you're talking about – piggybacking off of Angie's question that, is the fact that you're just not burning the fuel that – in and of itself that pretty much is the offset?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think the fundamental when we look at it, it's just swapping fuel for, in this case, wind fuel, okay? But what it sets up going down the road, Paul, is the dialogue that you can have and we've already made that – with that – some of that dialogue already in Minnesota about retirement of coal plants. And then you talk about how are you going to replace those coal plants. Our thought is that you do it with gas generation. You don't necessarily have to do megawatt for megawatt, and that's a function of your sales forecast. But the fuel swap alone will work, but then it sets up the dialogue about ultimately what your portfolio is going to look like.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Well...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Go ahead.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: You've already anticipated my question actually, so I don't know why you keep going there. So, I mean – so when we're thinking about this, it would sound like there may be additional benefits if there was a cost of carbon. If there is a replacement in terms of actually O&M perhaps or – I mean, any other sort of incremental things that could actually be more than just an offset, it could actually be seen, if you took other things into account, a net benefit for customers. Am I wrong?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, I think you're right. Now, cost of carbon, of course, it's an exercise outside of the pure economics, right? So...
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I mean, you're implying a societal benefit and that sort of thing, which we're not opposed to. But what we're focused on is just, it is just the straight up numbers of what we can do capturing 100% PTC with wind with fuel. And then that can allow you to have further dialogues around, as I mentioned, the earlier shutdown of coal plants, the O&M and all the other things that go with that. You start to design your portfolio to be more load following, because if you look at where we think we're going to be in 2030 and with our carbon reductions, I think we have – in the Upper Midwest we'll have 15% of our energy mix from coal. And it's – you need to make sure your generation portfolio has been designed in a way that you can accommodate these additional renewable resources without sacrificing reliability. That's all part of our planning process. I mean – so, the short answer to your question was yes.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. No, no. Thank you. And then just in terms of this steel-for-fuel, this is a – your fuel assumptions are the forward curves, is that what we should think about when you're saying that – or is there some proprietary fuel? In other words, I mean, when -
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I think that's right. That's right. And when I say we can do it cheaper, I'm also – I mean, a bit more aggressive than that. I mean, you couldn't go out today and lock in a 10-year strip cheaper than we could – on gas cheaper than we could lock in wind. And then, if you look at fuel forecast, which the blended – the forecast that you talk about, tends to have fuel escalating in the future. Quite frankly, I don't know if that's going to happen. But what we have today is so compelling that it almost – that the fuel would have to fall off quite a lot for us to say if we didn't have – it didn't actually save customers' money.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: And this is with current technology on the wind side as opposed to some – as we've seen improvements in that area, you're not banking anything on that either of these? Any potential...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: I do think – here's what we believe. We believe solar and wind will continue to fall in price, the continuous improvement we've seen. However, the PTCs, as you know, start to fall off at 20% each year after this year. And so, I think the prices we are, hopefully, going to lock in for our customers today at 100% PTC, even with the technological improvements, you will not see prices this strong again until probably the – or this low again rather until probably the mid-20s.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: That's why wind is on sale. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I wanted to – we've covered a lot of topics in Q&A. Just in terms of wind, you've had a lot of success in Colorado and Minnesota, and you've mentioned in the past some potential for further growth in wind in some of your other jurisdictions. Are there milestones, things we should be watching for, ways to sort of think about that opportunity to put a little bit more specifics around that in terms of what you might do there or is it a little bit further out? Do you need to do a lot more work before that could be realized or is this something that we should be looking for more near term?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Define near term.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, fair point. Different points of view (47:45) on that, but I'm just curious.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Stephen, I would characterize it as, if you look at the capital forecast in the earnings release, we put our best guess as to when those dollars could and would be spent. So, that's our likely – if you take into account regulatory approval and – further work, regulatory approval and construction cycle, those are our best estimates at this point.
Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. That's really all I had. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shelby Tucker with RBC Capital Markets.
Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Good morning, Shelby.
Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC: In your 2016 financing plan, it seems that now you plan to issue about $800 million of (48:32) debt in the fourth quarter. I'm guessing that's (48:35) to fund equity needs of the utilities given the higher CapEx program. How much more debt capacity do you think you have at the parent as you look to fund equity needs over the next five years?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: So, if you take into account the capital forecast that's embedded in the earnings release, you'll see our expected debt issuance is against our cash flow from operations, I think that's our best guess for what the capital plan and the financing plan looks like for the next five years.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Shelby, maybe let me – I don't want to be the CFO or the Treasurer here, so please correct me, guys. But I mean...
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: You've been both things.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: When I look at our credit metrics under this plan, they stay very strong. And so, that again, I think, speaks well to the balance sheet that we have.
Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then is there any – do any of the jurisdictions ever question you on the level of debt you take on the parent?
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: No, because it's still – Shelby, it's very modest. And as you know, we've always had the philosophy, there is a benefit of strength in numbers. You get a – if you're an operating utility and as part of a larger group, you do get a consolidation benefit, provided there isn't excessive leverage at the HoldCo, and we're not even close to that. All of our utilities benefit from being part of a bigger group. And that's always been our approach and that will continue to be our approach. We would never do anything that would be harmful to the credit ratings of our utilities. And I think our track records speaks for itself on that.
Shelby Tucker - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bob Frenzel, CFO, for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.: Thanks, everyone, for participating on our call this morning. Please contact Paul Johnson or Olga Guteneva with any follow-up questions.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 second quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2016 second quarter results, reaffirm 2016 earnings guidance range and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, flat with last year. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly ahead of last year, but a bit behind expectations, reflecting lower-than-expected sales and some unfavorable weather. However, we have taken action to reduce O&M expenses. And, as a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range of $2.12, $2.27 per share. And Bob will provide more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights. We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several of the parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues. Any settlement would still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the Commission. We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota Resource Plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the two units at our Sherco coal plant, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at Sherco and moving forward with significant wind additions in the next five years. A Commission decision is expected later this year. Now, turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliability and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures. The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers. In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather-normalized use per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. Now this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect Commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017. And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado and, in general, we had strong support for our project including the staff. The Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek subject to certain conditions including a capital cost cap, a shortened depreciation life, and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the Pawnee-Daniels transmission line. The staff also recommended granting approval of interim cost recovery through the Electric Commodity Adjustment clause or the ECA as we had requested for the project. Finally, in support of balanced disclosure, I should point out that of the nine parties that filed testimony, one intervener, the Sustainable Power Group recommended the application should be denied. But we remain on an accelerated schedule, and we expect a Commission decision in November of this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to a regulatory update. Bob.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following: electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share; and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions. Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share; higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share; and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to add renewables, and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experienced in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range. When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather-adjusted electric sales growth between 1.5% and 1%. This projection included the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year. Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe the commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely. As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 1.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. And as you come to expect from the company, with lower sales we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We've implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investments and the use of technology. On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent progress in various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Last year, we filed a multi-year plan in Minnesota which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over three years. This was based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the interveners. The finalized settlement agreement would still require Commission approval. In New Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate case settlement which will increase rates by about $23 million. The Commission is expected to rule on this settlement this month and rates would be implemented shortly after that decision. We also have a pending rate case in Texas in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. After the settlement agreement, we would expect a Commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016. Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with a Commission decision in the fourth quarter, and final rates implemented in January of next year. In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives. In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal and our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we are seeking to finalize a settlement in principle in our rate case and are moving towards a constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long term. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go first to Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. So, just as we think about the cadence of the second half, you obviously, you were $0.01 ahead in the first quarter. You were flat in the second quarter. But you need, I think, $0.08 in H2 to get into the range and presumably more to get solidly in there. So, can you talk about whether you see that coming more in Q3, Q4 or just what the kind of likely drivers are? It sounds like O&Ms might be a piece of the puzzle here, but just how we got that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it's going to be pretty balanced through the second half, Jonathan. But to answer your question, as we mentioned in the call, we have top-line revenues coming from New Mexico and the Texas cases. We are seeing some favorable weather for a change. July was a good month. And you'll recall, last year, we continued to see unfavorable weather. And I'm very confident in our ability to manage our revenue streams and our cost initiatives. So, you put all that together and that should put us solidly in the middle.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just on the Minnesota settlement, you said several parties. Does that include the DOC, can you say? And is it – are we likely to see a three-year deal or something different?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Jonathan, I'd just assume keep all the terms and the parties confidential at this point. We want to get the agreement finalized and quickly present it to the ALJ and then move forward from there. So, we'll be able to talk more freely about the terms probably in mid-August.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful, the timing. Thank you. And then, I just wanted to ask if I may – just one thing on the upside – the base and upside capital forecast. Yeah. I think the Colorado grid filing you made, it says in the release that that's largely in the base capital forecast, but then you still have that 12% of the upside CapEx is in grid modernization. So, if the Colorado piece is in the base, can you just speak to what's in the 12%?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That would be making a similar proposal on Minnesota.
Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. I was guessing that, but I think that's it. Thank you, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jonathan.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: We'll go next to Ali Agha at SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Hey. Good morning. So, from your numbers, you've told us that at the OpCo level, the earned ROE LTM was 8.89%. Can you remind us what is the authorized weighted average ROE? In other words how much of a lag would there be when we look at these numbers?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: At the OpCo level?
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, right now, our average ROE is somewhere around that upper 9s%, call it 9.8%, so that would be about 100-basis-point lag.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then also drilling into the changes here, so, you've lowered the overall electric sales roughly about 100 basis points from your original and that's $0.05, $0.06 of headwinds, if you will. So, did I hear you right that you've identified costs that will offset all of that or should we assume that the bulk of that will be offset by the cost? I wasn't clear on that.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's various drivers. Cost is a big piece, the additional revenue from Texas and New Mexico, and the fact that we are seeing some favorable weather. You put all that together and that's the offset.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. But I would imagine Texas and New Mexico would be obviously factored into your original guidance. So, the weather and the cost would be incremental is the way to think about it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right. But if you take a look at the O&M and the changes we've made in those assumptions.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And then just to get a sense, also to clarify, when you said all key revenue requirements would be part of the settlement if it gets finalized. Obviously, does that include ROE as well? Just to be clear on that, Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, yeah, ROE would be embedded in the revenue assumptions. Now, what needs to still be worked out, just for full disclosure, is some of the rate design elements, things that some jurisdictions you call phase 2, but in Minnesota are typically combined into one proceeding.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Jerimiah Booream with UBS.
Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC: I just wanted to touch upon the upside CapEx plan first. Obviously, you took out the nat gas versus last quarter on the upside plan, which I think was about $300 million. Looks like you replaced it with other. Can you provide any color around what the opportunities are there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think the big opportunities are the continued opportunities we see in renewables in our backyard. And with the extension of the PTC and the ITC, we're actively looking at how we can take advantage of those tax incentives to do even more for our customers, so more to come on that. But it's always worth remembering that we have some of the finest wind resources right in our backyard and that's from Minnesota all the way down to Texas. So, continue to look for those opportunities. That's what we call, again, steel-for-fuel opportunities. And it works so well just like Rush Creek is working so well in Colorado because you basically are buying wind at a price point less than you can lock in natural gas reserves. So, that's a pretty compelling story for customers and, I think, investors alike.
Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. And that kind of leads to my second question, so on that front in light of the IRS guidance that was given. Do you have any numbers around the potential opportunity maybe on a megawatt basis on maybe what might be rate baseable on the wind front? Or just how you might handle that going forward on repowering specifically?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: On repowering?
Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. The repowering opportunity in light of the four-year construction guidance from the IRS?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, I think most of the focus is going to be on new wind. We certainly are going to be looking at repowering opportunities too. But, I think, they're a little more one-off than the opportunities just to add the incremental wind to the system.
Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next to Chris Turnure at JPMorgan.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Ben and Bob. You talked in your prepared remarks about the Rush Creek staff recommendation being favorable and there being some amendments kind of suggested in there. Was there anything that kind of meaningfully deviated from your expectations in your request? And can you clarify what they said in regards to timing on that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't say anything was – again, it was supportive. But as I mentioned, the shortened depreciation life syncing up more closer to the transmission and service. If all of those recommendations were adopted by the Commission, I do think it would change some of the timing of the project, but that would be it.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Chris, the timing that they suggested would just delay the project going into service from 2018 until late in 2019.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Until late 2019, okay.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Correct.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And how does this project fit into any potential incremental external equity that would be needed to be raised by you guys?
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hey, Chris. It's Bob. We've said since the onset of this project that we would not raise any incremental equity associated with this project.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. And then, my only other question is on your load growth forecast kind of going into the year, it obviously is pretty weak year-to-date, and it's a little bit more on the commercial and industrial side. So, hopefully, the impact is not quite as proportionally bad as it would have been on the residential side. But kind of where did you go wrong in hindsight in your forecasting efforts? What was the main cause of that deviation?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think I'll start and I'll ask Bob to chip in where he sees fit. I think we were looking for overall a stronger GDP number, okay. And then we were also looking for more robust commodity markets. And so, when the commodity markets, as you know, have been flat, steel has been very tough, particularly with some of the currency issues internationally, so that is impacting the larger C&I customers. To your earlier commentary, the margin associated with that is not nearly the same as it would be on the residential side. We do believe, however, though, there is some trickle-down impact that may be impacting the smaller C&I customers. So, we still have some load coming on, but there has been some projects that, talking to our customers, have not materialized as we originally expected. So, does that help?
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. That was helpful. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next to Scott Senchak at Cannon (21:23).
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Hey, Scott (21:26).
Unknown Speaker: Hi, thanks. Hey. How are you? Just a question on some of the upside CapEx. If you start to execute on more of this stuff, how should we think about financing and what kind of metrics you want to be at? Would you need any equity if you hit all this stuff? Just any color on that.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Scott (21:43), it's Bob. Our expectation is if we executed on the upside capital case that we would unlikely need any equity in the program. We do watch our credit metrics closely. We've committed to keeping strong credit ratings at the operating company and the holding company, but we wouldn't expect to issue any equity in conjunction with the upside capital program.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess just – you talked a little bit about more wind in Minnesota. I'm just wondering how is the market up there? Is it able to handle more wind? Are we at a point where it's easy to add more wind? I know SPP has hit some kind of records on wind lately. And just kind of where are you in that marketplace?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, MISO is a big footprint and so, I mean, I certainly think from a reliability standpoint, from a grid standpoint, you can handle more wind, and there's going to be more wind, and it's pretty economically compelling right now. So, I'm not too worried about that. Scott (22:49), in Colorado, where we're not part of an RTO, we have experienced wind as high as I think 65% of our load in any particular time and we've managed to integrate it very well. And part of that is we've developed some of the most sophisticated wind forecasting software in the business and it's helping us be more efficient with wind. So, very little curtailments in our wind portfolio; we're pretty proud of that.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And so, that other bucket that's about 22%, I guess how should we think about if that is incremental renewables, is that something has to be done in a rate case? Or are these kind of one-off things? Or how should we think about timing of that as well?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'm looking at the 22% – hang on a second. Are you talking about on the upside cases?
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Yeah. The upside case.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, listen. I mean, remember that we have riders to cover renewable in our big jurisdictions of Minnesota and Colorado.
Unknown Speaker: Got you. So, it would still need to be approved before it was able to go in the rider? Or how would that work?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah. That's correct. You still got to get a Certificate of Public Need.
Unknown Speaker: Got you. Okay. But the numbers, at this point, you guys see is pretty compelling. Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next is Travis Miller of Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning. Thanks.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): If you look across your rate cases that are in process and any kind of other regulatory discussions you've had, what would you say are the one or two things, components that you're seeing the most pushback on? Is it ROE? Is it capital structures? Is it CapEx plans, O&M? What components are you seeing the most pushback on either from interveners or from regulators?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's not really O&M because we're not asking for a lot of O&Ms. So, it's going to be in the capital. It's usually very much aligned with our stakeholders. So, I would say, the biggest pushback is the fact that we're in a low interest rate environment now for a number of years and it is putting downward pressure on ROEs. And that's the challenge. The opportunity we have is, I think, we increasingly are sharpening our pencils and figuring out how to manage our revenue streams and keep cost consistent with where we see sales growth. So, you put all that together and, I think, we meet the challenge. And, I think, we're well positioned to meet the opportunities out there, which is finding that steel-for-fuel opportunities, finding things that are aligned, like our advanced grid initiative, with what our stakeholders want and balancing that with a really affordable proposition to our customers. And I think we've strike the right balance at the end of the day.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. You'd answered my other question, so I appreciate it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Next to John Barta at KeyBanc.
John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just to take a step back on Rush Creek, I know it has to be reasonably priced and show an economic benefit, but what's the underlying driver behind the increased renewables. Is it (26:13) RPS or what exactly?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's continuing to decarbonize our fleet with affordability in mind. And in this case, what you're doing with Rush Creek is primarily displacing fossil fuels. And so, you're lowering your carbon footprint and you're doing it at a price point that is compelling. That's a pretty winning proposition in my book.
John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on the Colorado IRP, do you have the long-term load growth assumption?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The Colorado IRP?
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: John, I think, we'd have to give – why don't you give me a call and we can get back to you on that. (26:58).
John J. Barta - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And next to Ben Budish at Jefferies.
Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. I just had a similar question on the load growth forecast post 2016. Just curious what's built into the 4% to 6% growth and kind of what kind of sensitivity there is around any deviations in the load growth?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think beyond 2016, we're looking at flat to marginal sales growth. Okay. So, that's the key question there. And embedded in the 4% to 6% is our ability to meet some of the challenges. We talked a little bit about some of the impact of ROEs that have fallen across the nation. Our ability to meet that with prudent cost control and then, capturing the great opportunities, again, that are right in our backyard, the steel-for-fuel opportunities, the de-carbonization at an affordable price point. Those are all the things that I would say that are embedded in those growth assumption.
Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just one more question. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned O&M was expected to be in line at the end of the year. Did you mean in line with the guidance of 0% to 2% or in line as in flat versus 2015?
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Sorry, the latter.
Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: In line versus 2015.
Benjamin Budish - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel, Chief Financial Officer, for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Thanks, everyone, for your attention and time today. We look forward to seeing you next quarter. If you have any questions, please follow up with Paul.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-09 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President
Analysts: Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2016 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Frenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will review our 2016 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. You may have noticed that our earnings call is a bit later than normal this quarter. We just implemented a new general ledger system, so we built a little extra time into the schedule. We're pleased to report that everything went very well with the implementation. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2015 first quarter ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which excludes a charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.30 per share. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Bob will go into more detail later, but in summary, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.46 per share last year. Overall, it was a solid quarter in which declining O&M expenses offset unfavorable weather and lower than expected sales. While electric sales in the first quarter were below expectations, we expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and we remain very confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. As we've previously discussed, we are executing on our upside capital investment plan. Later this month, we'll make a filing with the Colorado Commission to add 600 megawatts of wind generation and associated transmission. This represents a rate base investment of just over $1 billion. In April, the Commission confirmed our interpretation of a Colorado law that allows utilities to own 25% to 50% of incremental renewables without going through a competitive bid process, if the project is developed at a reasonable cost compared to similar renewable sources available in the market. The levelized cost of this wind project including transmission is projected to be below any other existing wind PPAs in the PSCo portfolio. We therefore believe we'll be able to demonstrate to the Commission and the independent evaluator that this project meets and exceeds the reasonable cost standard and represents tremendous value to our customers. We plan to request a Commission decision by November so that we can capture the full production tax credit benefit for our customers. This capital investment is currently reflected in our upside capital forecast (3:23). If the Commission approves this project, we will move it to our base capital forecast, which will result in rate base growth of 4.5%, a great example of organic and disciplined growth that provides value to shareholders, customers and the economy in our service territory. You should expect us to continue to find investment opportunities of this nature that will drive us to our upside capital goals. Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes recognizing the outstanding efforts of our employees in responding to a major snowstorm in Colorado. In March, Denver and Northern Colorado were hit with a blizzard with 12 to 18 inches of snow and wind gusts over 60 miles per hour that caused approximately 350,000 outages. As a result of proactive planning prior to the storm and the work of over 950 employees and contract crews, we were able to restore service to 90% of our customers within 12 hours, 98% of our customers within 36 hours, and 100% of our customers within 60 hours. This was another example of our world-class storm restoration, and I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and tremendous efforts to provide excellent customer service and reliability to our customers. Turning to other accomplishments, we recently received several awards that are worth mentioning. In March, the EPA and others recognized Xcel Energy with a 2016 Climate Leadership Award for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management. The award acknowledges our commitment and progress in reducing CO2 commissions (sic) emissions. Military Times ranked Xcel Energy as one of the Top Employers of Veterans in 2016. Finally, in April, AWEA named Xcel Energy the number one wind provider of energy for the 12th consecutive year. Finally, we recently announced the hiring of Bob Frenzel as our new Executive Vice President and CFO. Bob brings more than 17 years of experience in energy, banking and consulting in addition to six years of experience as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He most recently served as Senior Vice President and CFO for Luminant. Bob brings a wealth of experience that complements our strategies and our business. He understands our industry and has a proven track record of driving excellent performance and solid growth. Some of the key attributes that Bob brings to the table include strong financial and commercial acumen, excellent strategic vision and execution, an engineering and nuclear background, and an outstanding experience managing cost. He will be a valuable addition to the Xcel Energy team. I think it's important to recognize that our strategic plans and priorities are not changing. We will continue to focus on organically growing our regulated operations and maintaining the disciplined financial approach you've come to expect from us. I also want to recognize the outstanding service and contributions of Teresa Madden, who is retiring after a career spanning 36 years. Teresa played a major role in building our track record of delivering on our value proposition and she leaves a solid platform for continued strong results. We're very grateful for her many contributions and we wish her much happiness in her retirement. So I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Bob?
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Ben, for that introduction. I'm very excited to join Xcel and I'm honored to follow in Teresa's footsteps. I commit to continuing Xcel's long tradition of delivering on our financial objectives and growing earnings in a low risk, transparent and predictable manner. Now, let's get to the details of the quarter. As Ben indicated, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter as compared to $0.46 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Improved electric margins increased earnings by $0.06 per share; this was largely due to interim rates in Minnesota and capital rider revenue for recovery of capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Higher gas margins in our gas segment increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which is primarily due to rate increases from higher rate base, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which reflects cost management and some timing-related issues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting depreciation from new capital investment. Turning to our sales results, although the economy in our region remains strong and we continue to add customers, our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%. Further adjusting for the impact of an extra day of sales in the quarter due to leap year, our weather-adjusted electric sales actually declined by 1.4%. The decline in sales is largely driven by lower use per customer from energy efficiency, an increase in the number of multi-family units, the impact of distributed solar and the impact on consumption of lower oil and natural gas prices on some of our larger customers. As a result, we have lowered our full-year electric sales growth assumption to 0.5% from 0.5% to 1% range. We continue to expect positive sales growth for the full year in all jurisdictions, due to customer growth as well as planned expansion from some of our larger customers. In addition to lowering our sales assumptions, we've also taken actions to lower our full-year O&M expenses. We implemented plans early in the year to offset the impact of the rate reduction in Texas as well as unfavorable weather and lower sales growth. As a result, we now expect to limit our annual O&M expenses to 0% to 1% increase for the full year. As we continue to strive to close our ROE gap, we have been pretty active on the regulatory front. Let me provide you a quick update. There are additional details included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we recently filed a case seeking an electric rate increase of $17.4 million and a natural gas increase of $4.8 million. This is a limited scope case, and ROE and capital structure are not expected to be an issue. The decision is expected by December, with final rates effective in January of 2017. We also have pending rate cases in Minnesota and in Texas. Both cases are in the discovery stage, and as a result, there aren't any material new developments. Finally, we recently filed a settlement in our New Mexico rate case, which was reached between SPS, the staff, and other parties. The black box settlement reflects a non-fuel base rate increase of $23.5 million. The settlement represents a compromise which we think is reasonable. The New Mexico Commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year and new rates are expected to go into effect in August. As Ben mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance with no changes. However, as I previously mentioned, we have updated several of the key assumptions, including electric sales and O&M expenses as detailed in our earnings release. Also, please note that we've reduced our assumption for capital rider recovery to reflect the transfer of some pipeline recovery from the rider to base rates as part of our last Colorado natural gas rate case. The transfer has no material impact on earnings. In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Continued vigilance on cost management resulted in lower O&M expenses, which offset unfavorable weather and sluggish sales to deliver solid first quarter earnings. We made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a planned filing to own 600 megawatts of wind in Colorado. We anticipate a Commission decision later this year. Finally, we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go first to Ali Agha at SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Ali.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning, Ben. Good morning. First question, the sluggish sales growth that you alluded to in the first quarter, anything specific – I know it's early in the year and it's a small quarter, but that would give you that confidence that we're still going to end up on the positive for the year given the negative start to the first quarter?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Ali. It's really the result of conversations our account managers have had with our large commercial and industrial accounts. So we know we're going to be seeing more load come on in the second half of the year.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Okay, and you highlighted the earned ROE through the LTM ending in March 31. Can you just remind us what kind of regulatory lag that would translate into?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's about 90 basis points of lag. And again, as you know, our goal is to cut the lag by 50 basis points by 2018, and Ali, I think we remain on track with that. If you look at Colorado, I think we are on track. The Minnesota case here should put us on track and we will continue to work diligently at SPS to get that on track including filing of cases that take advantage of new legislation in forward test years in Minnesota – I mean in New Mexico.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And Ben, this Colorado wind filing, are you anticipating much opposition there or I mean is it pretty much a done deal, all you need to do is show the numbers? Can you just handicap us like how we should think about this filing and the approval?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'd never say it's a done deal. You need Commission approval, but Ali, in tune to the first part of your question, this project has tremendous community support and it's going to create tremendous value for our customers in fuel savings, even if you look at the lower gas forecast. So we're excited about it, and the community and our stakeholders are excited about it, so we're very confident this is going to go through.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay and last question, when should we start to see some of the other growth investments that you've highlighted for us start to show up in terms of filings and potential move into base CapEx?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, some of that will come through resource plans. I mean that's the big part of it – filings for grid monetization opportunities that we might be out there to capture value for our customers. So I mean I think you'll see it over the next 12 months basically.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. It's actually Julien here. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi. How are you?
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Good. Thank you. Hey. I wanted to follow up – a couple quick questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit on your eligibility to participate more than 25% to 50% in Colorado? What would the requirements there be, and elaborate a little bit more on the requirements of that 25% to 50% and what that threshold would be? And then, perhaps, a separate related question would be, the latest on solar, and specifically community solar in Colorado, and any opportunity to own or rate base those assets.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, let's start, Julien, with the 25% to 50% standard of the Colorado legislation. The 25% standard is just – is the reasonable cost standard that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The 50% standard – without going through a competitive bid, you need to show economic value to the community. And I think you asked, can you do more than that? Yeah, you potentially could do more than that. But at this point, we would anticipate you'd have to go through a competitive RFP to do that. And that doesn't mean we can't prevail on that. But that's the law that we were referring to. So we're pleased with that. Now you asked about community solar gardens. At this point, we don't have plans to buy any of those projects or provide any of those projects. It doesn't mean we couldn't, but – nothing would prevent us, but it's not something we've been actively pursuing at this point.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: The other point, Ali – or Julien, we will be making a resource plan filing later this spring and we will potentially include some solar in as part of that resource plan, so we'll go forward with that too.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And then just following a little bit on the first quarter results themselves. Obviously, little bit further from plan on the normalized, and it's always tough to read tea leaves, but what stood out if you were to go back and try to rehash things in terms of factors driving that negative delta?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Julien, you broke up a little bit. Were you asking what drove the negative sales outlook?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah or was there a specific factor more than others? I know you delineated a few there, but was there one that stood out?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean other than the factors that we mentioned, there's always the art versus science of capturing weather and the impact of weather, and we did have some significant mild weather in the quarter, so I'm not sure you can ever fully scrub that out. We follow the formulaic approach, which is blessed by our commissions, but there's always some potential for anomalies.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar Financial.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Good morning, thank you. I guess I'll continue on this demand question line here. If you think about that flat type demand, even 0.5% demand, if that continues for not just this year, but let's say the next two years to three years, how does that put you in position for closing that 50 basis point gap? Does that require more rate cases? Does it require you to change the types of requests you're making, the capital investment? Can you just walk me through kind of how that picture would play out?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it does a number of things, but we've been anticipating relatively flat sales in our outlook for quite some time now, Travis, so our ability to close the ROE gap assumes that we are not going to have robust sales to bail us out. So it means you have to manage your O&M carefully, and we are and we will continue to do that, and in fact I think we're in the early days of cost management. We will make sure our resource plans reflect those kinds of sales growth opportunities, so we don't overbuild. And of course as you know, we have decoupling mechanisms here on the electric side in Minnesota, which are helpful as well. So there's a number of things you can do from a regulatory standpoint and from an internal management standpoint, and of course from a resource planning standpoint, and that's the environment we anticipate being in.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And then just mix between residential and C&I, what's approximately your margin mix, I guess, is the simplest way to put it? When commercial and industrial is 1.5%, residential is down 1.1%, how does that translate into profitability, if you get kind of where I'm going there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Let me try to – I ask my team if they can help me with this one. I'll have a much higher profit margin in the residential, and then when you get to the C&I, it really depends on which customer you're talking about and which jurisdiction. For example, the largest industrial customer is in SPS. The sales there will have the most minimal impact on margin, if anybody can help further define that for Travis a bit.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I mean, Travis, if you think about it, the rate per megawatt hour for residential customer is probably going to be somewhere around that $0.11 range and large C&I customer is probably going to be more in that $0.07 range. So it's pretty different revenue stream.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And they pay a larger demand charge too, so variable sales tend to be more of the energy – it's more the energy pass-through than it is the high margin that you're getting with residential.
Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Yeah. Okay. Great. I appreciate the thoughts.
Operator: We're standing by. With no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Bob Frenzel for any closing or additional comments.
Robert C. Frenzel - Chief Financial Office & Executive Vice President: Thank you for participating in our earnings call this morning. I look forward to meeting many of you over the next few weeks at the Deutsche Bank and AGA conferences. If you have any questions in the interim, please contact Paul Johnson with any follow-ups.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-01-28 10:00:00) =====

Analysts: Ali Agha – SunTrust Julien Dumoulin Smith – UBS Greg Gordon – Evercore ISI Steve Fleishman – Wolfe Research Paul Freeman – Nexus Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates
Operator: Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 year-end earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions as needed. This morning, we will review our 2015 results, and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. In addition, we'll post a brief video of Teresa summarizing financial results later this morning. In addition, we recently launched an IR, Investor Relations app, so you can download for free in the app store. The app allows you to uses the mobile devices conveniently access our Investor Relations material. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn it over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning everyone. I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy delivering an ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. We also increase the dividend 6.7%, and raise the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. And this marks to 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello prudence review. In 2015, we continued to pursue multi-year compacts, which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second three-year plan in Colorado, and we followed a comprehensive multi-year plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plant advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves the liability while ensuring customer benefits and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. In 2015, we continued to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 miles to 80 miles per hour, a low zero windshield, wide out conditions and inaccessible roads to the 6 foot to 10 foot snow drifts. Now, even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. This remarkable fee was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event, and of course our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us their Emergency Recovery Award for our response to a severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers, just last summer. In 2015, our employees not only provided best in class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety, resulting in an a eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy, and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without an injury. Clearly, we believe there is a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200 megawatt Courtenay wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year-end ahead of schedule and on budget. Moving to 2016, earlier this week, the PSCO filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments and natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices, with a long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach with decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for a potential investment, assuming it is beneficial of our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made. But having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment per rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the extenders' bills. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in the rate base growth and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act or rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. This is due to multi-year plans and the existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 timeframe, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investments. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITCs favorably, as it makes large scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident and in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4% to 6% EPS growth objective. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?
Teresa Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. My comments today will focus on full year 2015 results. We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes, allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings; electric rate increases in riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado, and reduce O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share, compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather condition. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense, as well as lower AFUDC. Turning to sales, our weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sales. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers, but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.002 in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team refunded by reducing costs to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitments depending the cost curve, and meeting our financial objective. Now, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the Commission rules in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while a written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results. We wanted to give you a high level overview of the verbal decision. The Commission largely approved the ALJ recommended decisions with a couple of changes. Key decisions include a single year rate plan versus our request for a multi-year plan, a three year extension of the PSIA prior, and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have signed fully analyzed the results. In our Texas electric rate case, the Commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million, compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. The Commission decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include rejection as SPS's request for post test-year capital addition. This allow us of SPS's proposed known and measureable adjustment for updated allocation factor between customer classes related to low reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015. This allowance of incentive compensation and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the earned ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed [indiscernible] hearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions at the recently passed legislation designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for a inclusion of post-test year capital additions, timelier implementation of the new rates, and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investments. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcomes in the upcoming case. In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission approved the decision on our proposed 2017 interim rates and indicated NSP Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure schedule has been established which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we had outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the timeline to reach the resolution in the case. Next, I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed five-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated five-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate case CAGR by approximately 70 basis points to 80 basis points resulting in the rate base growth of about 3.7% for our base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate-based growth, it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investments. At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan, distribution grid modernization and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunities. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming fruition over the next five years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the five year of timeframe results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5% including the impact of bonus deprecation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year, we increased our dividend for the 12th straight year, we initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses, new legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory risk, we resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. Finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha: Good morning, Ben, Teresa. As you mentioned in 2015 on an ongoing basis, the OpCo, are we weather normalized 9.07%. Can you just remind us what the weighted average authorized ROE is just to get a sense of what is the lag as we've exited 2015? And then what's baked into earned ROE in your 2016 guidance?
Teresa Madden: Well, we'll start with the weighted average, in terms of authorized ROEs, it's about 9.8%. And when we look to 2016, we see three of our utilities earning right around the 9%, low 9% and some of them little stronger than that. I will say we have some lag in Texas, our Texas or the SD company, somewhat related to – what came out of that case. But you know we're filing a new case. And so, we do still see – think we're on target to achieve our 50-basis point closure by 2018, Ali.
Ali Agha: Yeah. But in general though, is 2016 earned ROE on average similar to 2015, when you put it altogether?
Teresa Madden: And we would expect to see some improvement in it.
Ali Agha: Okay. And then separately just for 2016, as you mentioned the Texas case was disappointing, looks like Colorado guess if they followed the ALJ to the large extent seem to below, what should been asking for. What kind of headwinds does that create for us for 2016? And at this point, is that put us more in the lower half of the range, or how should we be thinking about the implications?
Teresa Madden: I mean, Ali, we were pretty pragmatic when it comes to handicapping, what we put out on the forecast. So, I don't – it doesn't have much of an impact at all.
Ali Agha: Okay. And last question, when at the earliest should we start to see some of the growth CapEx and rate base implications start to move into your current base case plans?
Teresa Madden: Ali, we filed the energy – we're going to file a resource plan later in the year in Colorado and that's where you'll start to see the energy future plans, but I mean they will probably be most eminent – probably be in the backend of our capital forecast. But Ali, let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first three years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first three years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years, four and five, and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the extender's pillars. I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think gives us upside to exceed our GAAP closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more portable customer bills, I think that plays well to our multi-year plan discussions here in Minnesota. But then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of the renewables that are now been made so much more portable by the ITC and PTC extension. I think, we're being conservative, but I think we can capture with creditability that capital upside. I mean there is a lot of renewables they're going to built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large scale renewables on mine, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable. And we're really – we're excited about it and I think – I think it's going to – it's done a lot for us. And so, I guess you know, we would have first, I think the first utility to talk about the impacts of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us, and I'm really confident in our plans.
Ali Agha: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Julien.
Teresa Madden: Hi, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, guys. Well actually let's kick it off just going back to that last question a little bit. Just kind of definitively in terms of timing there for the growth CapEx. Is there kind of a year in which you would frame this, I mean – perhaps let me frame it this way NOLs obviously in the near-term limit you might be impact the bonus depreciation. Do you need a wait for the cash tax benefit extend hours within in the five-year period or how are you thinking about the timing of that growth CapEx, given the cash tax position?
Benjamin Fowke: I'm Julian, and in terms of – we don't think that this is dependent on the cash tax position by any means, and we do think the CapEx probably would start in the middle of, I would say, the 2018 timeframe, so -e and we think we'll be well positioned. We have some time to – because of the NOL situation and the multi-year has been described. So we think that we have a lot of opportunity and that's probably when it would start.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And just to be clear, if I hear you right, it would also be dependent upon getting approvals in specifically in Colorado?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, yeah, I mean it's...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: The upside CapEx.
Benjamin Fowke: I mean, well, it's not only in Colorado, I mean it's also in Minnesota. And then remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day. And what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado Energy plan have updated that capital forecast, because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation, and we should and I'm confident that you're going to see more renewable, because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. And in fact, if you think about, the PTC is – it does face down quicker than the ITC. So if you were staging it, you'd probably focus on more wind initially. And you know, you don't – you've got to look at the NOLs too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level, specifically then it rolls up to the Holdco. I think what you're referring to Julian is maybe some – you know, if you don't have a tax appetite, some of those things get – put on the balance sheet for a period of time, and they do. But that's okay. I mean, it turns around and we're very much prepared to wait for that turnaround, because these opportunities I think are extremely compelling, realistic and they're right in front of us, and they are in our backyard and it's organic growth.
Teresa Madden: Maybe just to supplement that in terms of your question about the regulatory process and if you just – just related to Minnesota. When we went through the last resource planning process of the four wind farms, I mean we're owning three of those for wind farm, so we think they are very supportive. In terms of ownership in Minnesota, and Colorado more to come, but we're very confident.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. Great Teresa.
Teresa Madden: And actually just to get a little clarity on the renewable spend, are you feeling confident about your ability to continue to own solar rate base projects, as you proposed back of the [indiscernible]?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah. I mean again I think these things are affordable and we always pursue things with the impact on the consumer. And even with low natural gas prices, what we're seeing with wind and now with the extension of PTC says, a) it's a good deal for consumers. Same with solar, I mean, as you know, large scale solar is a better deal for all customers than as rooftop, but – and I think there is an appetite for that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But even relative to PPA option.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, a PPA in my mind, drilling is kind of like the decision between whether you own a car or lease a car, right. And typically, you can [indiscernible] the PPAs, so it's the cost of ownerships lower in the early years, but as that lease expires and then you got to re-up it and it becomes more expensive. So, when you do a total revenue requirements over the expected life of the asset, it's typically more beneficial to own the asset. And I think our commissions recognize that and I think they incur – are supportive to Teresa's point of us owning more renewables.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Greg.
Teresa Madden: Hey.
Greg Gordon: Hey, good morning. All my questions have been asked. Just getting a little bit more into the [indiscernible] of how bonus impacts you. Can you repeat what your – what's your authorized return is in your electric deal in Colorado and how much regulatory lag you're currently experiencing there?
Teresa Madden: Our overall authorized return in Colorado is 983 and remember we have the band of about 65 basis points. Up to this point, we have been and through 2015, we have been in a refund position, but we will be entering our second year of the three year and we do think there's some headroom there. So, anyway, that's where we're at.
Greg Gordon: Okay. So, in that – in Colorado in particular, bonus depreciation would – wouldn't necessarily – would only hurt you if it puts you into a refund position vis-à-vis having a lower rate base number, right?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, it's – I don't – I don't think that's really entirely true, Greg, because we've been in a refund position. As Teresa mentioned, we just entered our second three year approach, our plan and that plan required us to do some work to earn that ROE and bonus depreciation on the multi-year will help us earn that authorized ROE more readily. And then of course...
Greg Gordon: No, that's exactly my – that's exactly my point. That it's not necessarily going to hurt you, if you were...
Benjamin Fowke: Oh, I thought, you said it was [indiscernible] I'm sorry I miss heard you right.
Teresa Madden: I miss heard you too. So yeah, exactly.
Greg Gordon: Okay.
Benjamin Fowke: In that view, it's tougher to get to the – into a sharing position now, because the plan is a little more difficult, because you've got more spending. So, it only puts you back into a refund position, if you over earn, which is less likely under this plan. And therefore, you might not have as intangible impact in Colorado, as it wouldn't necessarily in Minnesota, where you're – whatever the new rate plans are going to be, it'll be in there, right.
Teresa Madden: Yeah. So said in another way. We think it makes – the bonus appreciation in Colorado makes it easier for us to achieve our valve ROEs in Colorado. In Minnesota, you have an – you're in an NOL position for the next few years. And then years four and five, you start to come out of that, and Grey, what that says to me is, I think it makes the five year multi-plan even more attractive today, than it was prior to that extension. And so, we'll see where that goes. But I mean, it's – again, that's why we think, this gives us a positive versus a negative.
Greg Gordon: Yeah. All right. Thanks and good luck in the Super Bowl.
Teresa Madden: Thanks Greg.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, go brought some, where do you brought that up Greg, and I'm sorry about your New York Jeff.
Operator: And the next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steve Fleishman: Yeah, hi. Good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Good morning.
Steve Fleishman: Good morning. So the $900 million for the – I think, that's for the Colorado that you added. Can you give us maybe a little thought on what you're assuming in there, in terms of 2,000 megawatt, is it mainly for the 1,000 megawatts of wind or you assuming like you win half of it or how are you getting to that?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes. You got it and you take...
Steve Fleishman: Okay.
Benjamin Fowke: ...entire spend of the 1,000 megawatts, which I think is 600 wind, 400 solar. And we assume we get a half of it.
Teresa Madden: That's exactly right. Yep.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. That's easy enough. Second question is just and an apologize to beat this that horse to Paul, but I know you're talk about the benefits after 18 of the kind of the bonus and rate headroom and all those things, but just to make sure understand, if the NOL benefit is gone then the bonus impact is actually bigger out test 2018? So obviously, you have more rate headroom, but it also impacts rate base more. Or if I'm not right.
Teresa Madden: Yes.
Benjamin Fowke: Well. I mean, I think that's – go ahead, Teresa.
Teresa Madden: No. I mean I think you're right. I mean in terms of as we tailor down, I mean in the latter part, but that I mean two things and I think Ben described it, since we're in the NOL and we're going to be in the NOL and Minnesota for the first couple of years, we have time to work through some of these things and we have opportunity potentially for investments, upside investments which we've talked about in terms of our resources.
Steve Fleishman: Right.
Teresa Madden: With modernization you talked about that at the Analyst Day. So yeah, we think...
Steve Fleishman: Then you have the – so you're right. Obviously you're point is that you've got line of site on project opportunities and then it fits well within your rate headroom kind of limitations and all that stuff to fill that in do things that you want to do, so okay.
Teresa Madden: Yeah. I think that's exactly right. And it goes beyond 2018, frankly beyond 2020 you just look at what we're doing here in Minnesota. There's a tremendous amount of renewables, grid modernization, there's a lot of work that to be done and Steve I think the limiter has always been what are -- what is the pace of rate increases. And so, we have always had more capital opportunities than we've executed on, because we're mindful of what happens when you – you are in front of the regulator asking for more than a modest rate increase. So I think this actually is very, very much facilitates our strategic plans and keeps that affordability equation where it needs to be. So, that's why we think it's positive.
Benjamin Fowke: Exactly.
Steve Fleishman: Okay. And then on the Minnesota rate case, could you maybe just give a little more color on how likely you see chances for settling that, given I know there are lot of involvement in getting the legislation done to begin with it.
Benjamin Fowke: What's the begin – it always takes two to settle, right. I mean so and we do had time scheduled over the summer for that. I think that's a good sign. I think that if you look at the case, it's about a straight forward issue you can get. So, you know I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get something done. It would make sense to get something done, and got Marvin McDaniel, Chris Clark if you want to add anything to that, you're on the front lines.
Teresa Madden: That is to [indiscernible] I think you're right. I think we have a great opportunity and we look forward to working with parties to see what we can accomplish.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, you said you agree with it.
Teresa Madden: I agree with you [Inaudible].
Steve Fleishman: Okay. Last question just on I know you talked about the investment opportunities potentially in gas reserves. We're seeing more and more comp – electric utilities also invested in gas, midstream assets. I'm wondering if you're seeing anything in there as well that might fit?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, Steven, I think for us – when I think of midstream, I think of pipeline type assets, ideally PERC regulated and not so much gathering and processing and only that fits in our risk profile. So, I think for us the thing to do is twofold, one, there is anticipated to be a lot of shake out the current oil and gas prices remain and maybe that will create some opportunities for us at reasonable cost, reasonable cost being underscored out there. And we'll also continuing to look for organic type – pipeline type growth opportunities in our own regions in part due to the clean power plant and the need for more gas redundancy. But don't look for us to jump into what I would – I think you would consider classic midstream assets. I'd also tell you, as when I mentioned on the call that while we're interested in get rate base in gas reserves, in today's very low natural gas environment, it's difficult to find those opportunities that makes sense from a consumer standpoint. But our thought is, as you know, things cycle, commodity prices change and you got to have a framework in place, so you can execute on it quickly opportunistically, and that's what we're seeking to accomplish initially in Colorado.
Steve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Freeman with Nexus.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Paul.
Paul Freeman: Thanks. How are you? And I guess I'm a little – still a little confused sort of on the first three years, because you're showing about $600 million of less rate base in your base case, and the tax position, would have been the same either way, in terms of whether you're not paying taxes, because of bonus or not paying taxes, because of the NOL. You're essentially in the same position of not paying tax. So, is – if you could just help explain the offset to the lower rate base, and the tax position sort of being the same. Is it because, you're taking stretch spending and moving it forward. And that's what's offsetting the lower rate base or is there something I'm missing?
Teresa Madden: No, it's – Teresa, you correct me, if I'm wrong.
Paul Freeman: Sure.
Teresa Madden: In public service Colorado, we're in a three year plan. So to the extent, you see rate base reductions, which we do, you've got a fixed revenue stream, and you're earning on a lower rate base. So, your earnings doesn't change, but the base that you're earning on it does. In Minnesota, and again, you have to look at where, you have to look at each operating utility in addition to where we are on a consolidated basis. And in Minnesota at NSP, you've got, they have an NOL position, that is for the next few years is parked on the balance sheet. So we are earning on that. And then, when it starts to roll off, it reduces your – the amount of revenue requirements you need. So that's basically, why it doesn't have an impact on us in the first three years. Does that make sense?
Paul Freeman: Thanks, sir. Yes.
Teresa Madden: Yeah, I think you answered it fine.
Operator: And the next question will come from Gale Muse [ph] with Aviva Investors.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you.
Teresa Madden: Hi, Gale.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello. Good afternoon. I'm calling from the [indiscernible] Investors, the asset management at the UK insurance company We focus on materially short and long-term risks, facing investee companies. And you know policy at action associated to controlling climate change is already underway such as the Clean Air Act. And if you, and following the global agreement in Paris, the climate change, we were wondering what additional step, Xcel Energy was taking to ensure the business is resilient to this cause and constrain global outlook.
Teresa Madden: Well, that's a great question Gale, and I appreciate that, and I think if you – when you get more familiar with Xcel Energy, you seem not only have we been an environmental leader for more than a decade and have reduced our carbon emissions in addition to many other emissions, but our carbon emissions specifically by more than 20% of our 2005 baseline we'll reduce them by 30% by 2030, but we're going to be on that. As a leader on renewables, leader in converting aging coal plants and natural gas. If you take a look at what we're doing right here in the upper mid west with our plan, we'll have reduced carbon emissions by 2030 by 60%. That will exceed the Clean Power Plan targets. So, we recognized what you're talking about and what we believe, as it can be done, but you need to do it pragmatically and with affordability and reliability in line and when you have a long-term plan under a good policy framework, you can accomplish that. So, thank you for your question, and look forward some good things from Xcel Energy.
Operator: And the final question will come from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson: Good morning. How are you?
Benjamin Fowke: Hey Paul.
Teresa Madden: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Just you've been over it, and I apologize I wasn't quick enough. You went over the sales growth forecast, I think with 50 basis points and was that right that included leap year...
Teresa Madden: Yes.
Paul Patterson: ...or exclude? It did include leap year. And what were the other things that we're driving it as well?
Teresa Madden: Well, let me start with, yeah, our guidance is 0.5% of 1%. The leap year is 0.3% and we are seeing customer growth of about 1% across our system. And we are seeing – if we look at the last two quarters, well, on the annual basis in terms of use per customers particularly in our residential class, we are showing a decline in our larger jurisdictions. The last two quarters, we have actually seen that plateau. And so, we don't expect to see this continue. I mean two quarters is not necessarily a trend, but we do expect that to levelize. So, we are expecting to see some improvement. And then, specifically to some of our large C&Is where we do see some decline, we see that's going forward that we don't expect that to continue. We see some stabilization with where they will be at in 2016 as well.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Most of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much.
Teresa Madden: All right. Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Teresa Madden for any additional or closing remarks.
Teresa Madden: Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions, and thanks very much.
Benjamin Fowke: And go Bronco.
Teresa Madden: Go Bronco. Yeah.
Benjamin Fowke: Thanks everyone. Bye-bye.
Teresa Madden: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Teresa Madden: Thanks.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions. This morning, we will update you on recent regulatory and business developments, review our 2015 third quarter results, discuss our 2015 and 2016 earnings guidance range. In addition, there are slides that accompany today's call that are available on our webpage. We'll also post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing financial results. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported earnings of $0.84 for the quarter, which was $0.11 per share higher than last year. With nine months of the year completed, we're very confident in our ability to hit our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance and are narrowing the range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. We're also initiating 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. As we previously discussed, legislation was passed this year in Minnesota that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to five years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid modernization. Earlier in September, I had the opportunity to discuss with the Minnesota Commission and other stakeholders our vision of the future for the utility industry. The vision I outlined included adding cost-effective renewables to our system, adopting new technology like battery storage, modernizing our distribution grid, making it more resilient and ready for two-way energy flows, becoming more consumer-centric and offering additional products, options and services that our customers want, changing our fleet to position us for the future, address the Clean Power Plan and significantly reduce carbon emissions. I also discussed the recently-passed legislation that gives us a new set of tools to use as we look to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future, while providing significant benefit for consumers, investors and policy makers. Multi-year plan provides greater certainty and transparency for both the company and our customers. It also provides a longer runway to transform our cost structure and allows us to address significant energy policy issues, which can be difficult to do when you're in a litigated rate case proceeding. Overall, I appreciated the opportunity and thought the meeting went well. Consistent with our vision of the future, we recently filed an update to our Minnesota Resource Plan. The proposed plan now achieves a 60% carbon reduction for the NSP System by 2030 and includes the following key components: the retirement of Sherco Unit 2 in 2023, Sherco Unit 1 in 2026; the addition of 800 megawatts of wind and 400 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2016 and 2020; the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and 1,000 megawatts of large-scale solar between 2020 and 2030; and finally, the addition of a 230-megawatt combustion turbine unit in North Dakota and a 780-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Sherco site in the mid-2020s. While this is an exciting plan that has widespread stakeholder support, it also is a continuation of our proactive environmental leadership strategy, which leaves us well positioned to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. And I believe this plan will create ownership opportunities for Xcel Energy as well. The recently-passed legislation, our proactive resource plan filing and our plans to file a multi-year rate plan in Minnesota are all part of our strategy to streamline the regulatory process so we can focus on longer-term energy policy issues. In early November, we plan to file a rate case in Minnesota. The rate case is driven by capital investment and will incorporate key provisions of the legislation into the filing. While we won't discuss the specifics of the request prior to the filing, I do want to provide you with the overall framework of the case. We are filing a three-year multi-year rate plan. We're also providing an option to extend that three-year plan to five years. In addition, we will be requesting interim rates for both 2016 and 2017. While the case could take over a year to complete, we are going to see if we can see if we can settle the case or offer mediation to shorten the timeframe to reach a final decision. I believe the combination of the legislation, the resource plan filing, stakeholder outreach and the optionality of the multi-year plan fling put us in excellent position to achieve a constructive outcome in the Minnesota rate case. So now, let me focus on investment opportunities. We've previously discussed our plans to step into the development of the Courtenay Wind project. During the quarter, we received approvals from both the Minnesota and the North Dakota Commission. As a result, we're moving forward with the project, which will now be included in rate base versus a PPA, which was the original plan. Now, this an example of our Steel for Fuel strategy where we take a pass-through cost, move it into rate base and cause a minimal, if no impact to the customer bill. Next, let me give you a quick update on our efforts to rate base natural gas reserves. In August and September, the Colorado Commission held informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. The meetings were very helpful and informative. We plan to submit a regulatory filing before year-end that will establish a formal framework and incorporate feedback from the meetings. Following the Commission's decision on the preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. Finally, this week SPS is filing to transfer about $100 million of transmission facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma from SPS to one of our Transcos. SPS no longer provides retail electric service in Kansas and Oklahoma. So, this is a good opportunity to seed one of our Transcos with some assets. SPS will make various regulatory filings at both the state and federal levels and final approval is expected to take about a year. So, you can see it's been an exciting and successful quarter. I will now turn the call over to Teresa, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the third quarter of $0.84 per share, which compares with $0.73 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.14 per share and was largely due to new rates and higher rider revenues driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. The incremental revenue also reflects the impact of favorable weather. Offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, lower AFUDC earnings, higher property taxes and higher interest expense. Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down 0.2%, driven primarily by lower residential use per customer, partially offset by customer growth. We continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 3.6% compared to a national rate of 5.1%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. We have adjusted our electric sales assumption and now anticipate flat sales growth for 2015, reflecting our year-to-date results. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a longer-term trend. It is important to note that in 2016 we will be implementing decoupling for the residential and small C&I customer classes in Minnesota, which should address any declining customer usage trend. Next, I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado, we have a pending natural gas rate case and we are waiting for an ALJ recommendation, which we should receive shortly. The Commission is expected to rule in January 2016. As a reminder, interim rates were implemented in October. In New Mexico, we re-filed our electric rate case, which seeks an increase of $45.4 million based on an ROE of 10.25%, an equity ratio of about 54% and a historical test year adjusted for known and measurable changes. A Commission decision and implementation of final rate is anticipated in 2016. Finally, in our Texas electric rate case, in mid-October, we received the ALJ recommendations, which reflected a $1 million rate increase and compares to our requested increase of $42 million. The ALJ's recommendation was based on an ROE of 9.7% and an equity ratio of almost 54%. We reviewed the recommendations and believe there were errors in the filing and, therefore, sent a letter to notify the Texas Commission of our concerns. Late yesterday, the Texas staff revised the recommended rate increase to $14.4 million. Please note that due to the timing of this update, our earnings release does not reflect this revised revenue recommendation. In addition, we have not had a chance to analyze this subsequent filing. The ALJ's recommendations are somewhat mixed. We've prevailed on a number of key items such as cost allocation issues that, if supported by the Commission, will establish solid precedent and should eliminate these disputes in future proceedings. Unfortunately, the ALJ's recommendations did not vary from the historic test-year precedent and rejected our forward-looking adjustments for post-test year planned additions planned additions and FPP cost, which represented a significant portion of our request. We believe these adjustments relate to policy decisions about the best way to alleviate regulatory lag, which needs to be addressed by the Commission. While the Commission isn't required to implement provisions of the recently-passed legislation in this case, we remain hopeful that the Commission will be more open to addressing regulatory lag, taking into consideration the intent of the legislation in making its final decision in this case. The Commission is expected to rule by year-end with new rates effective by January 2016. In our earnings release today, we also announced that we will start using market share purchase to fund our dividend, reinvestment and benefit programs in 2016. This will eliminate an annual equity issuance of about $75 million and reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and projected cash flows. This morning we are narrowing our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.05 to $2.15 per share. Previously, the range was $2.00 to $2.15 per share. We are also initiating our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS 4% to 6% annually. Please note our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. I would also like to mention that we will be hosting an Analyst Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 3. At the meeting, we plan to update you on our plans to achieve our 50 basis point in earned ROE, our regulatory plans, our plans to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, our five-year capital forecast including potential incremental investment opportunities. And finally, we will update our rate base growth estimates and financing plans. With that, I will wrap up my comments. We had an excellent quarter and are on track to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We are on track to deliver O&M consistent with our zero to 2% objective. We initiated 2016 earnings guidance, which is in line with our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate objective. We filed our revised resource plan in Minnesota, which is designed to reduce carbon on the NSP System by 60% by 2030. We have received all regulatory approvals for the Courtenay Wind project. We completed the Commission informational meeting on the rate basing of natural gas reserves in Colorado. We've made progress on several regulatory dockets and intend to file our Minnesota multi-year rate case next week. Finally, we eliminated all equity issuances from our forecast beginning in 2016. So, operator, with that, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Of course. And we'll take our first question from Ali Agha at SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Ali.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. On Slide 10, where you give us your 12 month – or last 12-month ongoing ROE, which has the total OpCo at 9.02%, can you just remind us what is the weighted average authorized to compare it to, just to get a sense of how much lag there is on this last 12-month basis?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ali, I mean, on average, we utilize like – our proxy is about 9.8%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 9.8%. Okay. And Teresa, also in the 2016 guidance, what's the embedded earned ROE that you've budgeted there?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of the regulated companies it's just north of 9%, about 9.1%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, you're not assuming much improvement between 2015 and 2016?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, remember, we have some weather embedded in 2015 and other things. So, we've taken those out of our 2016 guidance.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Because I thought year-to-date weather was like a negative penny from your disclosures. It was just normal. I didn't think it was a big factor.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It is a small factor. But we've taken that out.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, Ali, I mean you – I think what you're getting to is the 2018 goal of reducing lag by 50 basis points, because we typically have 100 basis points of lag. And we're going to make improvement in 2016. We're very confident. Clearly, we have to execute on our regulatory plans and our cost control. But we're confident we're going to do that. And I mean you should be confident that we're going to meet that goal by 2018 and we'll show incremental improvement in 2016, 2017, and then meet it by 2018.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So Ben, just to be clear, I mean if through the September quarter, you're at 9.02%, is that a good proxy of where you're going to end calendar 2015 as well given that your big quarters are now behind you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not quite sure I can answer that question, Ali. I will tell you that we narrowed the guidance range. You probably can do the math. And I think there's symmetry, so as there is with the 2016 guidance. So, I mean, I think it's pretty transparent where we're going.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, the load growth trends as we look at how the year-to-date numbers are going and now we're assuming flat load growth this year. What's the visibility or confidence that you can move up to 0.5% to 1% growth next year? What's sort of changing? What do you expect to change to see that pick up?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the first thing I would remind you, Ali, is that we have less sensitivity as far as earnings goes with the decoupling mechanism that we've put in place starting in 2016 in Minnesota. So, keep that in mind. We are still seeing good customer growth, about 1%. So, that's a good thing, particularly when you combine it with the decoupling mechanism. What is it? Teresa, I think the third quarter was a bit better?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was better. I mean, the second quarter is where we actually saw the greatest decline in this year. And so, we actually were positive in terms of our electric growth in the third quarter.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Last question, coming back to the gas reserve process, what's you sense, when – do you think that the Commission will have formalized their plans by the end of the first half that would allow you to come in, in the second half? Recent meetings I've had with some of the Colorado Commission suggests that they may take up to a year to figure out what their plan is, so by end of 2016 as opposed to earlier than that. Just curious what your thoughts are on when that is firmed up?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, it could take longer, Ali, but we're going to make our filing. And then, I think we certainly don't want to see market opportunities slip away. And I think everybody realizes it's a pretty good time to do these investments. So, I think the compelling economic arguments will drive us to be able to be in a position to move forward as we've outlined.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Travis Miller at Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Good morning. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was looking at slide 18. First question here, the slide 18 where you have the ROE sensitivities, could you walk real quickly through which of those have the opportunity, I guess, to realize those changes in the next year or two? Obviously, Minnesota Electric, I would assume, you'd have an ROE proposal there. What other jurisdictions there would have the opportunity to go plus or minus on that ROE?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I mean, obviously, Minnesota. I mean, in terms of Colorado, in terms of how we come out, we do have our three-year plan. So, we will actively manage that. We have several rate cases that are proceeding or coming to closure so there could be some opportunity with those as well.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Is there anything beyond this kind of a 2016-2017 range where you think there could be opportunities there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You know, Travis, I think, I mean, this is just a sensitivity graph, and just showing you the impact of 100 basis points change. I think really – I mean, if we – as you know, we typically have been under earning 100 basis points. And if we – we're still online, right, Travis?
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sorry, we just had a screen go blank here. So, if can't improve that position, we're going to be at the low end of our CAGR EPS growth rate. If we achieve our goal, we're going to be in the middle to upper end. And if we can close that gap completely, and what I think this chart is trying to show you, then we would actually exceed our CAGR growth rates. So, what's going to be the big driver on that? Well, obviously, Minnesota is going to drive a lot of it. And this five-year or three-year, whatever we end up with, is going to be a big driver in where we are. But there's other places. Colorado, we've been over-earning so the multi-year plans have worked for both investor and consumer alike. And then, the unknown is Texas. We can continue to improve that regulatory compact, take advantage of the new legislation. Continue to move the regulatory compact, combine that with the transmission riders we have, that'll push it all up in the upper end. So, it's getting better – it's getting better alignment with our regulators, combining that with cost control. We don't need to issue equity, and that's great. And I think we've got a robust CapEx pipeline. So, I don't want you to get too caught up on this chart here, because that really is just to show you just numerically what 100 basis points movement does.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, conceptually here, with the Clean Power Plan, the resource plan and Minnesota potential rate case over a three- or five-year period, what are thoughts generally on customer rate impact, if you were to get to that type of goal, that kind of 60% of clean energy type of level?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Travis. I've got to tell you that's a great question, because it's something we really focus on, because I mean you – rate base growth is great. And that's why we're focused on Fuel for Steel or Steel for Fuel, whatever – whichever way you like it. It's basically – the good thing about it is it doesn't impact the customers very much. So, to specifically answer your question, obviously, when you look at 2030 or through 2030, it's going depend upon what set of assumptions you buy into. I think we're in an environment where gas prices are going to be pretty stable. I think we're in an environment where renewables are going to continue to fall, even if they're not as supported robustly with – at the federal level with ITC and PTC. So, really, when I look at it, I think that meeting this – exceeding the Clean Power Plan, reducing our emissions by 60% here in the Upper Midwest, can be done over a cumulative 15-year period with no more than perhaps a 2% cumulative increase over that timeframe, so negligible. Right? And so, the real issue is going to be, can we build out infrastructure, can we do these other things and not have that pace exceed customer affordability. And I think the answer to that is, yes, we can. Getting into multi-year compacts is the way you do. Cost control is the way you do that. Discipline about your capital investments is the way you do that. And we're spending a lot of time on that, and I'm very confident this plan is going to be affordable.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the thoughts.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Travis, I'd just say, all you have to do is look at some of the wind assets and other assets we're bringing on there. They're right on parity with fossil. And I think they will be too even with the expiration of tax credits.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Great.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Turnure at JPMorgan.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. You recently increased your dividend growth guidance to 5% to 7% and you established that payout target of 60% to 70%. I just wanted to get a sense going forward, you eliminated the DRIP in 2016 and beyond, I guess. And in the event that there's less opportunities to deploy your capital, how do you think about the trade-off between kind of increasing the dividend more, upping that payout ratio to the higher end of the 60% to 70% range versus maybe buying back debt or deleveraging?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me just say it's nice to have a lot options and that's what we've created for the investor, I believe. I'd take a little bit of – I'll argue a little bit, I think we've got a pretty robust capital forecast ahead of us and I'm very optimistic beyond the five-year plan we'll continue to have that pipeline as we implement Clean Power Plans and other things across all of our service territory. And we will give you some more clarity on that at our Analyst Day. So, could we do more? Sure. And we're going to – our stated goal is to grow the dividend at 5% to 7%. We have a lot of runway. But I mean, right now that's what we're focused on, the 4% to 6% EPS growth, 5% to 7% dividend growth. If we are at the upper end of our EPS growth rate, we'll never really exceed that 60%. We'd stay – the payout ratio today would stay about the same, which would give us more flexibility. So, it's really – I think we're kind of in a great position to have a lot of levers to reward shareholders. And one of the things everybody worries about is rising interest rates. And if and when that ever happens, it's great to be able to do more with your dividend to perhaps offset that risk, and we've got that flexibility.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then, I wanted to drill a little bit more into the situation in Texas right now. Teresa, you gave a bit of detail in your comments on your requests for a forward-looking test-year based on what the legislation had suggested or allowed for. But could you give us maybe more context here? I think it's difficult to understand the mandate or lack thereof on the Commission and what kind of recourse you would have, what kind of next steps you would have there, if in fact the final decision said no on that.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, maybe we'll start with it wasn't a forward test year in terms of what we had filed. It was basically a historical test year with known and measurable adjustments. So, that was our baseline. The ALJ's recommendation came back excluding those. We do think this is a policy decision and that that would be something that the Commission would make, not necessarily ALJs would make. So, as I've indicated, we're hopeful that when the Commission actually rules on this that they will take into consideration the new legislation that was passed earlier this year to include the post-test year adjustments. Now, they wouldn't be required but we're very hopeful, because it has been basically implemented with the new legislation.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, I think Teresa is right. I mean, the ALJs probably would be more reluctant to make a policy call. And as you know, this is the last rate case we filed prior to that legislation. But the legislation exists, so you would like to think the Commission would look towards that as they review the case. But we're going to know by the end of the year.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And do you think the fact that the case was filed before the legislation was passed is a significant issue?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean, clearly, the legislation was not in place when we filed that case. So, that is a factor.
Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: So, Travis (sic) [Chris] (29:20), just to be clear, this is the last case where essentially the Commission has discretion. On future cases, the decision will be based on the legislation that was passed.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein at UBS.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Hey, I was just curious about if the Minnesota – the next big rate case is going to be multi-year and the Clean Power Plan portion of the IRP is going to be during that – probably some of the construction would be occurring during that period – during a plan that's already been filed and in place. Is there any – can we expect to see some of the construction that's in the IRP before the IRP is approved within the upcoming rate filing in Minnesota?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Maybe I'll start with that and then Ben you can jump in. The things in terms of additional construction potentially and particularly ownership, we do have renewable riders available for infrastructure investment. So, we would think it would be not part of that base rate case plan if that helps explain in terms of how this could play out.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: And also, I'm sorry if I missed this before, but have you guys – have you had any indication so far from other parties about what kind of a – the length of a plan that might be accessible?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Are you talking about now in Minnesota with the three-year plan we filed with the option to go five year?
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. I mean, was there a lot of opposition to five years or – I'm just curious of what the climate is.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think anytime you do something new, you're going to get some resistance. I mean, that's just the way things go. But I have to tell you, I had the opportunity to talk to the Commission, as I've made in my opening remarks, and I think they were pretty interested in learning about it. I think everybody knows there's – we should be looking at more efficient ways to process the recovery of our infrastructure investments. And I think there's compelling reasons to go to five years. That said, I mean if it's three years, it's three years. The key is to have the longest runway possible and to close the regulatory gap and to really – one of the things too is I really want to have more dialogs with all stakeholders and certainly policymakers and regulators about the kinds of opportunities and the things that we need to do to advance the ball here in Minnesota. And that goes for all of our jurisdictions as well.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: What do you think is the key portion of regulatory lag that you're experiencing that you expect to reduce by 50 bps by 2018?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean it's going to – it depends. But I mean, Minnesota is the biggest place. Right? That's where most of the – I know it's the biggest jurisdiction that has some lag. So, a lot of it has to do with the fact that we filed a – we broke ground with a multi-year plan in this last rate case, but it wasn't a comprehensive multi-year plan. We didn't get – it was – we were able to step into large capital projects in that second year, but that meant all the traditional projects, we had to wait. So, that creates lag on that. We've had some property tax increases. We've had forecasts for sales that didn't quite live up to expectations in Minnesota. So, a lot of that – well, some of those – (33:14) sales is taken through with the decoupling mechanism. And the other pieces will pick up in this more comprehensive multi-year plan that we now have available to us via the legislation. I'd say that's the biggest thing, wouldn't you, Teresa?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. No. I would agree. And some of the lag historically has been tied to specific issues. And Ben was mentioning like property taxes, but Monticello in terms of some exclusions of the investment, I mean that's behind us in terms of resolving that issue. Even going back a couple of years, the Sherco, the catastrophic incident that caused some lag as well. But those big issues we think are behind us. And as Ben indicated, this will be a comprehensive filing that we think will well position us.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And just to build on what Teresa said is, I mean, this is a case that's very straightforward. It's a recovery of capital investments. So, I mean it's a capital-based case. I mean there's a very little O&M in this filing. So, I mean, that's been one of the things we wanted to do, is bring down our operating expenses and we're accomplishing that.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: So, would it be safe to say that you're being conservative when you project, say, was it a 9.1%, I think, for next year ROE?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I mean, I'm not quite sure. I wouldn't get fixated on that number.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think we're going to be – our guidance is symmetrical, so you can kind of do the – we've got as much upside as downside to be in the middle of the range. We're going to make improvement in 2016, and then it's going to be steady improvement. I mean, there's – how much and what we can accomplish in 2016 is going to – Minnesota is going to move the needle, obviously, what happens there, but there's other jurisdictions as well. But I think we're in a really, really good shape to achieve our reduction of 50 basis points lag by 2018.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Well, thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Have you – maybe it's early in the process, but have you kind of quantified what your annual – how much you'd like the rate base in Colorado for natural gas?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We've never really quantified it and we're going to start relatively small and build on that. But I mean, if we just look at the LDC requirements in Colorado, and if you assume we did about 25% of that through gas – natural gas reserves in rate base, I think over a decade you're probably looking at about $500 million, okay, could be more. Obviously, you could more than 25% and you could obviously expand that beyond just the LDC requirements in Colorado. Does that help?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just so do you think you would do it as chunky or kind of do the same size annually or...?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't think you want to do it all at once.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But I mean I think there's probably logistical things you would have to consider. So, I don't think it would just be – I think it would be semi-chunky, how's that?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Obviously, it just depends on the asset opportunities and how big they are.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's what I – that's better said.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Good morning. Are you there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. Yes, we're here.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to make sure. A couple of things. You guys put a pretty compelling story up for the multi-year plan and what have you, I missed that (37:10). But I'm just wondering if it were not to happen, are there other levers that you guys are contemplating for, perhaps, closing the ROE lag or potential ROE lag, going forward?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, we're obviously going to do everything we can to achieve our earnings goals. So, we'd have to see. I mean I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to get a multi-year plan in place. It'd rather be five years, it could be three years. And I think there is a lot of openness to that. So, I think we're getting into really hypothetical situations. We'd have to react to whatever the Commission, as we always do, gave us. And the point is we're going to – we'd have to be even probably more disciplined on the cost side. But you start to get – you can achieve earnings goals, but at some point I think they cut into some of your other objectives with building out the infrastructure, modernizing it, getting customers better options, achieving environmental excellence; all those things that are kind of the hallmark of Xcel Energy. So, I don't think that's a bridge we're going to have to cross, Paul.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You know I would agree with you. I mean, frankly, we've already completed one multi-year plan, so we have the precedent behind us.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're right Teresa. It'd be a real step back.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And we have the new legislation. So, I mean, that seems like minimal risk that we would not be able to complete a multi-year. It's just how many years.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Then the second question, and I apologize I just didn't get this completely. You guys mentioned I think transferring assets transmission assets from SPS to a Transco. Could you elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of the size of the assets, what have you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, these are assets that are in Kansas and Oklahoma, where we no longer serve retail load there. You might recall we sold those jurisdictions off a few years ago. So, we think it's an opportune time to move those assets, and specifically they're worth about $100 million, into one of our Transcos and seed those Transcos with some assets.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And maybe just to supplement that, it's about 230 miles of transmission line. It is 345 kV, and it's the line plus some additional equipment that goes with the line.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: It sounds pretty small. So, the purpose of this – I mean, obviously, you might want to prefer them in (39:59) Transcos. Like you said, it's to seed it, so therefore you could expand on it, you think, in a more effective way. What are some of the more effective way than where it currently is?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean it's small, but I bet you a lot of other people would love to have that opportunity, as everybody competes for that. And I think there is some value too to have some actual assets inside a Transco. As I think it gives you more gravitas, if you will, when we get into the FERC 1000 bidding process.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It will help in terms of establishing the public utility status in Kansas for the Transco.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, there's several benefits of seeding it.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. So, I guess, we'll stay tuned on that. And then, on wind versus fossil, and you made some intriguing comments that way (40:49) that I think without the tax credit, you think it will be competitive. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that or just quantify that slightly to me in terms of what you're – how competitive you're seeing in terms of fossil?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean let's start with what we have today. Okay. And I'll stick with wind, which does enjoy the production tax credit, which is worth about $22 a megawatt hour. So, with that credit in mind, we're see wind deals that have come to us across all of our regions in the mid-$20s megawatt-hour levelized 20 years. Now, compare that, Paul, to what we could go out today and buy a strip of natural gas future contracts for. I mean, even in this low gas price environment, if you took those gas reserves, took it, times it by the applicable heat rate, I think you'd find $25 a megawatt hour for wind would be on parity, if not in the money. So, essentially, what we're doing when we're buying wind is hedging natural gas volatility. Now, obviously, if you take away $22 from the equation, you're not looking at $25, you're looking at $47. It's a little bit out of the money. Of course, natural gas prices are at historic lows. And then, I would say that – and this applies to solar as well, is that they continue, these technologies, at large scale, to become more and more efficient. And so, I don't think their pricing's going to go up. I think if – wind, if anything, will stay flat. But I mean we've seen – gosh, in just five years, we've seen capacity factors go from the mid-30%s to now the low-50%s. So, they've seen steady improvements. We all know the story with solar. So, I'm optimistic about it.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And I guess, we're just looking at a pure megawatt-hour. We're not talking about the benefit of dispatch or anything like that. You're just saying if you look at it from a pure megawatt-hour perspective and with technology...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: ...you're thinking that you can get somewhere close to that.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. But Paul, I mean, that's a really good question and I'd be happy to talk to you more about it, because I was just looking at that – I used wind as an example, because I think it's easy to get your arms around. Wind, today, you still have a – you still build a gas plant, right? Okay. But whether you fire up that gas plant with natural gas or you idle it and have it ready to go, but you displace that natural gas with wind is the equation I was talking to you about. It gets a little more complicated when we talk about solar. And the way I'd look at it briefly is that probably the capacity value that you bake into that is the difference between a combined cycle plant and a combustion turbine plant, roughly. I mean, it gets a little bit more complicated and we probably can take it offline.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. Sure.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But it's pretty exciting economics. And then, you get the ancillary costs as you get more on the system. It's one of the reasons why we're studying more and more of what batteries can do for us. It's not like batteries are in the money for us today, but neither was solar 10 years ago. And so, we want to be ready for when the technology moves into the value part of our sweet spot.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Great. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andy Levi at Avon Capital Advisers.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey Andy.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Andy.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Hi. Good morning. Actually, I think I'm all set. But maybe just a couple housekeeping stuff. Just on the stock issuance or lack of it. So, even the DRIP is eliminated, so the shares should kind of stay where they are for the next couple of years, there would be no increase in the shares at all or there are some type of employee plans or...?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's correct, Andy.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. Good. Okay, because I had a couple of million a year. Okay. And then I think it's called the Courtenay Wind Farm. Is that correct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: I got that right? What's the status of that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All approvals have been received and we're in the construction mode. It's going very well.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. And that'll come online the end of 2016?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Towards the end of 2016, a little before the end of 2016.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. Is there anything in your 2016 forecast for Courtenay?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We haven't updated our CapEx for Courtenay, Andy. And of course, that'll be one of the things that we update for you at our Analyst Day.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. But that would really be – that would be 2017 earnings or you would get some AFUDC from that? Isn't there some type of rider in Minnesota or something like that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. There is a rider mechanism.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Right. So, I guess, I understand you didn't update the CapEx, but is that incorporated in your forecast that you gave for 2016 or not?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, it's – that part of it's all embedded in that overall 2016 guidance number we gave you.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. That's great. And then, just one last question on the gas reserves.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Just to understand, you wouldn't strike a deal with a farmer, for no better way to put it, without regulatory approval, is that correct, or would you go to the regulators even though you don't – the scheme itself is not finalized?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean, we wouldn't get ahead of ourselves if that's what you mean. We're going – I mean, I'm not quite sure what your question is. I mean, I think you get the framework...
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Well, I guess...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You get the framework established, Andy, and then you – if it then – the specific way you implement that, I think if it's in the framework, you give yourself the leeway so you don't have to run back and have this endless clock running. But I mean, that's kind of what we're trying to establish now is how you would execute on it and what the model would look like.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Right. But the framework is not set yet, is that correct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. We're going to file before the end of the year, the framework.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. I got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: But we love doing deals with farmers, so...
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: There you go. There you go. And I'll leave that alone. I won't talk about those new Colorado farmers, so...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, that's good load, Andy.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. 0.5% I heard, net of growth, isn't it something – but seriously, isn't it like 0.5%?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, it's not insignificant.
Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: All right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning. Just a question. It looks like the Street and most of us are expecting the company to narrow the earnings gap from 100 basis points to 50 basis points, and you've been very clear that you hope to get there by 2018. But if I thought longer term, do you think there's an ability to narrow that gap even more to maybe earning your allowed return in all your businesses?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That is the goal. So, yeah – I mean, the answer is yes. And we're...
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Is it an attainable goal or is it just structural that it's hard to do with large CapEx spend, or...?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think it's – no, it's not a vision that can't be achieved. It's aspirational, I guess, you would say. But it's not pie in the sky, by any means. Look at what we've already done in Colorado with our multi-year plan.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Look what we're doing in Wisconsin. I hope to be able to report really positive results for you in Minnesota. So, Texas, that's probably going to be harder when you're in historic mode and building a lot of capital. But at some point, you're – that capital profile slows down a bit and so the lag becomes less pronounced. So, I think it's not impossible at all.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean I think that's why we were so focused on multi-year plans. The tenants have multi-year plans because it provides flexibility that could allow opportunity to earn a greater return.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Cost control, sales, all of that would enter into that at that point.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: What do you think the opposite – like as you're introducing multi-year plans in Minnesota, I think, Ben, you had said you met with some of the – I don't know if it was regulators or whatever, and they were very interested in the multi-year plan. I mean just what would be the opposition to a multi-year plan for the regulators?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Change.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: That's – okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I mean that's probably the one word I would use.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think the multi-year plan just to supplement that, because we are using forecasts and potentially whether it'd be a question of over earnings, and I think we could put things in place to moderate that, if we get in that event.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. But I mean there's change and then you can sub-bullet points under it. But the reality is it's different from the way we've done it before.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: And I guess, in Minnesota, there's always the ability, if the regulator believes you're over-earning in a long-term plan, to call you back in. Is that correct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Every jurisdiction has that ability.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Perfect. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, we appreciate it. Thank you.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks.
Operator: And with no further questions left in the phone queue, Teresa, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Teresa Madden for any additional and closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions. And we look to seeing you at EEI.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks everyone.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks.
Operator: And this does conclude today's presentation. We thank everyone for their participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Company Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 second quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions. This morning, we will update you on recent legislative, regulatory, and business developments, review our 2015 second quarter results, and reaffirm our 2015 earnings guidance range. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webpage. Please note we have updated our slides to provide more information. In addition, we will post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing our financial results. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Paul and good morning. Today I'm going to provide a business update and discuss our recent legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas. Later, Teresa will provide more detail on some of our recent regulatory decisions and financial drivers. We reported $0.39 for the quarter, flat with last year. Overall, we've had a solid first half of 2015, with results generally in line with our expectations. While we've had some challenges from lower than expected sales, unfavorable weather and additional adjustments from the Monticello proceeding, we fully expect to deliver 2015 ongoing earnings within our guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. I want to start by saying how pleased I am with the company's response to recent storms across our Minnesota and Wisconsin service territories. Two weekends ago, intense winds with speeds between 70 to 80 miles per hour knocked out service for 250,000 customers. Our employees in the field responded quickly and effectively, restoring 75% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% within 45 hours. All of our customers were restored to power within three days. This event is yet another reminder of the company's top-tier storm restoration efforts and illustrates the value of building a resilient system. We also hit several additional operational milestones during the quarter that I wanted to share with you. Beginning with our Monticello nuclear facility, we are very happy to report that this month we received NRC concurrence and reached 671 megawatts of generation. The facility is now fully in service, operating at designed capacity and meets all the requirements of the Minnesota commission to be considered used and useful. Finally, our Cherokee combined-cycle natural gas plant in Colorado successfully completed its first fire on gas and is on time and on budget. Last year we spoke to you about our refocused strategic plan with a key tenet being improving the performance of our utilities and reducing the ROE gap. Our approach was to target the jurisdiction where the gap was the greatest and seek legislation in those states to improve the timeliness and method of cost recovery. Beginning with Minnesota, last month the Governor signed into law a bill that contained several notable enhancements to the regulatory framework. The legislation expands the length of multi-year plans to up to five years, allows for a more formulaic approach to recovering capital investments, provides for the recovery of O&M expense based on an industry index, and allows rider recovery of distribution costs that facilitate grid monetization. We're now considering how to include these improved mechanisms in our Minnesota rate case filing scheduled for later this year. In Texas, we, along with several other non-ERCOT utilities sponsored legislation that will reduce regulatory lag and provides for improved inclusion of post test year capital additions, more timely implementation of new rates, and greater flexibility and more timely recovery of new natural gas plant investments. The Governor signed the bill last month and while this does not eliminate all regulatory lag in Texas, it does represent an important incremental step towards improvement. We feel the legislation in both Minnesota and Texas strengthens the regulatory compact, helps to close the ROE gap and enhances our ability to meet our long-term earning growth objectives. Moving to Colorado, we anticipate that the Colorado Commission will be scheduling informational meetings to examine the long-term supply of natural gas and approaches to managing prices, including the rate basing of natural gas reserves. We continue to see the value of these types of investments for our customers, particularly when considering the current low-price commodity environment. After the information meetings are held, we plan to make a regulatory filing before year end that will establish a formal framework that incorporates feedback from the meetings. Following the commission's decision on a preferred framework, we anticipate filing for the approval of potential investments during the second half of 2016. In Minnesota, we were pleased to see, the Minnesota Commission supported our settlement with smaller solar developers, which limits the size of proposed solar gardens to no more than 5 Megawatts. This important policy settlement ensures that Minnesota has one of the largest community solar gardens in the country rather, but also minimizes the impact of the program on our customers' bills. Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar and we view it as an important and growing component of our resource mix. However, we want to ensure that it's done at the most attractive price point for our customers. A couple of recent studies confirm that utility scale solar is far more cost-effective for consumers than smaller applications and we think it's important that policy be based on these sound economics. So while solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy subsidization from non-participants, you will continue to see us advocate that the primary focus be on utility scale solar so that we can keep energy cost affordable for consumers as we move to cleaner energy sources. So I think we've made significant progress during the first half of the year. We look forward to implementing some of these new mechanisms and policies in the coming months. And with that, I'll turn it over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Ben and good morning. Today we reported ongoing earnings for the second quarter of $0.39 per share, flat with last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter were improved electric margin, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share, largely due to new rates and higher rider revenue driven by infrastructure investments that provide long-term value to our customers. These incremental revenues were partially offset by unfavorable weather and lower sales. Additionally, offsetting the higher electric margin was increased depreciation, higher property taxes, and lower AFUDC. Each of these items separately had a negative $0.02 per share impact on earnings. Turning to sales, our year-to-date weather-normalized electric sales were down four-tenths of a percent, driven primarily by declines in the residential class, partially offset by modest growth in the C&I class. Regardless, we continue to experience healthy economies in our service territories with an average unemployment rate of 4% compared to a national rate of 5.5%. Our customer additions remain solid at about 1%. The decline in residential sales is driven by lower customer usage. We believe this trend is due to a combination of factors including appliance efficiency, conservation efforts, and an increase in multi-unit dwellings. We have adjusted our annual electric sales guidance to reflect year-to-date results, which lowers our expected growth rate for 2015 to about 0.5%. We will continue to monitor sales and customer usage and will take appropriate management action if we determine this represents a long-term trend. It is important to note that we will be implementing de-coupling for the residential and small C&I class in Minnesota in 2016, which will offset any decline in customer usage trend. Next I will provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Earlier this month, we received decisions on several outstanding items under reconsideration in our Minnesota electric rate case and our Monticello prudence proceeding. The Commission allowed NSP Minnesota to recover its 2015 rate increase beginning in early March and determined that the Monticello extended power upgrade investment was not used and useful until certain NRC conditions were met. These conditions were met in early July. While we believe that the Commission should have concluded differently related to the in-service date of the Monticello project, we will review the written order to determine our next steps. In Colorado, last month we received intervenor testimony in our PSCo multi-year natural gas rate case. The staff recommended a rate decrease, while the Office of Consumer Council recommended a modest rate increase. Primary differences between the Company and other parties were driven by ROE, capital structure, and whether to use a historical test year in the establishment of base rates. The positions recommended by the staff in the OTC were consistent with past positions and we remain confident we will reach a constructive outcome in the case. Finally, I wanted to address our rate case in New Mexico. After another utility in the state had its case dismissed, the New Mexico Commission determined our filing also did not comply with their new interpretation of the statute regarding forward test years and the timing of rate case submissions. As a result, the Commission dismissed our case as well. We believe our filing was consistent with the requirements of the New Mexico legislation that allows for a forward test year and have appealed to the State Supreme Court. While the timing of resolution is uncertain, we plan to re-file the case later this year. This morning we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver earnings in our guidance range due to the timing of O&M expenses and revenue recognition from the Minnesota rate case, both of which will provide for a more favorable comparison in the second half of the year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are very pleased with the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas during the quarter. The new legislation provides a framework that will allow us to reduce regulatory lag and streamline the regulatory process. As a result, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of reducing the ROE gap by 50 basis points by 2018. Growth projects like the Courtenay Wind Farm are on schedule. We remain on track to limit increases in O&M to 0% to 2% for 2015. The company is well positioned to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually and our dividend at 5% to 7%. And finally, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per share. So operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Considering the legislation in Texas and the legislation in Minnesota and you are now very confident of increasing or reducing the regulatory lag by 50 bps by 2018, just wondering if, at what point would you consider increasing your long-term growth rate commensurate with the improvement in ROEs?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that's what we're focused on is closing that gap. And if we close that gap by 50 basis points that will get us on the upper end of those growth objectives. So you'd have to start to exceed that and see some other things before we would be comfortable doing that Michael.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Would you say that it would require a, I guess, wait and see after the results of a rate filing in Texas? Is that...?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We need to implement it. We are working the plan. This is the legislation. While it wasn't essential to close that gap, it's certainly helpful. And now we need to execute on that and let things play out.
Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Good morning.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Hi, thanks. On the Minnesota legislation, just wonder if you could lay out maybe a more detailed timeline in terms of – I know it's obviously one of your lower spreads on – a wider spread between allowed and earned right now. How do you go about closing that, sort of taking advantage of the legislative items?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, you are absolutely right. We have been under-earning in Minnesota. If you are looking at the charts by the way that were attached, keep in mind that that's a little bit distorted due to some revenue recognition. But you are right; it's been in the mid-8s and we need to improve that. Take a look at what we did in Colorado. When you get into a multi-year plan, I think you've got a much better shot at closing that ROE gap. You are getting all of your capital recovery; you are getting your O&M potentially recovered and I think Travis, the other thing that I think is so important about entering into these multi-year plans is it gives you an opportunity to communicate more frequently with your commissions around important policy decisions, resource plans decisions, where we want to go with our portfolio generation et cetera. So you don't get disconnects. And I think if you look at why we've under-earned, we've had a lot of CapEx going through a funnel. We had to relicense our nuclear plants. We had some challenges there as everyone in the industry did. And we didn't have a lot of forums to communicate some of those challenges. So it's not only the mechanisms associated with the legislation in the multi-year plan; it's kind of what that frees you up to do. And I am optimistic that we will make good progress next year and in the years to come.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay, great. Do you think this is something you could do in one cycle for your multi-year plan or is this closing up the gap, would that take two rate cases or two cycles? Is this something that you can close quickly?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the multi-year plan, as you know the legislation allows for up to five years and allows a number of other things. The regulatory team is busy right now assessing how we put those tools to work, what alternatives we want to present to the department and ultimately the commission and we'll figure out – we'll use the tools that we can and do it in a pragmatic approach. Now, depending on how you structure that, do you get it all in one year? – Not necessarily. But do you get it over the timeframe of the filing? – Yes. That would be the plan.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Great, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: We will take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Ben. Good morning, Teresa. Have you indicated when you are going to re-file in New Mexico?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We have just indicated that we will re-file before the end of the year.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: It seems as though the commission has kind of said we want a do-over with PNM. How does that play into the timing?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean – are you talking about the appeal or – I mean right now the commission has taken the rule back and is trying to I guess maybe understand their own interpretation of the rules. So we recognize that there might be some time lag with that, Paul. So we will re-file a case that we think will meet their current interpretation of the rules by year end, so we can get to start it while we are trying to sort through what the future test year rule and legislation really means from a administrative standpoint.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. I mean, we obviously think that the legislation allows for the forward tester as we had previously interpreted and that's why we are filed with the Supreme Court in terms of an appeal.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Did I answer your question Paul?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes, you did. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And where – you kind of walked down the growth numbers. Where are you seeing the most weakness?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Seeing the most what?
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Weakness.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean – and Teresa, jump in here, but it's really been on the residential side. And we are seeing good growth, Paul; we are seeing about 1% customer growth but what's happening we believe is you've got energy efficiency – some of that we are driving of course. And you have – where we are thinking some of the growth is, is in more multi-unit dwellings which inherently use less electricity. So those two factors combined are putting – or offsetting growth with lower usage per household.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. I mean, just to supplement that in the multi-units, we think they use about 50% what a standard, stand-alone dwelling or home would use. So you get the customer growth, but just not at the same pace in terms of adding to our growth.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Have you seen efficiency start to plateau with I guess a lot of the light bulbs already been switched out and a lot of the appliances have been switched out? Where are we in that cycle?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You know that's a really good question, Paul. I mean I think if you look at technology, it's going to continue to get more efficient. Will the pace of that efficiency slow down? – I don't know if I have a crisp answer for you at this point. But I wouldn't think that it's going to plateau and just level off. I think you're going to continue to see more efficiencies; you're going to continue to start to see – as we get to the, ultimately the Internet of Things, even more efficiency. I think we are a few years away from that. But the gas business has been a long-term efficiency cycle and I think we will see that on the electric side. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. It does mean though, back to the earlier comment that we have to start rethinking rate design and what the 21st century regulatory compact and offerings to our consumers look like. That's one of the reasons again, why we think it's so important to have longer-term regulatory compact, so you can have these dialogues with your policymakers.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much for your time.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to focus on Minnesota. You're successful at getting a legislation for potentially a five-year deal, but I think previously I think you had the ability to file for three-year deals but I think maybe you filed for two. Is there reluctance on the regulator for granting a longer-term deal? Some states, you see regulators push back on longer-term deals. I wonder what's your feeling or view of that in Minnesota.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, keep in mind that prior to this legislation, the multi-year compact was not really comprehensive. So when we filed, we were able to file for larger step-in type capital programs. This legislation was passed with input from a lot of important parties, including the Department and certainly the Governor's office and it was passed and it was supported. That said, I think to your point, this could be transformative, it's change, and I think our team has to work with the department and make sure that they're comfortable with the pace of what we are doing. So that's what we are trying to assess right now. So your question is a good one. I think the policymakers support it. I think there is a number of reasons why the business community would want this and it's good for our customers and this could be tremendously more efficient than how we process rate cases today. So I am optimistic we are going to use the majority of those tools and come out with something far more comprehensive than we had prior to this legislation.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: And I guess on your next filing you would file, you would attempt to get the full five years?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're going to incorporate a number of the tools. We'll figure out – I mean, I would anticipate that we will look at the five years, figure out how that could be done, but I also anticipate that we'll present the Commission with different alternatives. The key is, get something comprehensive, make use of the tools, and close that regulatory gap. So that is always the first and foremost in mind. And again, we want something that frees up space to have a timeframe that we can work with the Commission on other important policy decisions.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Paz with Wolfe Research.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, David.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, David.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Just on Minnesota filing, when would you expect a final decision? On the November filing.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The pending case that we haven't filed yet?
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Sorry, yes. On the November filing.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It could take either late in 2016, it could – depending on the schedule, other cases that we know are going to be filed, we could go into 2017. But I think the key thing that's important is we have interim rates and we are anticipating that those will start just as they always have. I mean, that's still part of the new compact that we have starting in January 1, 2016. So I think that's really the key thing to be focused on.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Okay. And separately, did you update your capital plan for the Courtenay Wind Farm?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We haven't updated it yet; we plan later this year. I mean, we'll do a more comprehensive update. I mean, we have disclosed the cost is about $300 million and so – again, we'll do a more comprehensive look later this year.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And that project's moving along very well, so...
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: David, we expect that the Commission is going to probably rule on – the Commission in North Dakota and in Minnesota will rule on that in August.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, great. And then just last, I think your projected rate base growth over the period you've outlined is just shy of 5%.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's correct.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: And so it looks like Courtenay will be added. Any other potential upside to that growth? I know previously you just said that you guys will do a new look soon. But anything we should think about? I mean you mentioned gas rate base, other type of renewable. Just anything else that we might be missing, particularly as carbon rules get at some point finalized?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean, we're going to look at all of those opportunities you mentioned. They are not included in the CapEx forecast right now. Maybe there's more opportunities for Courtney Wind type projects, the Calpine projects that we have done in the past. We've got a great backyard and I think there is a number of opportunities that we think makes sense and are keeping with our low-risk profile that we're going to pursue. We're conservative; we're not going to increase our forecast for things that aren't – that you can't touch. But we're certainly going to go after all the opportunities that makes sense for us. And you hit on a couple of them.
David A. Paz - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Feliks Kerman with Visium Asset Management.
Feliks Kerman - Visium Asset Management: Hi, thank you. Can you just remind us in which states you'll have decoupling in, in 2016?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We will have it in Minnesota. There is an open docket in Colorado, but it has not been acted on for quite some time. But for sure, we will have it in Minnesota.
Feliks Kerman - Visium Asset Management: And is there expectation that we will achieve the decoupling in Colorado or no?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would think – we're under a multi-year plan there, so, no, we don't anticipate that we're going to have decoupling during this – the current multi-year plan that we have. That said, as you know that we've actually exceeded our authorized return in Colorado. So I think barring some major drop-off, there is no reason to really be concerned in Colorado.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I agree.
Feliks Kerman - Visium Asset Management: Okay. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Teresa Madden, Chief Financial Officer, for any additional or closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, thank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning and please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions. Thanks again.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2015 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions. This morning, we will review our 2015 first quarter results, reaffirm earnings guidance for 2015 and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webpage. In addition, we will post a video on our website of Teresa summarizing financial results later this morning. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. First quarter 2015 ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which exclude a charge of $0.16 per share following the decision by the Minnesota Commission in the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.30 per share. Management believes ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of charges related to the prudence review, provide a more meaningful comparison. As a result, the comments on today's call will focus on first quarter ongoing earnings of $0.46 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. Today, I'm going to provide a business update, review several recent regulatory outcomes, speak to you about our legislative efforts in Minnesota and Texas and discuss our recently-increased dividend growth objective. Teresa will provide more details on some of these items. We're beginning 2005 (sic) [2015] (2:03) with a solid start. While timing and weather differences led to some variability in the quarter, our earnings remain on track and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. In February, we increased our dividend almost 7%. We also raised our annual dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and established a formal payout target of 60% to 70%. These actions reflect our confidence in the company's long-term strategic plan, the strength of our balance sheet and our projected cash flows. From an operational perspective, we met key milestones in our transmission business as we energized the final sections on two of our major CapEx 2020 projects, bringing the lines into service on time and on budget. The region will derive meaningful benefits from these valuable assets. We're also pleased to be named the Number-One Wind Provider in the country for the 11th straight year by AWEA. We're pleased to be included in Forbes Magazine of the 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America and to be recognized as the Best for Vets Employer. From a regulatory perspective, we brought three major proceedings to a close. In Colorado, the Commission approved our three-year electric regulatory plan. This constructive multiyear settlement provides rate certainty for our customers and revenue certainty for the company. This represents the second multiyear plan we have implemented in our Colorado electric business and we believe that this agreement can serve as blueprint for our pending natural gas rate case. Turning to Minnesota, we continue to believe we acted prudently throughout the construction process at our Monticello nuclear facility. The important takeaway is that our customers and the region will benefit from a safe, reliable and diverse fuel mix, including nuclear, for many years to come. While we disagree with some of the Commission's findings, and we will need to review the final order, it does represent resolution of an issue that has been an overhang on the company. Finally, in our inaugural, multiyear rate case in Minnesota, we were encouraged that the Commission generally agree with the ALJ recommendations in the proceeding, and supported the company's position on many of the key issues. While we would have preferred to avoid a 2016 regulatory filing and we felt we provided a path to do so, we believe the final result was a reasonable outcome. However, we continue to believe there is an opportunity for future improvement and streamlining of the regulatory process. We feel that more specific legislation will facilitate this, and provide greater predictability for customers and the company. In order to achieve the ambitious state and federal policy initiatives that are quickly approaching, it's important that the company have additional tools at its disposal to meet these evolving requirements. As a result, we've been proactively working with key stakeholders on a multiyear plan regulatory bill currently being considered by the Minnesota Legislature. Some of the key components of this regulatory compact include: expanding to a five-year multiyear plan, allowing for formulaic recovery of capital investments, recovery of O&M expenses based on an electric industry price index, continuation of interim rates while the plan's under consideration, and protections in the event of unforeseen developments. The proposed multiyear plan legislation is contained in the omnibus House energy bill. The state omnibus energy bill does not include the multiyear plan legislation. The energy bills have passed the floor vote in both the House and the Senate. The bills will now be reconciled in Conference Committee, and we expect the final bill will include the multiyear plan legislation. Once the Committee has reconciled the bill, it will be sent back to the Senate and House for a vote. And while the process remains fluid, we are cautiously optimistic regarding its passage. If successful, we will look to incorporate components of the bill, as appropriate, in our rate filings in the future. In Texas, we've worked with various stakeholders on a bill that addresses regulatory lag. The regulatory bill passed out of the House Committee earlier this month, and we're waiting for it to be scheduled for a vote on the floor. The proposed legislation provides for the inclusion of post-test year rate base additions and supports the implementation of more timely surcharges. However, industrial customers continue to have concerns with the bill, and we are currently working to resolve these issues. We're hopeful that the bill will be passed into law, as it is an important step towards reducing regulatory lag and would help to facilitate investment in the growing area. Late last year, we discussed our plans to focus on incremental growth opportunities in transmission and natural gas assets. Recently, we've been socializing the concept of rate basing natural gas reserves in Colorado. We're working with stakeholders to see if we can schedule a series of discussions to explore the concept of rate basing natural gas reserves, and how to best take advantage of the current low natural gas price for the benefit of customers and the company alike. Finally, I wanted to brief you on – about an exciting new investment that we're pursuing. Courtenay is a 200-megawatt wind power purchase agreement that NSP-Minnesota signed in 2013. For various reasons, the developer has decided to exit the project, providing us an opportunity to pursue ownership of the wind farm and to ensure that our customers will benefit from the addition of cost-effective wind generation. We are seeking regulatory approval in Minnesota and North Dakota to take this project over and eventually place it in rate base. The facility is expected to be in service at the end of 2016 and cost approximately $300 million. The project is not included in our current five-year capital forecast, and we don't anticipate needing to issue any incremental equity to finance it. We've made significant progress in the first four months of this year, and I look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings for the first quarter of $0.46 per share, versus $0.52 per share last year. While the quarter was subject to some timing differences and an adverse weather comparison, the results were in line with our expectations. The most-significant driver in the quarter was improved electric margin that resulted from new rates. However, the weather comparison versus 2014 was significant causing a $0.05 per share negative variance. Increased O&M and depreciation, along with the higher effective tax rate, were also notable offsets. Now, let me provide an update on sales in the economies in our local service territories. Weather-normalized electric sales increased at 0.5% for the quarter and natural gas sales rose 2.9%. In the first quarter of 2014, we experienced very cold weather. As we all know, the weather normalization process is not an exact science. And it is possible that our first quarter 2014 weather-normalized sales may have been somewhat distorted. With that in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2015 electric weather-adjusted sales growth assumptions of 1%. Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP-Wisconsin, weather-adjusted retail sales increased 1.7% due primarily to growth in the oil, gas and sand mining-related businesses. Electric sales at SPS increased 1.9%, driven by growth in both the residential and C&I classes. While we are closely monitoring the impact of oil prices on production activity, the Permian Basin has been resilient. PSCo's electric sales increased 0.4%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class due to the expansions in the healthcare and technology services sectors. Finally, NSP-Minnesota's electric sales decreased 0.5% as usage declines more than offset new customer addition in both the residential and C&I classes. Overall, our service territories remain healthy, particularly relative to the rest of the nation. Consolidated unemployment in our regions is 4.2%, well below the national average of 5.6%. The number of jobs in our regions grew 2.5% during the quarter compared with 2.3% for the nation. Focusing on the earnings for the quarter, ongoing electric margin increased $40 million. Key drivers included non-fuel riders that increased margin by $34 million, largely reflecting the Clean Air Clean Jobs rider in Colorado, which became effective January 1, 2015. The implementation of final and interim rates increased margin by $23 million and increased net transmission revenue, which improved margin by $7 million. Offsetting these positive factors was an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of $25 million as well as a few other less-significant items. It is worth noting that during the first quarter of 2015, we took a conservative approach to revenue recognition. During the quarter, we continue to book revenues at the 2014 interim rate level and did not assume that the Minnesota Commission would approve our netting proposal, which would have increased revenues by just over $10 million. If the MPEC (12:26) approves our interim rate netting proposal, we will record revenue in that period at the higher authorized level retroactive to January 1, 2015. When thinking about margin comparisons for the reminder of the year, it is important to remember that as we move through the balance of 2014, we recorded increasingly-larger potential refunds to customers, ending the year with a rate increase consistent with the ALJ recommendations. Due to these timing factors, we expect an improving margin comparison in Minnesota for the reminder of the year. Margins on the natural gas side of our business decreased by $12 million for the quarter. This is primarily due to the negative weather comparison, which more than offset higher rider revenue and retail sales growth. O&M expenses increased $26 million in the quarter. The higher level is almost entirely driven by the timing of planned outages. We remain confident that we will achieve our annual O&M growth assumption of zero to 2%. Depreciation expense increased $27 million for the quarter due to capital investment and lower amortization of the excess depreciation reserve in Minnesota. Finally, other taxes increased about $12 million, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. Next, we'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. During the quarter, as Ben indicated, we made significant progress with our regulatory agenda, resolving three key proceedings. Beginning with Minnesota and our multiyear rate filing, we were pleased that the Commission recognized the strength of the company's arguments and largely accepted the recommendations of the ALJ. Based on our interpretation of the Commission's oral deliberations, we estimate a total revenue increase of $168 million, which compares to our revised request of $221 million. The Commission approved a 9.72% ROE, and equity ratio of 52.5%, and a three-year decoupling pilot. We view this as a reasonable outcome and expect the final written order in May. We also concluded final deliberations in our Monticello prudence review. The Commission approved a full return of $415 million of the project's $748 million total cost. However, allowed recovery of the investment with no returns on the remaining $333 million. As a result, we've recorded one-time pre-tax charge of $129 million during the quarter. We estimate that the 2015 ongoing pre-tax impact of the decision will be approximately $16 million on a total company basis. Finally, in February, we were pleased that the Colorado Commission approved the settlement in our electric rate case. The final decision reflected an overall increase of $53 million in 2015 and ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition, we have implemented forward-looking riders for our Clean Air Clean Jobs and transmission-related spending. The agreement covers 2015 through 2017 and continues the productive multiyear regulatory compact that we've been operating under since 2012. In March, the PSCo filed a multiyear natural gas rate case covering 2015 through 2017. We are requesting a 2015 rate increase of about $41 million and subsequent step increases of $8 million in 2016 and $18 million in 2017. The requested ROE is 10.1% in 2015 and 2016, rising to 10.3% in 2017. In addition, we filed for a five-year extension of our pipeline system integrity rider that drives revenue increases of $22 million and $21 million in 2016 and 2017. We filed the gas case with principles generally consistent with the recently-settled electric case, which we hope will provide the framework for our first multiyear natural gas rate plan in Colorado. In our Texas rate case, the schedule had been abated for 30 days in order to allow for settlement discussions. However, we haven't been successful in reaching a settlement; therefore, the procedural schedule to process the case was established on Monday. Regardless, the parties have agreed, rates will be effective in mid-June. Finally, in South Dakota, interim rates of about $16 million went into effect on January 1. We currently are in settlement negotiations with parties, and expect final rates to be effective midyear. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed. For more information, please see our earnings release. With that, I will wrap up my comments. We are pleased to be making progress with our regulatory agenda. We have gained substantial clarity in recent months, and are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential success of our legislative initiatives. We are reaffirming our 2015 ongoing earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. We are excited about the Courtenay Wind Farm investment opportunity. We continue to expect 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%. We are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings 4% to 6% annually. And finally, we are pleased to raise our dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. So, operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go first to Ali Agha at SunTrust.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Ali.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hey. How are you? First off, just to clarify a little bit on Minnesota, Ben or Teresa. So, when we factor in the rate case, and that was just completed, does that make a dent as far as your lag in 2015 is concerned? (19:36) an appreciable improvement in earned ROE this year, or not, versus 2014?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ali, we're going to be pretty consistent where we've been at kind of in the mid-8%s, maybe a little bit higher than that, but it'll be pretty consistent with where we have been at.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: I see. And then, from – just to understand the timing, when would you expect the legislative actions to be completed? And then, how does that relate to the timing of when you would make your next rate case filing there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Unless it goes to extended session, it wraps up in May. And obviously, we've talked about filing a 2016 rate case, Ali. So, we'll see what actually is passed, and then we'll incorporate that into our thoughts going forward. To your former point, I think ,closing the regulatory gap, this 2016 case will be where you'll start to see that improvement – and that's what we've thought all along.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Just to – in terms of timing, Ali, we would expect to be filing right around the November 1 timeframe, so that interim rates for 2016 would go into effect at the first of that year.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Yeah. And then, a bigger picture on this lag issue, as you reiterate, the goal is a 50 basis point reduction in lag by 2018. And can you remind us, embedded in the 2015 guidance, what is the total lag, in terms of a starting point we should be thinking about?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Ali, right now, our lag's running close to 100% (sic) [100 basis points] (21:12), but we're closing 50 basis points, and we expect the trajectory to be lower in the first years, and graduating up to the 2018 timeframe. So, only modest as an initial start.
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Ali, that was 100 basis points.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: 100 basis points.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: What did I say?
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Percent.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I said 100%?
Paul A. Johnson - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That would be bad.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, that would be bad.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And my last question. I know that you don't have any equity plans over the five-year CapEx cycle. And so, when you talk about the earnings CAGR, I believe it's 4% to 6% over that five-year period, from the normalized 2014 base. And the rate base CAGR over that five-year period is 4.7%. Am I correct in those numbers?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well maybe, Ali, just to clarify, we do have some equity issuances through our DRIP and our benefit plans and that's about $75 million a year. But you're correct about the rate base. If we add Courtenay and we're probably just slightly under 5%, in terms of that, and growth continues at 4% to 6% in terms of earnings projection.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Greg Gordon at Evercore ISI.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: So, the things that are happening in the short run here are the filings for the approval of the wind farm. Do you know what the – is there a statutory timeframe under which you expect to get a decision from those two jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't think there's a statutory timeframe, but there's a practical timeframe and we would need to get the decision so that we can meet the construction cycle by late summer.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. Late summer. And then, the legislative session, you indicated, already ends end of May. And then, what is the – what do we have to look forward to in terms of milestones with regard to your seeking to potentially rate base gas reserves? And if you were to get a program equal to your aspirations out of the gate, how would that be – what will you be looking that in terms of size and investment?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think there's a lot of unknowns around that, Greg, to be frank with you. And like we said, I mean, what we're trying to do is set up the discussions in Colorado. Focus then on the LDC gas business, get some consensus around that and then potentially move forward in 2016. The size and all of that will be based upon those dialogs that we hope to have.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. But you're starting with the concept of procuring reserves for retail supply to the LDC business, not procuring reserves for power generation fuel?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome, Greg.
Operator: And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Julien.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: So, perhaps, the first quick question going back to Minnesota legislation. When you think about the time period that you could stay out and implementing it, in theory, in this 2016 case, what would you be – what kind of period are we talking about as best you understand it? And then – and perhaps a more relevant question here. If you don't get the legislation by the end of May or what have you, as you think about the 2016 case, is there any potential to have a multiyear stay out under any variety of the scenarios that would exclude legislation?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, Julien, we had a path to stay out of 2016, but it was going to be based upon how we handled certain depreciation reserves. And so, when that opportunity was not taken, it put us in a position, as you know, that we are going to file the 2016 case. Now, we have mitigation tools still available to us. If the legislation pass, we might have more tools, longer timeframes that we can do. But even if the legislation doesn't pass, we are going to follow a multiyear plan in 2016. And when we look at our spend profile and our recovery needs, I think the longer the plan is, the more modulation and mitigation we can use for the benefit of our customers and for clarity for us. So, I think we've got a pretty solid path to start to close that regulatory lag. It's been really pronounced in Minnesota. Legislation will help, but the traditional way to file a rate case, although laborious, also works.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: And perhaps, I know this is very tough to ask. But how do you think about collapsing the rate lag, just organically given smaller rate case prospectively in 2016? I mean, how much of the improvement here is simply, again, just another filing with a more modest ask and having some of those mitigation tools versus having a legislation in hand and leveraging some of those tools that enables you? I mean, what kind of delta are we talking about? And I know that's putting a lot (26:44).
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Pretty hard to quantify that, I would say. I mean, let me just say that the majority of the ask in 2016, whether we use legislative initiatives or what we have available to use now, is going to be capital driven. So, Julien, I think that always helps. Capital is always less controversial than O&M. The advantage, though, of a longer timeframe is that we have more opportunities to sculpt the capital to – and the mitigation tools to take advantage of the fact that the pace of investment does start to slow down. And again, what we've talked about before is that we really need to have longer timeframes where we're not in front of the regulator, look to just kind of proceeding trying to get rate relief, because there is a lot of policy discussions that we want to have and, frankly, I think our Commission wants to have with us. But we can't do that right now. So, that was the disappointment really of having to follow 2016 case, as there is a lot going on and it kind of makes it harder to have those dialogs. But the dialogs will happen. So, did I answer your question, hopefully?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: As best you could, I appreciate it. And then, maybe in separate direction here...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That means no.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: It's a little bit easier. A little bit more palatable. Can you comment around SPS and, just generally speaking, the environment to-date in terms of the commodity impact, et cetera? What are you seeing prospectively in terms of capital need?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: In SPS, is that what you're asking?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, just given the lower oil price environment.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It really hasn't had much of an impact at all. The Permian Basin is a good place from an economic standpoint. We understand that there is more supply chain initiatives from the developers squeezing out more cost. But the other thing – and I think that's very important to recognize – is that we had a tremendous backlog. So, you've got well – we've got the majority of the wells that stood on – are still running on very expensive diesel and things like that. So, there is a lot of backlog. It gives us time to catch up. Ultimately, I think prices will rebound it a bit. But I think we're in pretty good shape there. And the other thing that's happening is, in that area of the country, there is other economic activity as well. So, still going pretty strong and the sales growth expectations down in that region are pretty strong and we think will continue to be so.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Great. Thank you, guys.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And we'll go next to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Good morning. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Travis.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Hi. Wondering as you went through the 2014-2015 rate stuff in Minnesota, were there lessons learned through that whole process that you expect to embed in the 2016 case? Anything that you might have asked before that you won't ask for now, any adjustments that you'll make based on those negotiations, absent the legislation and that whole side of it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I guess it reaffirmed to us that we need to change the regulatory process. That's why we're seeking the legislation. It doesn't allow us to have the dialogs, Travis, that we mentioned. We need – it's a new world. Our policymakers want us to do more and, frankly, we are doing more. We filed, I think, a very transformational resource plan at the end of last year. We're going to move forward and be very aggressive on renewables. We want to make sure we do that with efficiency in mind, using large-scale renewables. It's tough to do that, as I mentioned, in the rate case. I guess specifically, we need to – we probably self-mitigated a little bit as we filed that rate case, recognizing that it was a big ask. And that puts – those things we didn't ask for will just resurface in 2016, and we'll ask for what we need. And as I mentioned, it's capital-based. These are investments that I think everybody wants us to make. So, we've got to update the regulatory compact in keeping with the times. And I think that's what the e21 Initiative was about, and we're proposing how we implement that in Minnesota.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Maybe just to add to that, and I think you touched on it, Ben. I mean one thing that was definitely reconfirmed was the tolerance for the customer bill...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And the legislation clearly will have – assuming it goes forward – have parameters that will help us, in terms of the longer term, to manage through that, with the capital investment that Ben mentioned.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And just – you need more tools, you need to have different kinds of dialogs, and that's what we would get with legislation. But we can do it the old fashioned way too.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Just not as efficient.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Great. And then, what's your latest thinking on competitive transmission? Any project you're looking at out there, any – is that at all part of the growth strategy still?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We don't – as you know, we haven't assumed – what we have in our transmission CapEx is – it's state-regulated, and it's identified. It's not pie in the sky. So, we don't have competitive transmission. But there are – but the opportunities are fewer, as you know, than what, I think, people were talking about a year ago. But there's some opportunities, and we're looking at a relatively small opportunity in MISOs, and potentially some smaller opportunities in SPP, which I think will give us a chance to understand how competitive bidding will work. Relatively small right now. I think, as the EPA rules get clarified and both SPP and MISO refine their projects, or refine the needs, we'll have more opportunities to bid competitively.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We still think it'll be there, it's just delayed a bit.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Exactly, Teresa.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Research: Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Angie.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Angie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hello. How are you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I just want to go back again to this Minnesota legislation. I mean we've been following it, and so here are a couple of concerns that we have. First of all, it seems like the legislature is split in Minnesota. And so, why do you feel convinced or hopeful that both House and the Senate can agree on the version of a bill that will actually include those multiyear rate cases? And more importantly, so we had this issue in Colorado already, that the regulators then didn't necessarily think that the new law is really binding, it's more of a suggestion. So, how likely is it that we do get a bill, and then the regulators in Minnesota think that it's still an option for them to pursue or not, and then we may end up in yet another rate case?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, couple questions that you asked. First of all, as we all know, sausage making and the political process can be kind of messy. And that's what we are in. But what we're being told, and what we understand is, while there is controversy between the House and Senate bill, and that's the difference between Republican versus DFL controlled, and their different interests, the multiyear plan provisions really aren't controversial. So, when this thing goes to Conference Committee, we think it's a very good possibility that the provisions of the multiyear plan remain. While you can only be cautiously optimistic, because it is a political process, and if there were things in the final bill that was passed by both House and Senate that were unappealing to the Governor, you always have a risk of veto. So, that's the reality there. In terms of whether it will be viewed by the Commission as an option versus a mandate, I think, one, you'd have to look and see how the legislation is finalized. But I also believe that the Commission is frustrated with how the process works in Minnesota to sell (35:30). So, I think you kind of saw that as the Commission was thinking about the opportunity that we said to stay out of 2016. And I'm not sure that they felt they were – it was quite ready. And so, with legislation, even if it's an option versus a mandate, I think, they feel much more comfortable with that. We have Chris Clark here, I don't know if, Chris, you want to add to that?
Christopher B. Clark - President, Northern States Power Company - Minnesota, Xcel Energy, Inc.: I'd agree with that. I think that Commissioners have been interested in engaging in that dialog you talked about earlier Ben. And so, I think the legislation will be viewed as tool that helped to enable that.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And then, I mean maybe it's just my understanding of the House version of the bill. Is that – you would still need to file rate cases according to this bill, right? I mean, maybe not as frequently, but the rate cases would still not be avoided?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think you would file the base year (36:28), right? I mean – and then – but you'd have a much longer runway that you could then use to have more formulaic recovery of your capital spend and your O&M.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: How about the ROEs resetting?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's not really addressed. So, maybe that would come through if there was a change of circumstance or something like that. But I'm starting to speculate now, Angie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. I'm sorry about it. Okay. Thank you.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon at KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Paul.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Are you looking at gas reserves for rate base in any other states besides Colorado, have you started any dialogs yet?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, we haven't. So, we're starting with Colorado. That's the biggest gas use, and we'll move forward from there.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is that something you'll consider.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Yeah.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Yeah. Sure.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We'll consider it. We don't have as much of a gas load, for example, in Minnesota. In Texas, I think some of our larger C&I customers probably would not want us to do that. So, those are factors we'd have to consider, Paul.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then Courtenay, what's the status of Courtenay and is it going to get the PTC?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. That would be the plan, which is why we're on a tighter construction schedule, because it needs to come and service at the end of 2016. But it would be eligible for the PTC credits. And Paul, it's a great project. I mean, it's – the levelized cost of it is way below what we could basically acquire natural gas reserves for. So, it's kind of an indirect way to hedge gas.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And you said that was 200-megawatts for $300 million of capital?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. And just to add to Ben's comment, our target is to have the project done by October of next year. So, we do have a little headroom just in terms of the PTC completion requirement ending at the end of 2016. So, we do have a schedule we need to follow closely. But we do think we have some headroom.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And where is that from?
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In North Dakota.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: North Dakota. Thank you very much.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Paul.
Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Paul.

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Teresa Madden, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if necessary. This morning, we will review our 2014 full year results, reaffirm our 2015 earnings guidance range and update you on strategic plans related to business and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our Web page. In addition, we will post a brief video on our Web site of Teresa summarizing our financial results later this morning. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm going start by highlighting some of the key successes of 2014 and update you on some exciting developments at Xcel Energy. Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. 2014 was another strong year for Xcel Energy as the Company reported earnings of $2.03 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive year we’ve met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the fifth consecutive year we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition, we raised our dividend for the 11th year in a row. From a regulatory perspective, we made significant progress, wrapping up rate cases in Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas. We received a constructive ALJ recommendation in Minnesota and most recently reached a favorable three year settlement in our Colorado electric case. When we filed the case in Colorado, we stated that our objective was to establish a multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. This settlement accomplishes that goal and provides us a reasonable opportunity during our authorized return in our Colorado electric business over the next three years. From an operational perspective I also wanted to take a moment to say how incredibly proud I am of the efforts of our employees this year. We hit record levels of safety in 2014 improving for the seventh straight year. And again we demonstrated our top tier operating performance with industry leading reliability scores. Recall last quarter we unveiled our refreshed strategic plan that was focused on improving utility performance, including the goal of closing the ROE gap by 50 basis points and increasing the amount of revenue generated from long term regulatory agreement. Driving operational excellence by focusing on limiting annual increases and O&M cost to between 0% and 2%, providing our customers more options and solutions and finally investing for the future by focusing on incremental growth opportunities in our natural gas and transmission businesses. Today, we’re excited to update on the progress we’ve made on some of these initiatives. The electric utility industry is in the midst of a major transition and we’re committed to be on the front end of this change. We will be a leader in the same way we proactively implemented our environmental strategy over a decade ago. To this end we are pursuing regulatory changes to better align with the clear direction that customer preferences, federal policies and state initiatives are moving. Las month in Minnesota a collaborative report was issued by a diverse stakeholder group known as the e21 initiative. The group released a set of recommendations that are intended to act as a blueprint for a new customer centric performance based regulatory approach. Following the e21 report, we filed with the Minnesota commission a framework on how we envision enabling these changes. We focused on four key objectives; lowering carbon emission by 40% by 2013; pioneering distribution grid modernization; responding to changing customer preferences and providing new services and products; and finally pursuing more predictable and nimble rate recovery. In order to effectively bring about these changes, it is essential that the company have a longer term more holistic regulatory compact. Longer term multi-year agreements and additional writers are expected to improve visibility and supplement our efforts. Further the company has tools they can utilize to stabilize rate increases and make bills more predictable for our customers. We expect to work with the commission and various stakeholders in Minnesota in 2015 to develop this new regulatory framework and have requested a planning meeting in the coming months to discuss potential options in greater detail. We’re also exploring ways for us to avoid the need to file a 2016 rate case which will allow more time to concentrate on the longer term regulatory framework. In January we filed our resource plan in Minnesota which provides details on how we will achieve our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This will be accomplished by significantly increasing the amount of solar and wind on the NSP system, adding natural gas generation, continuing our industry leading commitment to conservation programs, operating our nuclear plans at least through their current licenses and continuing to run Sherco Units 1 and 2 with gradual decreased reliance on those units to 2030. This proactive no regret strategy will better position the company and our customers for the long run and do so at an incremental cumulative cost of less than 3% to 2030. As a result, by 2030 63% of our energy will be carbon free at NSP. Clearly 2015 is going to be a transformational year in Minnesota.  While much of our discussion is focused on Minnesota, we're also pursuing changes in our Texas jurisdiction. Along with other non-ERCOT utilities, we will be sponsoring legislation this session that will help reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to invest in the system to support growth in the region, which is continuing even in the face of a challenging oil price environment.  Finally, we wanted to update you on our natural gas growth initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to file a general rate case for our Colorado gas business, but finally we'll include a number of investments to maintain and improve the safety and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Concurrent with our rate case, we will begin working with our commission and major stakeholders to explore rate basing natural gas reserves as a way to take advantage of the current low natural gas price and to provide a longer-term hedge for our customers. Following our stakeholder and outreach and education, we expect to make a separate filing to begin the regulatory process. We're excited by the progress we've made and the steps we've taken thus far and I look forward to updating you later this year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa Madden: Thanks Ben and good morning. Today I'll be focusing my discussion on full year 2014 results. We are pleased to close out another solid year with ongoing earnings of $2.03 per share compared with 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share. The most significant drive related to 2014 earnings was improved electric and natural gas margins that benefited from new rates and increased rider revenues in many of our jurisdictions. Increased margins more than offset an unfavorable weather comparison and higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. It is worth noting that the weather in 2014 contributed $0.03 per share when compared to normal. In contrast in 2013, weather contributed $0.11 per share resulting in a $0.08 per share decline when comparing the two years. Now let me provide an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. We experienced positive growth trends in 2014, with weather normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.3% and firm natural gas sales improving 4.6%. Sales in 2014 exceeded our original expectations for the year. While we are monitoring economic conditions in our service territories and are closely watching potential implications from changes in the E&P space. We remain confident in our 2015 electric weather adjusted sales growth assumption of 1%.  Let me provide a little more detail on sales growth by company. Beginning with NSP was constant, weather adjusted retail sales increased 3.3% in 2014, due to strength in C&I sales from growth in the sand mining industry and related oil and gas businesses. Customer growth and modest usage increases drove higher residential sales. Electric sales at SPS increased 2.3% driven by growth in the C&I class. Oil and gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory and we saw additional growth in uranium enrichment. While we are watching the oil price closely and expect some producers to reduce new drilling activity, we anticipate that others will continue to grow production. PSCo sales increased 1.2% which was primarily attributable to strengthen the C&I class due to a new crude manufacturing customers in energy sector growth.  Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased six-tenths of a percent driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and usage increases in the small C&I class.  Economic conditions remain strong across Xcel Energy service territories relative to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our region of 3.6% remains well below the national average of 5.4%. In addition, the number of jobs in our regions grew 2.3% during 2014 compared with 1.9% for the nation.  Focusing more specifically on 2014 earnings, ongoing electric margin increased 215 million. Key drivers included implementation of final and interim rates which increased margin by 129 million, non-fuel riders increased margin by 57 million, increased transmission investment which improved margin by 31 million and retail sales growth excluding weather improved margins by 24 million.  These positive impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable weather comparison year-over-year of 60 million as well as a few other items. The electric margin results reflect an estimated recent obligation for the Minnesota rate case which is relatively consistent with the recent ALJ recommendation and an estimated customer refund liability to capture the impact of our electric earnings test at PSCo.  Margins on the natural gas side of the business increased by 49 million for the year; this is primarily due to rate release in Colorado, significant infrastructure investment that is captured in an annual rider and retail sales growth.  O&M expenses increased 61 million or 2.7% for 2014, solidly within our original guidance of 2% to 3% increase. The increase is primarily driven by higher although moderating nuclear cost. As we have discussed in the past the key objective of our operational excellence strategic pillar is to limit O&M increases. We are reaffirming our 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2% consistent with our long-term objective. In addition I think it's worth mentioning that our 2015 O&M guidance assumption reflects a lower pension discount rate and adoption of the recently updated mortality table.  Finally other taxes increased about 45 million or 11%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota, Texas and Colorado. Next I will update you on several regulatory proceedings; additional details are included in our earnings release. In Colorado we are pleased to have reached a settlement with Hardy’s that would successfully resolve our electric rate case. The agreement continues to the productive multiyear regulatory contract that we have been operating under since 2012. The settlement cost for the total increase up about 53 million or 1.9% based on an ROE of 9.83% and an equity ratio of 56%. In addition we anticipate the PSCo will differ about 3 million of expenses in 2015.  The agreement also stipulates that both the Clean Air Clean Jobs and transmission riders are forward looking mechanisms. It is worth noting than in our original Colorado rate case we had proposed shortening the depreciable lives of certain assets, which would have led to a material increase in depreciation expense. As a result of the settlement, PSCo will not be implementing the depreciation changes and will avoid this incremental depreciation expense, alternatively we agreed to file a standalone depreciation study early next year that will be incorporated into our next rate case anticipated in 2018.  The connection is expected to rule on the settlement in the first quarter and rates are expected to become effective in mid-February. Last month we received an ALJ recommendation in our Minnesota electric case. We were encouraged by that the judge acknowledged the strength of the company’s position on many of the key issues including pension, benefits and depreciation. Including the ALJ's recommended ROE of 9.77% and adjusting for sales and property tax trip we estimate a cumulative revenue increase of about 192 million for 2014 and 2015. Deliberations are currently scheduled from March.  Turning to our Monticello prudence review, we have not yet received ALJ recommendation we believe the delay is related to workload issues for the ALJ and anticipate the ALF recommendation in February. We continue to believe that we acted prudently in making decisions throughout the course of the project, in addition to the surrounding communities and customers have a largely rebuild safe and efficient source of carbon free low cost power for many years to come. Importantly we don’t believe that the delay in receiving the ALJ’s recommendation will impact the current schedule and we continue to expect the commission to deliberate on the proceeding in March. In Texas we filed the rate case requesting an increase in annual revenues of 65 million or 6.7%. Our filing reflects the inclusion of posttest year rate base additions. One of the items we are seeking legislative support for in Texas. New rates are expected to be implemented by midyear. In South Dakota we put interim rates of our 16 million in place on January 01st and continue to walkthrough the regulatory process. Final rates are expected to be approved midyear.  We also made progress on several other initiatives during the fourth quarter. In Wisconsin, the commission approved the settlement agreement which we reached last year with staff and intervenors for rate increase of 14 million or 2.2%. Rates went into effect earlier this month. In Texas the commission approved our settlement in the 2014 rate case providing incremental revenue of 37 million or 3.5%. Rates went into effect retroactive to June 2014.  Finally in Minnesota the commission approved our gas infrastructure rider for 15 million with rates becoming effective in February 2015.  In summary 2014 was a busy and productive year for us on the regulatory front. This morning we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Please note that some of the assumptions have changed due primarily to incorporating actual 2014 results. With that I’ll wrap up my comments. After a solid 2014 we are pleased to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, our five year capital plan of $14.5 billion and our 4.7% rate based CAGR even when considering the impacts from the recently passed depreciation legislation. We continue to see improved economic conditions in our regions and experienced better than expected sales growth with 2014 weather adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.3% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.6%. We are making meaningful progress on the regulatory front, including the recent multi-year settlement in Colorado, and expect to reach a conclusion in the Minnesota’s case in the next few months. We delivered 2014 O&M expense growth within our guidance of 2% to 3% and continue to expect 2014 O&M expense to be flat to 2%. And finally we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually. So with that operator we’ll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question today from Michael Weinstein, UBS.
Michael Weinstein: Perhaps first if you can, you talked a lot about the future here, you talked about the IRP can you perhaps comment on the ability for itself to take advantage of opportunities perhaps in solar in the near term and perhaps in the long term. And perhaps also at the same time elaborate -- you introduced the comment other products and services perhaps could you elaborate a little bit on what you meant there as well.
Ben Fowke: Sure. And we’re going to add obviously as part of that the resource plan a tremendous amount of renewables both wind and solar. A lot of it comes in the ’20 through ’30 time frame. I think that gives us a great opportunity to own a good piece of those investment opportunities for couple of reasons. One, clearly technology will come down and it will most likely not have as much of the federal tax incentives that it does have now. Two, our tax appetite should grow in the coming year. So, I think we should be well positioned to take advantage of some of those opportunities. Your second question was regarding…
Michael Weinstein: I suppose you’ve made this, curious comment about offering other products and services. I am just curious if there was anything tangible?
Ben Fowke: I mean there is a number of things that we want to do. I mean increasingly customer want different energy mix. They want greener products. They want different billing options. It’s basically just responding to the trend that we’ve seen that consumers, one size that’s all which has been the traditional utility role need to change. And we want to work with our commission and their staffs to make sure that we do that in a way that’s fair to all and be flexible enough to move forward with that.
Michael Weinstein: Excellent and just if you don't mind commenting on transmission here, I would be curious, where does your transco strategy stand given some commentary from peers and the SPP market overall of perhaps a lackluster spend trajectory here at least for 2015? How does that jive with what you are baking into expectations and your own expectations for longer-term build out of the transco? And perhaps the clarification on the last question, does that mean for solar it's an opportunity for you all post the 2016 ITC? Is that what I'm hearing from you?
Ben Fowke: It means that it would be -- the opportunity improved significantly doesn’t mean we can’t do something before that. But as you know renewables are heavily driven by tax appetites and you need one to efficiently doesn’t mean you are fully precluded but to efficiently participate in those markets. Your question was about transcos and transmission. Well keep in mind that $4.5 billion of our CapEx over the next five years is in transmission, none of it is in a transco and none of it assumes that we win any of the competitive transmission projects. So when you looked at what’s come out of SSP and their ITP 10 plan I think it was about 300-odd million dollars of potential opportunities, by the way it looks like not an incident to get amount on that would go into the SPS. But we don’t have to -- that does not impact, that would be the icing on the cake. So, our strategy has always been two pronged. We have the utility vehicle to invest in, that’s where we are today. We’re in the process of getting approvals, final approvals on our transco so that we can participate in those competitive markets. I think we’re well positioned to do that. It’s gone a little bit slower as you mentioned than I think many people thought. It doesn’t really surprise us. I think there will be more opportunities in the years to come. And again I think we’ll be very well positioned to win in those markets.
Michael Weinstein: But to summarize, you feel confident in the 4.5 billion you have already delineated in executing on that despite perhaps a little bit of the lack-lusterness in SPP, et cetera?
Ben Fowke: Those by and large are identified projects so yes we feel very confident in that.
Operator: Ali Agha with SunTrust is next.
Ali Agha: Can you remind me, in your '15 guidance range right now, what kind of regulatory lag is assumed there? And best case scenario, how much of that do you think you can ultimately capture?
Teresa Madden: I mean just historically we've been writing about 100 basis points in terms of regulatory lag. And as we talked about is one of our properties is we intend to close that gap at 50 basis points. That's our target. Now if that's not evenly spread over the next year so we do intend to start to put that in place in 2015, so we are looking towards some improvements in that. It will -- the trajectory is again no ratable, but we'll move up. So it's smaller in the first year.
Ali Agha: But to be clear, you said the starting point in '15 -- I think the 2 to 2015 guidance, that is still assuming at the midpoint about 100 basis point lag?
Teresa Madden: Yes it's a little -- it's right around there. We've assumed it's a slight piece.
Ali Agha: Then my second question. As you mentioned, you ran -- weather normalized electric sales were up 1.3% in '14 ahead of perhaps your origin plan, but I noticed that for '15 you are still assuming 1% and I think for gas you're actually assuming a 2% decline, so why the slowdown in electric or what are you seeing in '15 that causes you to be more cautious?
Teresa Madden: We're just being conservative in terms of our overall outlook in terms of 2015. As we've talked to you and this goes for gas too in previous quarters, early in the year we had some extreme weather and we were always concerned. We had a little bit weather wrapped up in our overall sales, so both in the electric and gas business, so we're just being conservative Ali and saying that it's not any significant item that's driving us to keep it at that level the 1%.
Ali Agha: And then I wanted to be clear you know the comments you made that in your next Colorado gas case, you do plan to also ask to put some of your gas reserves into rate base. Can you remind us if that happens, what kind of increment rate base does that mean? And also, what is the mechanism? I was unclear, is it part of the rate case? Is it a separate filing? Just want to be clear on how this goes.
Ben Fowke: Yes I don’t know if we're actually going to talk very much about it in the actual case that we'll file to get recovery of core infrastructure investments, Ali. What I said is that we would do a concurrent filing, a separate filing that will take place most likely in the second half of this year. We're going to gather stakeholder input, understand what the important issues with our stakeholders are. Assuming those conversations and the filing goes well and I assume there'll be kind of open type meetings, then look for us to pursue a defined and more flushed out plan obviously in the 2016 timeframe. We purchased about 450 Bcf a year, so what is that, $3 that's about $1.2 billion of gas. Obviously we wouldn’t do it all, so you'd have -- you would lay into it slowly. I think with the emphasis more on our LDC business -- gas business in Colorado.
Ali Agha: Okay, but just the mechanism I mean, if it moves into rate base, you would want rate increases to reflect that. So would that be sort of put in as part of this rate case filing? Would that be a separate rate case? How would the rates be adjusted if you do get it into rate base?
Ben Fowke: It would be separate and it -- the whole premise is it's fuel for rate base and so how that mechanism would be determined there's different models out there as I think you're aware and we would -- that's the kind of input we want from stakeholders to understand what risk they're willing to bear and which risk they're not willing to bear and then we can move forward accordingly.
Ali Agha: And final question. In the past, Ben you’ve also talked about looking at opportunities where you have current BPAs and that may be expiring. Is that an opportunity to rate base some of those plants? As we look at calendar 2015, just looking at where you are in terms of contracts, et cetera, are there opportunities that could play out this year, or is this something that we should think about beyond 2015?
Ben Fowke: I mean I think there's always opportunities I mean -- and we're always looking for those opportunities to your point and so I can't promise anything, but we certainly are diligently looking at those opportunities.
Ali Agha: It could happen this year if something comes together?
Ben Fowke: It could.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI.
Greg Gordon: First question is on the Colorado rate case. How much of a depreciation increase had you initially asked for that was subsequently removed in the context of the settlement?
Teresa Madden: Greg it was north of $30 million so.
Greg Gordon: Second question is on cap spending. And I'm referring to the slides you brought to my conference a couple weeks ago. They were pretty consistent, I think, with prior disclosures. You have a $3.375 billion spend in 2015. Declines to more or less $2.8 billion in ’16, ’17, then dips a little bit in ’18, comes back up in ’19. So that averages 4.7 but it's front-end loaded. And then you have made these subsequent filings in Minnesota, specifically on resource planning. So is the bias to potentially see if you get by in Minnesota to see that ’17, ’18, ’19 spend potentially go up?
Teresa Madden: Well, maybe I will just add there in terms of the spend, why we have that peak just as a reminder Greg it’s the wind in Minnesota the two wind farms that will go in service. And so that is really the peak up. And then in terms of relative to going forward, that once rates would change, assuming they do, we should level off in terms of our relative increases. So we do have the initial peak. 
Greg Gordon: Right. I guess I am asking -- I know you are working; you have a rate plan to smooth in those increases. My question goes more towards the overall level of cap spending which declines as you get out into ’17, ’18, ’19?
Ben Fowke: Typically Greg and there are obviously no guarantee but as you know -- as we get into those out years the actual spend has historically tended to increase as we identify new opportunities or new needs within our spending parameters. And I think you also were asking about the resource plan itself that we found, and as I said I think that could create some opportunities for us albeit most of them would be in the later part of that five year forecast or even outside of that five year forecast.
Greg Gordon: Got you. So when we think about your 5% to 7% growth aspiration, this plan drives slightly less in terms of rate-based growth, and then improving regulatory lag to inside the range. But should you, in fact, identify more cap spending than that whole sort of calculus just moves up a bit.
Teresa Madden: We've tempered back the 5 to 7 to be closer to around 5% rate base growth as we look forward, so it’s a little bit lower than the 5 to 7 in past years I talked about. 
Ben Fowke: So we always look for rate based opportunities Greg, to your point and also to your point the thing that will really drive earnings is closing that ROE gap, as Teresa mentioned. I think we are making good progress on that, and we're excited about continuing what has been a good deal for customers and shareholders in Colorado and I am encouraged with the progress we are making here in Minnesota. 
Greg Gordon: Great. And then the final question is last year you raised the dividend first quarter, whereas in prior years you had raised it later in the year. What is your expectation of the current dividend cycle to this year and going forward? 
Ben Fowke: Yes, we addressed that with the Board and so that you probably can assume that last year’s cycle will be more consistent going forward. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller : Hi. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the impact on you guys from the oil price drop and how that might be incorporated or not in that 1% demand forecast, anything around that that would have a material impact?
Ben Fowke: I guess, let me start and I will let Teresa add if she thinks I have missed anything. One as Teresa we have got a 1% is probably all things equal fairly conservative sales forecast. So we have margin, reserve margin, if you will, but actually we don’t really see much in the way of we do sales coming out of the decline in oil prices, and to the extent we do keep in mind that, that is probably the lowest margin part of our business. So, I don’t think it’s a big impact Travis, really don’t and we don’t think it’s going to be a big impact on our capital expanding profile either. 
Travis Miller : Okay. Great. And then one on the Colorado case, on the electric side. How much given though the adjustments you were able to get out of the Clean Air Clean Jobs, and the transmission into riders and such, how much now, give us a sense on a percentage basis or idea, is subject to demand? Demand sensitive in terms of earning ROE?
Teresa Madden: In terms of just a sales growth?
Travis Miller : Yes, needing sales growth to compensate for the net capital investment that you guys would see over this three-year period.
Teresa Madden: I think it’s very moderate in terms of that, because those were our biggest drivers in terms of that cost recovery and having those mechanisms in place. We are definitely predicting sales growth but it’s not dependent in terms of earning our ROE on having an aggressive sales growth achievement. 
Ben Fowke: I would agree with that what Teresa said, I mean, of course the riders help with the incremental but I mean you got your core business, so sales growth is always an issue. But I think we have that reasonably paid and to Teresa’s point we are not assuming an aggressive sales forecast in those numbers. 
Operator: Next is Chris Turnure, JPMorgan.
Chris Turnure: Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the e21 initiative. You mentioned that you came out with the initial blueprint back in December and then you actually filed with the MPEC this month for a specific rider mechanism of some kind. You were a little bit high level with the description there. I wanted to find out a little bit more in the way of detail and find out more in the way of timing. And then also I wanted to understand the interplay between that request and then the fact that you have kind of bundled in some futuristic carbon goals as well. How do those two relate within that request?
Ben Fowke: I guess to try to answer that it’s all about having a longer term approach to what we're trying to accomplish in Minnesota. So, the resource plan we went out further here is what we can do by 2030 here is how we get there. Let’s focus on the key objective which is carbon reduction, must be very disciplined about how we achieve that carbon reduction using what we like to call technologies at the speed of value. So disciplined on how we approach it. And let’s make sure that our regulatory compact reflects that longer view. So yes we outlined general frameworks but generally what we’re looking for is longer term regulatory compacts. We like to see compacts three, four maybe even out to five years long. And within that things you can augment that with writers, you could use formulaic recovery type mechanisms and then have the incentives for achieving what I think the state wants us to achieve. So we less deliberately beg but we’re building off that e21 initiative which we participated in but we didn’t drive. So I really think there is an excitement here in Minnesota as we’ve outlined these plans and talked about how we can achieve these carbon reduction goals at a very-very modest price to consumers. So more to come on that but I think it’s a pretty exciting time.
Teresa Madden: Maybe just to add to that I mean and just to clarify Ben outlined the framework but I think you mentioned that we had made a rider request, we haven’t specifically done that, so just to add to Ben’s comment in terms of the overall framework.
Chris Turnure: Okay. Got you. So nothing specific with a rider request and then just stepping back, overall this is more driven by future growth, future spending, demands and initiatives, and then those are going to potentially necessitate some kind of rider or catch-up mechanism to compensate you for that?
Ben Fowke: There is different ways you can get there. So the point is that we’re moving to a different environment and we’re going to need the regulatory compact to evolve with it. And so the key takeaway I hope we it is that what we’re really seeking is a more comprehensive multiyear approach.
Chris Turnure: Okay. And then do you guys have any color around initial conversations there with regulators and then, separately, in either Minnesota or in Texas, initial conversations with policy makers and the timing around your legislative initiatives in both those states?
Ben Fowke: Well, let me just say that, I’ve had opportunity as have others on the Xcel team to talk about what we’re trying to accomplish. And as I mentioned I think there is a lot of excitement and I think there is -- the devil is always in the details as you know. But I think there is a lot of excitement that this is a way we ought to be going as a state. So that’s from a regulatory perspective. We like to potentially have legislation that would support that new regulatory framework in Minnesota. So, more to come on that obviously.  In Texas I think we’re getting some traction it’s still little bit early days they haven’t even assigned - made committee assignments to the key committees that would drive legislation for us. But we haven’t seen any major road blocks at this point.
Operator: At this time, we’ll take the question from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold: Quick one, you mentioned exploring ways to avoid a 2016 Minnesota rate case. Could you elaborate?
Ben Fowke: Let me take a stab at it. I mean first of all where there is a will there is a way. And I think as I’ve said there is really a will to let’s get to 2016 case out of the way and let’s focus on this longer term framework. So how we do that mechanically? Well, it starts with using the ALJ recommendations, getting our interim rate proposal adopted close to what we’ve proposed and then taking a look at our excess depreciation and maybe reshaping that a bit along with using some of our nuclear depreciation as well. So, there is a way Jonathan and it would be nice to free up the time so we could spend time on these other more longer term ideas that the community and we have.
Jonathan Arnold: It sounds like you might be reasonably well along with having getting that done? Is that fair?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think the first step in getting it done was a constructive ALJ settlement. So we've got something to work with now and then again if parties want to do it, I think we've got the pathway forward.
Jonathan Arnold: And then still another topic, the gas rate basing subject. How -- given the change in the commodity price, obviously it would seem interesting for some of your stakeholders to lock that in. How confident are you that you will be able to find the other side of the deal?
Ben Fowke: There's definitely an economic benefit to moving forward especially where gas prices are today, but we have to make sure that -- there'll be a lot of concerns. I mean this won't be an easy lift. But I think the economics are compelling enough that I would -- that I have optimism that ultimately we can get something done, but it's going to take time Jon.
Jonathan Arnold: My question was a bit more to the appetite -- you see appetite from producers to lock in these prices?
Ben Fowke: Well I mean that's -- yes, I think you can find the producers, that's not going to be an issue.
Jonathan Arnold: You're more focused on your side?
Ben Fowke: Yes, right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next we hear from Ashar Khan, Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan: Teresa can you -- you mentioned the bonus appreciation, what is the cash flow impact?
Teresa Madden: Well the bonus appreciation I mean for basically the extension and.
Ashar Khan: Yes.
Teresa Madden: It's a combination, it's about 1.8 billion and it's [indiscernible] between the two years about 1.4 billion in '14 and about 400 million in '15 because we have some carry over.
Ashar Khan: So that's extra cash you'll get.
Teresa Madden: Well that's the bonus depreciation amount so that's a tax impact on that so.
Ashar Khan: So I can take that number and do a tax impact on that.
Teresa Madden: Yes.
Ashar Khan: And so is that now factored in into your -- I guess how does that help? Does that lower debt needs or how is that cash being used in the process?
Teresa Madden: Well we've factored into our overall guidance in terms of the effects of the bonus depreciation so we've taken that all into account. To the extent we have that, we also have some rate base offsets, so it's a combination, but we've factored that all into our 2015 guidance and our updates.
Ben Fowke: One thing you'll note Ashar is that we have reduced our debt plan debt issuance over the five year time period. The other thing is obviously some [indiscernible] depreciation comes in NOL and push forward because you can only utilize so much of it per year. So it's had a modest improvement in our cash flow needs or our financing needs.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. And at this time I will turn the conference over to Teresa Madden for any closing or additional remarks.
Teresa Madden: Well thank you for all participating in our earnings call this morning and please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow up questions. Thanks again.
Ben Fowke : Thank you everyone.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, discuss our strategic plans, update you on recent business developments and regulatory developments, discuss our 2014 and 2015 guidance, and our updated capital plan. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. In addition, we will post a brief video on our website of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm going start by highlighting some of the key takeaways from the quarter, and then Teresa will provide more details on some of these items. Overall, we had a solid quarter with ongoing earnings of $0.73 per share, compared with $0.77 per share last year. Weather was the biggest driver for the quarter, with an adverse impact of $0.07 per share. Based on our year-to-date performance, we're on track to achieve our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance, and we're tightening our range to $1.95 to $2.05 per share. In addition, we are positioned to meet our objective of limiting O&M increases to 2% to 3% for 2014. We are also introducing our 2015 EPS guidance range of $2 to $2.15 per share, solidly within our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. We're also providing you with our new 5-year capital plan, which totals $14.5 billion. Our updated capital forecast drives rate-based growth by about 4.7% using 2014 as the new base. So with 9 months of 2014 completed, we are on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. Beyond 2014, we are confident that our strategic plan will continue to grow EPS and our dividend at 4% to 6% annually. And that plan begins with a robust capital investment program coupled with an improving regulatory environment. Today, as you know, we're not currently earning our authorized ROEs. This is especially true in NSP-Minnesota and SPS. We believe we can close that gap over the next several years. To this end, we are formally introducing a goal of reducing overall regulatory lag by 50 basis points by 2018. In addition, we're establishing a goal of deriving 75% of our revenue from multi-year plans by 2017. So in Minnesota, along with working to resolve the current rate case, we are collaborating with stakeholders on ideas for a longer term, more performance-based rate compact, and we're discussing alternatives to filing a 2016 rate case. And we're looking ahead to the legislative session when some of these ideas may surface. At SPS, we're working with stakeholders and planning to introduce legislation that would reduce regulatory lag and allow us to continue to make investments that will support the tremendous growth we're experiencing in the region. We continue to make significant investments at SPS, and we are planning to file a Texas retail rate case in December of this year. While constructive regulatory frameworks are important keys to our success, we also recognize that we need to diligently manage our cost. Our O&M objective is to keep our cost increases in line with expected sales growth. Now, this will be achieved by continued standardization and streamlining of our work processes. We made significant improvements in the last few years, and we're beginning to reap those results. We're also implementing new systems that will leverage and expand those results while also meeting both the challenge and the opportunity associated with transitioning a retiring workforce. Those efforts, combined with stabilization of nuclear and pension costs will position us well to limit O&M increases to 0% to 2% annually. I also believe we have some upside opportunity to expand our capital investments beyond the $14.5 billion we just announced. We have fantastic opportunities right in our backyard and I've challenged my team to pursue them. Look for us to expand our regional presence in the disciplined and thoughtful manner you've come to expect from us. Our plans focus on transmission and natural gas. We have extensive experience in these areas and both offer the opportunity for placing assets under federal regulation. With respect to transmission, we've recently achieved milestones in the development of our transcos with the filing of our federal applications. At the same time, we are pursuing new projects through our operating companies in states that offer a right of first refusal or other favorable frameworks. This 2-pronged strategy gives us the flexibility to pursue projects in a way that makes the most sense for the situation offering advantages as we compete for the right to construct under FERC Order 1000. While we're in the early days of pursuing growth in natural gas, we see great opportunities for new infrastructure and increased use of our existing assets. We have a solid track record in our natural gas business that we plan to leverage and expand. Look for us to build natural gas infrastructure in our regions and consider new upstream investments. In addition, we are preparing to explore with our regulators the possibility of rate-basing natural gas reserves to take advantage of the current low prices for our customers, while also creating a new investment opportunity. So in addition to being on track for the year, we have plans in place to deliver solid earnings growth for the years ahead. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. We're pleased to report another solid quarter with ongoing earnings of $0.73 per share, compared with 2013 third quarter earnings of $0.77 per share. The biggest driver of the difference was weather. 2013 third quarter results included a positive weather impact of about $0.05 per share, compared with cooler-than-normal weather in 2014 that resulted in a negative impact of $0.02 per share. Other drivers include improved electric and gas margins resulting from rate filings in several jurisdictions, as well as higher rider revenues. Partial offsets were higher property taxes and depreciation expense. These cost increases were expected and are consistent with our financial plans. Let me start by providing an update on sales in the economies in our local service territories. We continue to experience positive year-to-date sales trends with weather-normalized retail electric sales increasing 1.4% and firm natural gas sales up 4.8% through September. While the third quarter had some variations, year-to-date sales continued to exceed our original expectations for the year. Let me provide a little more detail on the sales growth by company. Beginning with SPS, year-to-date weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 2.3%, driven by growth in the C&I class. Oil and Gas exploration in the Permian Basin continues to benefit the service territory. Sales at NSP-Wisconsin increased 3.3%, due to strength in the C&I sales that resulted from a large pipeline customer that has been operating at full capacity this year and continued growth in the sand mining industry. PSCo sales increased 1.3%, which was primarily attributable to strength in the C&I class resulting from a new food manufacturing company and growth in the energy sector. Finally, NSP-Minnesota sales increased 0.7%, driven by growth in the number of residential and small C&I customers and increased usage by the small C&I class. Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 3.7% remains well below the national average of 5.7%. In addition, the number of jobs in our region grew 2.3% year-to-date, compared with 1.9% for the nation. We are pleased with the better-than-expected sales growth but continue to maintain a relatively conservative forecast and are assuming electric weather-adjusted sales growth of about 1% for both 2014 and 2015. Focusing more specifically on third quarter earnings. Ongoing electric margin increased $8 million for the quarter. Key drivers included: implementation of final and interim rates, which increased margin by $39 million; nonfuel riders increased margin by $13 million; and improved wholesale results increased margin by $7 million. These positive factors were partially offset by an unfavorable quarterly weather variance of $56 million as well as other items. The electric margin results reflect an estimated reserve for the Minnesota rate case and an estimated customer refund liability, to capture the impact of sharing earnings above the authorized ROE at PSCo. Turning to the natural gas side of the business. Margin increased by $8 million. This was largely due to revenue from our pipeline integrity rider, which is designed to recover our ongoing gas infrastructure investment. O&M expenses decreased $7 million or 1.2%, primarily driven by lower employee benefit costs and moderating nuclear costs. For the year, O&M is up 2.8% within our original guidance assumption of an increase of 2% to 3%. It is worth noting that O&M was highest in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to incremental spending on our system after a hot summer. As a result, we expect that our 2014 fourth quarter O&M will come in lower than last year. More importantly, we're introducing 2015 O&M guidance of 0% to 2%, consistent with our long-term objective. Finally, other taxes increased about $13 million or 12%, largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. Next, I'll comment on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Minnesota, we completed hearings for our electric rate case in August and successfully narrowed the differences on several key issues between the company and the Department of Commerce, the primary intervener. The important takeaway is that we continue to make progress and have limited the material remaining issues to ROE, certain labor and benefit expenses, as well as depreciation expense in 2015. As a result, we have revised our 2-year request to $248 million. The remaining key dates are the ALJ report due in late December, with deliberations and a commission decision scheduled for March of 2015. We also completed hearings in the Monticello Prudence Review and believe that we presented a strong case focused on key things, including the investment was prudent, it was essential that the work be done right, and we made reasonable decisions during the course of the project. Importantly, the surrounding communities and our customers have a largely rebuilt, safe, and efficient source of carbon-free, low-cost power for many years to come. We look forward to the ALJ's order in late December with deliberations and a commission decision scheduled for March of next year. We remain confident that we will reach a constructive outcome in both the Minnesota rate case and the Monticello Prudence Review. In our Colorado electric rate case, we're seeking an increase in annual revenue of approximately $136 million or 4.8%. In addition, we have introduced a Clean Air-Clean Jobs investment rider that would cover 2016 and 2017. Our objective is to establish a multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customers. Key dates are staff and intervener testimony on November 7, rebuttal testimony on December 17, hearings in late January, and interim rates will be effective in mid-February with a final commission decision in the second quarter of 2015. In Texas, we reached a settlement, which will increase annual revenue by $37 million or 3.5%. The Texas commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year. In Wisconsin, we reached an agreement with the commission staff that resolved all contested issues and provides for a revenue increase of $16 million. ROE, capital structure and rate base are not issues that were being considered in this case. We expect a final commission order by year end. It is still early in the South Dakota rate case process, and there is no news to report. However, we continue to anticipate resolution early next year. Finally, as we continue to invest in reliability and new infrastructure in our Colorado gas business, it is important that we recover these investments in a timely manner. As a result, we are planning to file a natural gas case early next year. This morning, we are narrowing our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance to $1.95 to $2.05 per share and are introducing our 2015 earnings guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share. Our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release, including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. It is worth noting that our 2015 guidance assumptions include sales growth of about 1% and O&M growth of 0% to 2%. In addition, we are introducing our refreshed 5-year capital base plan of $14.5 billion, an increase of $400 million from our last plan. Our capital forecast includes $4.5 billion for transmission investment, which has a high level of certainty. This base plan drives an overall rate base compound average growth rate of about 4.7% from 2014 to 2019. Our projected transmission investment drives rate-based growth of about 10% during this 5-year period. It is important to note, as Ben indicated, that our forecast doesn't include any potential incremental growth investments in natural gas assets and does not assume success in any competitive transmission RFPs that are expected to be issued over the next 5 years. On the financing front, we recently amended our credit facilities. While the basic terms and conditions didn't materially change, we extended the maturity until 2019 and increased the overall borrowing limits by $300 million to $2.75 billion. Looking forward, we are planning to issue $1.85 billion of debt in 2015. We have debt issuances planned for each operating company and at the holding company. The details are included in our earnings release. As a reminder, we don't plan to issue any equity beyond our DRIP and benefit plan through 2019. Finally, we are pleased with the recently approved 10-year franchise agreement and the Clean Energy partnership with the city of Minneapolis. These agreements enhance our long-standing partnership with the city and demonstrate our commitment to environmental leadership by providing our customers with more options. With that, I'll wrap up my comments. With 2014 coming to a close, we're pleased to narrow our guidance range and are on track to deliver earnings within our range for the 10th consecutive year. Our 2015 guidance of $2 to $2.15 per share is solidly within our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth objective and is supported by our $14.5 billion capital plan. We continue to experience better-than-expected sales growth with year-to-date weather-adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.4% and weather-adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 4.8%. We are making progress on the regulatory front and expect to reach constructive outcomes in our major jurisdictions in the coming months. We continue to expect 2014 O&M expense to grow 2% to 3% and 2015 O&M to be flat to up to 2%, consistent with our original guidance assumptions. And finally, we are well positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value to our shareholders by growing earnings and our dividend, 4% to 6% annually. So operator, with that, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Ben, I just wanted to follow-up here, firstly on the oil and gas side, if you could expand a little bit. What service territories would this potentially include and how big of a program are we talking about? Just, if you can give us little bit of a sense here with the timeline and magnitude?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, it's really, we're -- this is Ben, Julien. We are focused in our footprint. As you know, we're on the periphery of the Dakotas in the Bakken, and we're well on the oil patch in New Mexico and Texas and, of course, there's the DJ in Colorado. So all of those have infrastructure needs. We're focused on the gas side, we're focused on the ability to work our existing assets, harder than we work them today and being more of a regional player. And as I said on the call, it's early days. So really what I've asked my team to do is just explore those possibilities, be more proactive, try to leverage our buying power. We buy about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of natural gas every year. So I think there's opportunities there, and we're going to look for them. None of that's in our forecast, as Teresa mentioned.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right, absolutely. And then secondly, going back to Minnesota, if you don't mind, on the rate recovery potential, I mean, could you elaborate a little bit more on the timeline and ultimately what kinds of mechanisms you'd specifically be looking forward to improve the construct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: You mean with the alternatives that we're talking about?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, exactly, just kind of lay out the timeline for each one, to what extent one might impact the other, just from an implementation time perspective?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think they're wrapped around, moving to a longer multi-year compact, recognizing that the peak for our investment cycle is in 2015 and then it starts to -- the need for a rate release starts to levelize off. So the longer the rate pact -- compact, the more we can implement rate mitigation tools that would smooth that impact. So -- I mean that would be the focus along with discussing longer term with the commission, the overall policy goals that the state has, particularly on environmental side along with some opportunities that we have we believe that you could be more creative and drive value both for customers and reduce rates and also value for the shareholders. So -- and as you might know, Julien, there is work groups, the E21 work team for example, in Minnesota that are looking at the same thing. We've got these goals in the future, and our utility, Xcel Energy, needs to play a big part of that, and, of course, alternative regulation then is a natural byproduct of that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Absolutely. And then lastly, could you elaborate a little bit on logo [ph] trends and what we could see out of the IRP in, I suppose, early next year? I'm kind of thinking here about the decision with Black Dog to kind of kick that down the road a little bit? What's the thought process?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean, I think -- I mean the last thing you want to do is throw a party and nobody comes, right? So we're seeing an increase in sales, but, I mean, the fact of the matter is, if you look at plans for solar and other aspects of our business, you want to be careful about adding anymore generation to your system and we're just saying that needs to be pushed out, and we need to be thoughtful about it. And we're in good shape today. And so -- so Black Dog is still on the table as are the other programs, but increasingly it looks like it's further out in the future.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. No real surprises out of the IRP in many regards?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: No. No real surprises. And of course, everybody, including us, is waiting for the final EPA rules to come out too, so there is a lot of things that are swirling around, and I think time is on our side to get clarity on those things.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Ben or Teresa, I mean, putting the context, the 50-basis-point improvement challenge that you've given the team. Give us some context in terms of, as we stand here today, how big is the regulatory lag in your system and also remind us that 50-basis-point improvement would have equate to how much in terms of incremental earnings on an annual basis?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, sure. Ali, we generally are running at a 75 to 100 basis points in terms of the GAAP, and as you know that it varies by company. If we would achieve or assuming when we ultimately, because it is our target to achieve the 50 basis points, it could improve our earnings growth by about 75 to 80 basis points.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Because, as you point out, the target on the rate base is 4.7%. So to get higher or even to the higher end of your range, obviously, regulatory lag reduction has to be a key component mathematically to get there?
Teresa S. Madden: And that's exactly why we're focusing on that. So..
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Yes. Second question on load growth. If I look at the trend that you've reported to us for Xcel as a whole, weather-normalized, there's been actually a slowing down in the growth rate in each of the last 3 quarters, 2% in the first quarter, 1.4% and now 0.9%. Can you talk a little bit more about that in terms of what's happening to cause that load growth to slow down, as we've gone through the year?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, Ali, why don't I start and then Ben can jump in. I mean, early, if we focus first on '14, and we talked about this before early in the year, we had extreme cold weather, and we're concerned that early on in our weather-normalized growth that we potentially have still a little weather trapped in there. We all know that, that process of estimating is not perfect. If we look at this quarter in terms of the electric residential, it looks like we have declines in 3 of our 4 systems. If we go to last year, we had very hot weather when we picked up the $0.05, and we think potentially in that period we had some weather potentially trapped in our weather-normalized growth. So when we look at them period-over-period, we think that's partly driving those declines in the quarter. So long and the short of it, we're seeing some weather variations that we think could be causing this, but if we turn to our electric and commercial and industrial growth, we see that still as very solid across our system. And it's different reasons for each system.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Ali, I would just -- I think Teresa captured it, I mean I think you have to focus on year-to-date and year-to-date is ahead of our expectations. We're also seeing what we believe is household formation in both Minnesota and Colorado, and we saw customer growth of just under 1%. So I mean that's a really good trend in our minds. So again, I think, we're in good shape with sales. I mean, sales -- it's a different world, obviously, than where we would have been a decade ago, but good customer growth, good economies, diversified economies that all bodes well for the future, I believe.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And then, Ben, your comment about focusing more on the gas side of the business and looking for growth there. Would that also include potential acquisitions of other LDCs out there that may be complementary to your system? Is that one of the strategies as well?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, we don't really comment on M&A and what I would tell you is that things are pretty pricy out there. So I think it's -- the team is going to focus on what I would call taking our organic presence, what we have, our growth, our customer needs and trying to make sure that we work those opportunities harder. And so, you're looking at pipelines, you're looking at storage, you're looking at what's happening in our region as coal plants retire and get closed and gas plants get built. Those are the kinds of opportunities that, I think, will drive value for us, Ali. And again, we're going to be very disciplined about it. I mean, we've got $14.5 billion of identified opportunities, so we can be pretty picky.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: My last question, Ben, on the Minnesota rate case. When you look at where the differences currently lie between where you are and where the UC [ph] is right now, can you just quantify for us how much dollar terms are those differences and if you took ROE out of the equation, how much of a gap that would equate to?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think, we've narrowed the gap and, as Teresa mentioned, it's just in a few areas now that we've got differences in labor and pension and sales.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, I mean, they're not significant. Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean I think it's important to recognize that while we have a sales difference that we've got a true-up mechanism, so it's pretty neutral.
Paul A. Johnson: And Ali, there is a schedule in the earnings release that details our position and the DOC position by line, so you can look through that.
Operator: And next, we'll move on to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: I actually have just one question. So given the formulaic nature of your ROE in Minnesota and the fact that the rate case is still pending and that the 10-year treasury yield is again below 2.3%, are we risking yet another downward adjustment to the ROE?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, I think the testimony has all been filed. So I think the opportunities to reopen that are pretty limited, and I'm looking at my regulatory team, they're nodding their heads, yes. That is true.
Teresa S. Madden: So they're downward, really the 9.64.
Unknown Executive: And it's also been briefed. So we're pretty well down that schedule.
Operator: And next we'll move on to Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could discuss a little bit about how any kind of political changes next week might affect pending regulations, pending programs that you're looking at in several states. Just anything along those lines that might be material depending on outcomes in your 2 states?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: There's an election? There's an election happening next week? [indiscernible] In all seriousness, we've got some pretty tight elections, the race for governor in Colorado is pretty tight. If the Republican candidate wins, probably we could anticipate some changes to the commission. Nothing near term. The other thing that we will look for in Colorado is, it's possible that the Senate, which is now Democratic might go Republican. And if that happens, of course, you just -- any legislation that comes out would be more bi partisan. In Minnesota, I don't think it's too much of an election as far the governor's races goes, but it is possible that the House could go Republican, and again that would impact any kind of legislation that comes out again it will be more bi partisan in nature. Clearly, there's some big Senate races, particularly in Colorado. But by and large, I don't think you would see any immediate impacts. As you know, we -- I think we have got a great track record of working with both sides of the isle.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Sure. Can you remind me what's the Colorado regulatory commission turnover or that relationship there with the governor that you mentioned?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Okay. Well, you mean -- there's 3 commissions. The governor gets to report those. Are you talking about Colorado, Travis?
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Colorado, yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. And so you have a Republican in Vod [ph] and then you have 2 Democrats. And I don't -- Dave or Scott, I don't think either of them are up for election and Vod, potentially has some confirmation issues but that would be about it.
Unknown Executive: Commissioner Powell would be the next commissioner up in '15.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: In '15?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I guess my first question is, if you take the 4.7% and the opportunities that are not included in that, what do you think the 4.7% could move to? Could it move up 100 basis points? Or just -- what type of incremental do you see as potential opportunity?
Teresa S. Madden: Paul, at this point, I think it's just early on. We are just starting to investigate and pursue these. So I think it would be premature for us to give a number at this point, but we clearly do think there is opportunity.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, there was a recent piece out by Moody's on rates. And, I guess, also in the AEP earnings call, they indicated that they had looked pretty hard at our REIT structure, and I think they elaborated a number of obstacles or problems that they found with the structure. Have you guys taken a look at REITs and come to any conclusions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think, we're a little bit more early days on those sorts of things. We are interested in any structure that could be a win for customers and shareholders, but our focus right now is primarily on getting those transcos formed and making sure that we obtain rights to build the transmission that, that's in our region, either through the opco structure or transco structure. Where it goes from there is way early for us.
Teresa S. Madden: That's right. I mean, we would agree that REIT structure is complex and the first step is getting the transcos up, off the ground.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And then my last question. You've talked about dividend growth of 4% to 6%, EPS growth of 4% to 6%. I think previously you talked about sort of a targeted shareholder return level of 10%. Is that 10% still part of your broad target?
Teresa S. Madden: That's been a while since we talked about the 10%, we just -- we, overall, think, we provide an attractive return to our shareholders. But it's been a while since we've been, probably about 18 months or even past on that about...
Unknown Executive: It's been a couple of years, Paul. I mean, obviously, if the stock prices moved up the dividend yield has declined, which makes it a little bit more difficult to get to a 10% total return based on 4% to 6% growth. So it's really more of a math situation.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you talk a little about the nature of deciding to pull forward some CapEx or at least increase CapEx in the near term in '15 and '16, in particular, and what was behind that? And then also, could you give us a little bit more granularity, if you could, on catching up on lag? You mentioned that the 50 basis points is your goal by 2018. But kind of how do we get from here to there? Is it lumpy? Is it consistent? What are we looking for?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Let me take the -- that second question. I will let Teresa address the first. I mean, the -- it's going to be more. It's not going to be next year. It takes time for these things to get traction. But you get the traction by having multi-year plans in place and we want to have all of our major jurisdictions with multi-year compacts in place and then disciplined cost control. And if you put those 2 together, and I think, we've got both of those in motion, then you're going to reduce regulatory lags significantly, and that's really what the plan is.
Teresa S. Madden: In terms of just variations in the near term, we have increased our estimates in terms of electric and distribution, investment spend, and some of that is really been driven by higher levels of new customer growth. So those are the primary variations.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then my follow-up is on the Minnesota cases for next year. You have a $0.15 range in your EPS guidance. I understand that some of that range is going to be due to Minnesota, obviously. It's not just a point estimate that you have internally. Could you give us any kind of indication that would allow us to figure out the EPS change that's attributable to that alone?
Teresa S. Madden: [indiscernible] I think it'd be better to say, it's not just the Minnesota because Colorado we also have a pending case that's relatively large there. So between the 2 of them, that's creating the range. So I think we would just prefer to leave it at that for right now.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. But the range is -- or the bulk of the range can be attributed to regulatory situations?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: My question is who's worse, the Vikings or the Jets?
Unknown Executive: Oh, it has to be the Jets, for sure.
Unknown Executive: You will see that on December 7, by the way.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, we'll actually find out the answer to that question, won't we? The...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Greg, I wanted to tell you, I really enjoyed you morning joke, by the way.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: The -- my question is on the dividend. I know that you raise the dividend above the long term 4% to 6% aspiration earlier this year. Your payout ratio is still below, what I would consider, the peer group average, although, obviously, you could slot different companies in and out of that. And your cash flow profile looks pretty good relative to the way you've portrayed it in your -- even in your updated release today. Is there still a possibility over the next several years that we might get one or more sort of out of trend line dividend increases as you try to move back to an industry average payout?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, I -- the objective is a long-term objective. So you can always have some lumpiness. And we recognize we have financial flexibility, Greg. But I really think when you do your modeling, you ought to just stick with what we're telling you and it's 4% to 6%.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes. I agree.
Operator: And next we'll go onto Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Your $14.5 billion does not include net gas reserves or FERC 1000 opportunity, correct?
Teresa S. Madden: That's correct.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And what do you have in there as far as place holder for EPA regs yet to be determined?
Teresa S. Madden: We don't have -- I mean, in the left -- in the end of the period, we do have some dollars, but not for investment spend depending on how those rules come out.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. I mean, I think, that said, we've been working an environmental plan with our states. Clean Air, Clean Jobs is a great example of that. So we'd have been kind of planning for these regulations in our CapEx. Fundamental CapEx reflects the fact that we're moving to a more carbon-light world. In fact, as you know, we have reduced carbon from an '05 baseline by 30%, by 2020.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What's your annual net gas procurement? And what percent might you want to have locked in through reserves?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think, we -- between the LDC and the electric operations, it's somewhere around 400 BCF.
Teresa S. Madden: That's correct.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: So you can do the math on that. As far as what we would want to see, I mean, that's too early to tell. I mean, I think if you can smooth volatility, if you can lock in good pricing, if the commission get comfortable with the approach, we'll do as much as they would like to see us do, and we'll do as little as they want to see us to do as well. But I think, it's -- I think the pricing and timing is pretty opportunistic right now. So we want to definitely have those conversations.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Where are you in that conversation? Has it started yet or just very preliminary?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, we're beginning -- I would say preliminary would be -- is how I would categorize it.
Operator: And next we'll move on to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. One on Colorado. I'm struggling a little bit to understand the electric rate case process, really. In your electric rate case increase request, and meshing that with what's happening in the annual earnings test. Meaning you've given the $46 million refund obligation from the 2013 test and now you're recognizing an estimate or an accrual for $52 million. It almost seems that -- and maybe I'm misunderstanding it or maybe it's just due to something like what, abnormal weather, but it almost seems like you're earning a pretty good return there and even above authorized, according to these earnings tests. And yet, you're coming in and asking for a decent-sized rate increase to go along with that. Help me kind of true those up, if you don't mind.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I would. Teresa, help me out here. But there's 2 key drivers to why we are filing the rate case. It's the capital recovery of the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act and there's property taxes. So those are -- and part of that is, I think, a reversal of some things we've been deferring under the multi-year plan that we're under. So those are the 2 drivers, Michael. And if we can get those -- that recovery, then I think we can be positioned to do a settlement.
Teresa S. Madden: Right. I mean, Michael, when you think about the timing of the infrastructure build in Colorado, I mean, it's in the process of being completed, and it has to be done by 2017, so it's going in service. So therefore, we need the rate increase up to this point. We've have had AFUDC offsets, so that's causing the driver, and just as Ben indicated, along with property taxes.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And speaking of property taxes, you talked about a very -- in your 2015 guidance, about a sizable increase, almost $80 million at the mid-point and property taxes. Where is the bulk of that happening? I mean, that's like a 15% year-over-year increase.
Teresa S. Madden: Well it's exactly what Ben was talking about in the -- 2012 through '14 settlements in Colorado. We had a mechanism where we deferred and then we were starting to amortize. But it's every year -- we start an amortization just 3 years, so the numbers have grown, and we're seeing a peak in that. So that, again, is driving that -- one of the drivers of that rate increase.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Along with just increased rate base and the associated taxes that go with that. So you get a -- it's a twofold-type thing.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. But it's not just -- I mean, Colorado has got the reversal of the amortization, but the other jurisdictions just kind of have a normal taxes of an income tax and property tax growth rate?
Teresa S. Madden: Right. Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And finally, in the Minnesota rate case, I mean, we're in late October right now, last to -- second to last day. How much -- if I remember correctly, so you asked for roughly $142 million for 2014. How much of that is already in rates? So if they give you the $140 million -- $142 million for 2014, what's the real step up versus what's actually in rates today?
Teresa S. Madden: What's in rates right now is we are collecting at the interim rate level, it's actually $127 million. So, I mean, we've gone through and assessed where we think we are at on the various issues and basically -- and set up some reserves related to that. But it's still early because we are not done with the case.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But if you get the $142 million, what it effectively means is it's a $15 million step up from what's currently, and effectively, the run rate you've had in revenues in Minnesota year-to-date?
Teresa S. Madden: I'm not sure I am quite following your question, Michael.
Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I can -- I'll follow-up with Paul offline.
Unknown Executive: I think -- Is he talking about the '15 step in? Well, anyway we'll follow-up.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Okay. So...
Operator: And next we will move on to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: So I have a couple of questions. First on the 50 basis point ROE improvement that you're targeting. Is that something that we should consider as part of your 4% to 6% growth plan? And to achieve that? Or is that something that could allow you to do better?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, as Teresa said it's 75 to 80 basis points. And -- so that's certainly is going to -- all things equal, would move us up, if you combine that with the rate base.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Right. And then the other target in terms of kind of the multi-year plan. Can you repeat, Ben, specifically what your objective there is? And when we think about Minnesota, just -- is this something that could be resolved within the context of the current case? Or is it -- you had mentioned something about legislation. So I'm trying to kind of understand like the timeline for -- I know we have a 2-year plan, potentially, in Minnesota, but it seemed like you were talking even more than that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. I mean, I -- well, first of all, the goal would be to continue the multi-year approach in Colorado. Then in Minnesota, to work with the commission to go into a longer-term plan. We do believe we have some flexibility to go longer. And the legislative side of that, that I mentioned would be to provide the commission some additional support and guidance, and also take that broader approach to where the state wants to head as far as its own energy policy, so that -- does that give you some...
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: No, that's helpful. I guess, my question then would be, is that something that can be done in time by the legislature in context of this current pending case or something kind of later on?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think you could introduce it as part of the -- when the commission hears this current case. So it's not directly related, but it can be correlated, if you will.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, okay. And then just in the -- one thing that has been an improvement from when you laid out this plan last year is the -- I think you have a reduced amount of equity issuance?
Teresa S. Madden: Correct.
Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC: Than you had. So in the context of your 4% to 6% and the like, is that -- I mean, that -- maybe that just changed you within the range, but is there offsets to that, that are negatives that you still in the 4% to 6%? Or -- it didn't really seem to kind of change you within that range, I guess, is my question, so.
Teresa S. Madden: I mean, I would say, it keeps us within the range. I don't think there's necessarily offsets that you're suggesting.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean, as we -- look, we do everything we can to. We, obviously, want to be at the top of that range. And everything goes right. Of course, you can always be outside of it. But, as we all know, you always get thrown curve balls, too. So -- and we still have a little bit of dilution to our direct plans. That's pretty minor these days, but it's still there. So solid execution of all of these things we talked about, including the incremental caps spend and that would be icing on the cake. It would be certainly positive for our growth rate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just to -- I'm sorry, if I'm a little slow on this. But I'm not completely clear as to what -- I mean, you guys have been trying to reduce regulatory lag for some time. And what is it that makes you guys feel more confident about it? Is it because of the legislative efforts you might be making? Is it because you're getting better response in terms of people seeing things your way on the regulatory side? What is it, just if you could break it down? Or just, simply, what do you think it is that's going to be making this more successful in terms of the efforts you've already made?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Sure. Well, let's look at why we've had regulatory lag. I think that's probably a good place to start, and we've had a lot of capital spend as you know. And most of that spend has not been recovered through a multi-year compact. So that puts natural pressure on you. There has been a recession, sales have been flat, that's put pressure on you. We've had higher pension expenses as we worked off those market losses. And from an accounting perspective, that puts pressure on you. And so all of that has created lag. And then you look forward and you realize we have a multi-year compact in Colorado, we're hoping to renew that, we want to enter into a similar type of arrangement in Minnesota. You combine that with the fact that post '15, while we still have a good pipeline of opportunities, the acceleration smooths out, so the capital spend and associated recovery smooths out a bit. Our own internal efforts to manage cost and still achieve the reliability and safety goals we have through standardization, they are starting to take hold. So you combine what's happened in the past and then you look towards the future, when it looks like sales are rebounding as well. So you put all those factors together, and I think that puts us in pretty good shape. Perhaps not right away but within fairly short order to start closing that gap.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Great. That's very helpful. And then just to clarify a few things. The upstream rate based opportunities, when you think you might be able to tell us more about it? I know you guys are in preliminary discussions. When do you think we might learn more about how those discussions are going?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I really -- I'd love to give you a timeframe, but I would -- I don't have that because it's -- again, we are in early days. So as the opportunities arise and as the math pans out then we'll talk about it.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And just to clarify, are you guys -- you guys are not interested in upstream non-rate based opportunities, is that right? Or, I mean -- or are you, perhaps have a...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, it could be -- I'm sorry to cut you. It could be a FERC rate base. But we're not interested in merchant type.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: You're not interested in being an EP company?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Right.
Teresa S. Madden: No.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. I just want to make sure. And then the RFPs in the FERC Order 1000. Again, when might be we hear more about what you guys might be involved in there? Any sense as to -- like just sort of a rough timeframe as to when we might hear more about that?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, the RFPs and STP are, I mean, they are going to issue them early next year. So we are anticipating a 90-day bid process. And then those who choose to participate they will be evaluated by the STP at that time. So mid to later next year.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. As you know the Integrated Transmission Plan 10 came out. It was about -- I think it was 40-odd projects about, roughly estimated $450 million. The next step will be the near-term plans that come out. And then what we anticipate, as Teresa mentioned, probably later in '15 is another Integrated Transmission plan 10-year look, which would incorporate some of the considerations under the 111(d) rules. I think that's what the timeframe is.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.
Ashar Khan: I just wanted to get a little bit sense -- when at mid-point, if I'm right -- when we started off this year it was, like, 197, 198 and the mid-point, if I am right, is around 2.7, 2.8, which is, like, $0.10 increase, if I'm doing my math correct, around 5% increase in EPS. But then when I look up your last slide where you gave us the rate base, which was at the Wolfe conference, the rate base for '15 was estimated at 22.4. For '14, was at 20.7. So that was like nearly an 8%, 8.2% increase in rate base. It was the strongest rate base growth in the horizon of the 5-year forecast. So what I'm trying to equate is, what is happening that we're losing -- if rate base numbers are still correct and they haven't changed, why is the 8.2% increase in rate base, '15 versus '14, getting diluted to 5% increase in EPS during the 2 years?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, Ashar, I would say our rate base growth-- I mean, it is moderating because we're coming through some major spend. I mean, our nuclear spend is essentially completed. So we're expecting it to moderate back, so you're seeing some of that -- of the past rate base growth. But as we look forward, we talked about what we would anticipate going forward, which would align with our earnings growth that we're talking about.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I would say we'd probably -- it would have to go through a lot of the timing expectations and everything else, but...
Teresa S. Madden: Exactly.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Probably be better to do that offline.
Unknown Executive: Well, and, plus, Ashar, it does reflect the timing of rate cases and what we request in rate cases. Clearly, in Minnesota, we've got a step increase for 2015, but doesn't cover all the capital that's being spent. So things like that are what drive that, we think we've issued 2015 guidance that is realistic for us and that's what we've put out there.
Ashar Khan: Okay. I'll try come offline and try discuss it. Because I just thought it was -- when you have a higher rate base growth and you have equity needs, you have kind of toned down since the last time I just don't understand why the growth rate is not higher in '15 versus '14, in commensurate to the rate base?
Unknown Executive: We will talk about it offline.
Operator: We will take our question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors
Andrew Levi: I guess, most questions have been asked. I guess, I mean, if you get to the top end of the your range, though, then just back on an assurance question, and then you're kind of close to that kind of that growth rate 2015. But anyway -- just on the 4% to 6%. It just seems, I guess, with all the things that have occurred, whether it's lack of issuing shares and all the other things that you've outlined over the last several months, including today, would it be fair to say that you're a lot more confident about being able to achieve the top end of your range over the next few years?
Teresa S. Madden: I mean, Andy, we have a range and we are within the range, and we're confident we'll achieve within the range.
Andrew Levi: But no difference of being able to be more confident on the top end?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, we are going to do everything to be on the top end, but, I mean, I think, Teresa said it, and I mean, we're keeping with the 4% to 6% growth from both the dividend and EPS.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I just had -- want to make sure I understand your -- the impact of the lag reduction. If you start with the ballpark 10% ROE and you reduce lag by 50 basis points, that's 5% improvement. So is that 75 to base -- 75 to 80 basis points just that compounding over 5 years to get to 5%. Is that the right way to look at it?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, maybe. I mean, if we start, I wouldn't start with that 10%. I would start with -- the regulated utilities are earning more around 9% at that level. So I think that would change your math, just your starting point, which would follow -- would fall out from that.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So the 75 to 80 is potentially incremental to the 4% to 6%? Or gets you firmly within the 4% to 6% and then, by year 5, you've probably maxed out the opportunity?
Teresa S. Madden: We would be close, assuming whatever our authorized are -- we are holding our authorized at the same level right now.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to inquire what your major states are doing or what you're doing with the regulators and legislators there on the response to 111(d)? Are you working closely with them to propose responses? Can you give us any sense of -- obviously, it's early in the process but any sense of where things might be headed and, in particular, the possible impact on your operations?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, we're definitely working close with our -- all of our stakeholders in all of our key states and our goal -- and our senators and our governors are very much on board with this is that-- as was mentioned in the preamble 111(d) Xcel Energy's model utility on how things get done, achieving environmental objectives and keeping costs affordable for consumers, but we are disappointed that we're not getting the credit we believe we deserve for the early action that we have taken. So [indiscernible] But we are disciplined that we're not getting the credit we believe we deserve for the early action that we've taken. So there is lobbying on their end, we are lobbying through the industry groups, we are doing out reach ourselves with the EPA, and we are going to work as hard as we can to get the final rules shaped in a way that I think is more equitable to those companies and those states that have been out front and moving towards where the EPA wants to take us. So very much engaged all the way down the line.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: And do you have any clarity at this point on the potential for shutting down some of the coal plants, et cetera, in addition to the ones that are, obviously, previous EPA rules have impacted?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. I mean, I think you really got to wait for the final rules. As you know, the EPA came out with, what is it, a notice of data availability yesterday or the day before. That suggest -- that maybe there's some of the interim targets the 2020 targets maybe there's a glide path there, maybe there's some flexibility on the base [indiscernible]. But not much more clarity than that.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just one clarification, Ben or Teresa. The 4% to 6% EPS growth, let's say, over the next 5 years, does that continue to assume a 1% growth in weather normalized electric sales? Or do you have a different growth number going forward?
Teresa S. Madden: No. That's basically what we're assuming. That's correct, Ali.
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden: Well, thank you, all, for participating in our earnings call this morning, and please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team, with any follow-up questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thank you.
Teresa S. Madden: Thank you.
Operator: And this will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Paul Johnson – VP, IR Benjamin Fowke – Chairman, President and CEO Teresa Madden – SVP and CFO
Analysts:  Michael Weinstein – UBS Travis Miller – Morningstar Inc. Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder this call is being recorded today, July 31, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy’s 2014 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning we will review our 2014 second quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 guidance. Slides that accompany today’s conference call are available on our web page. In addition we will post a video on our website of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results. As a reminder some of the comments during today’s conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC. I’ll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you, Paul and good morning. Let me start by highlighting some of the key takeaways from the quarter and Teresa will provide more detail on some of these items. Overall we had another solid quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share, compared with $0.40 per share last year. It’s important to recognize that last year’s results included a positive weather benefit of $0.03 per share while this year’s weather was relatively normal for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we are $0.03 per share ahead of last year and expect to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. Our guidance range is based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings. Our quarterly results benefited from better than expected sales growth for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis weather just had electric sales increased 1.7% and weather adjusted for natural gas sales increased 5%. While we are hesitant to call this trend it is certainly positive as it is the third quarter in a row in which weather adjusted sales have exceeded expectations. In the second quarter we completed our aftermarket equity program and we have now issued about $175 million of equity in 2014. I am very pleased to report that we no longer anticipate issuing any additional equity over the next five years beyond the normal issuances associated with our dividend reinvestment programs and benefit plans. This change in assumption is driven by our strong balance sheet and better than projected cash flows. There are no material changes to our capital expenditure assumption over the five year period. As you know in December we announced our plans to form a Transco. Our objective is to optimize our transmission investment as the FERC rules and market opportunities continue to involve. So this brings in preparation to participate in the MISO and SPP transmission competitive bidding processes we created two transmission subsidiaries. We formed the Xcel Energy Transmission Development Company which will compete for the first set of transmission projects expected to be proposed in MISO South. We also created the Xcel Energy Southwest transmission company which will compete for transmission projects in SPP. We expect SPP to release the first set of competitive transmission projects for bid in 2015. We are planning to make Federal and State Regulatory filings related to the Transcos in the third quarter of 2014 and we hope to have these regulatory proceedings resolved in 2015. Strategically the formation of Transcos will complement our existing transmission business which is expected to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years. While there may be some opportunities to transfer existing assets into our Transcos you should expect that the most of the plan in transmission spend over the next five years will be made at the operating company level. We will continue to take advantage of the right of first refusal and incumbency status we have in many of our states while at the same time, expanding our incremental transmission investment opportunities through our Transco operations. Bottom-line we have a great track record as a proven industry leader in transmission in terms of operation, development and construction and we are positioned to continue to have success as the market evolves. Finally I like to wrap-up my comments by discussing environmental policy. The EPA recently issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Rule which regulates – rather require states to develop plants to reduce Greenhouse emission from existing power plants by 30% by 2030. However the EPA has specific state reduction targets very significantly with certain state targets being very aggressive. For example, some of our states would be required to make reductions much greater than 30%. While incremental investment opportunities could arise from the more stringent EPA regulations we are concerned that the rule does not give sufficient credit to actions taken prior to 2012. Over the last decade we have implemented significant clean energy programs that have reduced our emissions. Our proactive actions to add renewables, retiring inefficient coal plants add new natural gas generation and add DFM that allowed us to successfully reduce our carbon emissions nearly 20% since 2015. Further we are on track to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2020. So what we need to do is make sure our customers receive full value for these initiatives and investments. The EPA will take public comment on the proposed rule and final rule is expected to be issued in 2015. We plan to continue to work constructively with the EPA and state policy makers and shape and implement the best final rule and state plans for our customer and the company. With that I will turn it over to Teresa.
Teresa Madden: Thanks Ben and good morning. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with earnings of $0.39 per share compared with 2013 second quarter earnings of $0.40 per share. The biggest driver of the difference was weather. 2013 second quarter results included a positive weather impact of just over $0.03 per share compared with relatively normal weather in 2014. Other drivers included improved electric and gas margins resulting from rate filing in several jurisdictions and better than expected weather adjusted sales. We also experienced higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expenses. These cost increases were expected and are consistent with our financial plan. Let me start by providing an update on sales in the economies in our service territories. Once again sales growth was stronger than expected for the quarter. Normally, we discuss quarterly results. However I am going to focus on year-to-date sales as the longer time frame is more indicative of a potential trend. Our year-to-date weather adjusted retail electric sales increased 1.7% and firm natural gas sales increased 5%. While growth was favorable across the board it varied by operating company. Beginning with SPS, year-to-date weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 3.6% largely driven by growth in the C&I class although we also saw strong residential growth. We continue to experience a positive impact from oil and gas exploration and production expansion in the Southeastern New Mexico Permian Basin area. Additional low growth in ethanol production and uranium enrichment also contributed to the higher sale. Year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at NSC Wisconsin increased 3.2%. Our C&I sales were strong primarily due to increased load from one of our larger customers who was operating their pipeline at reduced capacity in the first two quarters of 2013 but returned to full capacity in 2014. Customer growth combined with slightly increasing use per customer drove residential sales. Year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at PSCo increased 1.2% and were primarily attributable to customer growth in the residential sector and higher average use in the small C&I class. In addition, two new food manufacturing companies and improvement in the energy sector have fueled gain in the large C&I class. Finally year-to-date weather adjusted retail sales at NSP-Minnesota increased eight-tenths of a percent. The higher sales were driven by growth in number of customers increased use for customer in both the residential and the small C&I classes and the absence of storms that cause customer outages in 2013. Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 4.8% remains well below the national average of 6.3%. In addition, the number of the jobs in the Xcel Energy region grew 2.3% for the quarter, compared with 1.8% for the nation. While we are encouraged by the better than expected sales it is still too early to declare this a trend. We continue to project weather adjusted sales growth of about 1% for 2014 which is below the 1.7% growth we have experienced year-to-date. Turning more specifically to the second quarter earnings electric margin increased $48 million for the quarter. Key drivers included implementation of final and interim rate which increased margin by $38 million non-fuel riders increased margin by $17 million and stronger than anticipated weather adjusted sales increased margin by $7 million. These positive factors were partially offset by an unfavorable quarterly weather comparison, the recognition of the reserve for a potential customer refunded PSCo as well as other items. The reserve for a customer refund highlights the success of the 2012 three year rate plan we implemented in Colorado. Over the last three years we have earned or are projected to earn above our authorized return in our PSCo electric business. Clearly this demonstrates the advantages of a multi-year plan and supports our strategy of implementing multi-year rate plan in other jurisdictions. Turning to the natural gas side of the business, margin increased by $6 million. This was largely due to rate increases and weather adjusted sales growth partially offset by unfavorable weather impacts. O&M expenses increased $23 million, or 4.1% primarily driven by higher nuclear cost. As we discussed last quarter this deviation does not represents our planned run rate for the year. The year-to-date deviation is fueled due to the timing of O&M expenses in 2013. This was primarily due to the extended outage at our Monticello nuclear plant as part of the light extension and power upgrade project which was completed with the plant coming back online in the summer of 2013. As a reminder nuclear added cost are deferred during the outage and then amortized over the following 18 to 24 months. In addition, our O&M cost were at their highest level in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. Following the positive 2013 summer weather earnings impact we decided to increase our investment in the system in the later part of the year which serves to increase O&M in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. As a result, we continue to expect our 2014 O&M expenses will increase 2% to 3% consistent with our original guidance assumption. Finally, other taxes increased about $14 million or almost 14% largely driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. Next, I’ll comment on several regulatory proceedings, additional details are included in our earnings release. We recently filed rebuttal testimony in our Minnesota electric case and lowered our request by approximately $23 million in 2014 and $3.5 million in 2015. The revise request includes our updated sales forecast which reflects better than expected sales we have experienced in Minnesota. We also included a proposal to thru up sales based on weather adjusted results at the end of the year. In addition we also updated our property tax forecast and included a proposal to thru up to actual results at year end. We think these proposals address two of the more significant adjustments recommend by Department of Commerce. Key dates include; their rebuttal testimony is due August 4th, the ALJ report is scheduled for December and a final decision in this case is expected in March of 2015. In early July, the Department of Commerce filed their testimony in the modest Minnesota province review and recommended additional allowance of approximately $72 million on a Minnesota jurisdictional basis. This equates to a total amount of $91 million for NSP Minnesota. We disagree with the Department’s assessment and continue to believe our investment was prudent. While completing the projects too longer and cost more than we initially projected similar projects at other new nuclear plants across the country demonstrate that our experience was not unique. The project was in many way is more complicated and difficult than new construction. Regardless it was essential that this work be done right and we believe we made reasonable and prudent decisions over the five spent at the project. We had largely rebuild nuclear power plant that will provide our customers with carbon free low cost power for the next 20 year. We look forward to the opportunity to provide additional support for the project and to address issues raised by the Department of Commerce and any other interveners in our rebuttal testimony on August 26. Other key dates in the schedule include the Rebuttal testimony is due September 19, the ALJ report is scheduled for December and a final decision on the Monticello prudence review is expected in March of 2015. The results from the final decision will be implemented in the Minnesota] rate case decision. We remain confident that we will reach a constructive outcome in both the Minnesota rate case and the Monticello prudence review. In June, we filled a Colorado electric rate case seeing an increase in annual revenue of approximately $138 million, or 4.9% and the initiation of a clean air, clean job investment rider that would cover 2016 and 2017. Our objective is to establish on multi-year regulatory plan that provides certainty for PSCo and its customer. We believe this plan would accomplish that goal. It is early in the process so a procedure schedule hasn’t been established. However, we anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the first quarter of 2015. In Texas we requested a net increase in electric rates of $48.1 million or 5.3%. We are in settlement discussion with various parties and hope to reach an agreement soon. During the quarter we also filed rate cases in Wisconsin and South Dakota. Similar to Colorado it is still fairly early in the processes so, there isn’t much to report. Details on both these cases are included in the earnings release. It has been a busy regulatory schedule for us but these rate cases should be resolved by year-end or in the first quarter of next year and will provide us with regulatory certainty in 2015 and beyond. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. The guidance range based on several key assumptions as described in our earnings release including constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceeding. With that I will wrap-up my comments; with six months completed we are $0.03 per share ahead of last year and on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the 10th consecutive year. We continue to experience better than expected sales growth with year-to-date weather adjusted retail electric sales growth of 1.7% and weather adjusted firm natural gas sales growth of 5%. We have completed our aftermarket equity program and we don’t anticipate issuing any incremental equity beyond our dividend reinvestment and to fund benefit program over the next five years. This is based on our current capital expenditure plan. We continue to make program on the regulatory front and expect to reach constructive outcome in our major jurisdictions. We continue to expect 2014 O&M expenses to grow 2% to 3% from last year consistent with our original guidance assumption. And finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2014 earnings guidance and long-term financial objective of growing earnings and our dividend 4% to 6% annually. Operator we’ll now take questions.
Operator: Thank you very much (Operator Instructions). And our first question does come from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Michael Weinstein – UBS: Hi, I was wondering if you could expand more that the independent Transco plant. Which regions do you think you know the most opportunities and also like what kind of competitive advantage you might have outside of your own footprint?
Benjamin Fowke: The regions, this is, thanks for the question, this is Ben. The regions we would compete in would MISO and SPP. I think both regions offer great opportunities for us. We have got a history of delivering large projects and what comes to my mind when I say that is CapEx 2020, when you think about that, that’s a project where we have multiple partners. We collaborated with those partners and put together what turned out be an extremely transmission build in the upper Midwest. So we have got that advantage I think of being able to collaborate, we have a track record of delivering transmission projects at a price point that is – I haven’t seen anybody else match. And we are executing on time. So we have got a lot of experience. In fact I believe we are the largest builder of 345 lines in the nation. So I think you put all that together and we are positioned well to win in a competitive environment. Did I get your question answered right?
Michael Weinstein – UBS: Yes, yes, thanks. And one of the questions and this is more related to the Colorado rate case. Just curious about given economic conditions and your view of the future I realize that you are in discussions right now – I don’t know what you can say, what what’s more important? A multi-year settlement that keeps things steady for many years or trackers?
Benjamin Fowke: There is amount – difference spokes all go to the center of the wheel, the important thing is the result. You probably could with either, to be quite honest with you.
Michael Weinstein – UBS: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question does from line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Inc.: Good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Travis.
Teresa Madden: Good morning.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Inc.: Hi, thanks. I am going to stay on the Transco subject here, I was wondering what your thoughts are in terms of long-term investment projects and potential growth, even the viability of a Transco if FERC comes back with the rate cuts perhaps they have targeted or suggest in the Northeast and then obviously the complaints in MISO. What are your thoughts on if we get a 100 basis points -150 basis points cuts in FERC ROEs in terms of the viability and growth opportunities in Transco.
Benjamin Fowke: Well I think Travis clearly the lower the allowed ROE is the more of a damper it puts on the enthusiasm to build transmission. That said it doesn’t surprise us that we are starting to see those ROEs do down and I think in a competitive environment they might go down for other reasons. But the advantage I think of having a Transco is it allows you to look at larger footprint that allows you to more efficiently collaborate with other partners and it gives you much more financial flexibility. So I think you are going to see that trend perhaps continue hopefully not as severe as you mentioned but don’t I think that dampens desire you want have a Transco.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Inc.: Okay, that is great. And then on that competition side that you mentioned, how much competition do you expect here, I’ve heard a couple of companies mentioned this and especially in that MISO SPP region. Are you thinking this is three person, a horse race is three horse race or this five or seven?
Benjamin Fowke: I think it’s going to be 0- everybody has a Transco and everybody wants to build transmission so, I think it will be very competitive much – many more parties than three.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Inc.: Okay, great. I appreciate the thoughts.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question does come from line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys congrats on a good quarter. A couple of questions, first of all, you commented about the potential for moving some of the existing assets into a Transco. Just curious if you can put some number around that in terms or size or scale existing rate base that you move out of the state jurisdiction and in to a FERC jurisdiction or subsidiary?
Benjamin Fowke: Well Michael we are really in early days thinking about those kinds of opportunities and let’s make it clear that they would require state regulatory approval and as we know that can be difficult to achieve, it’s not impossible particularly you if can demonstrate customer value to regulators, which I think in some circumstances we can. I can’t really give you a number. I would – the guidance that we have said on the call and I would continue to stick with that, as you should think the $4.5 billion that we are going to spend, most of it would be at the operating company level. I think we have some incremental opportunities to the Transco that would probably be in the later part of our five year forecast and that would be on top of the $4.5 billion and then of course in the five years that follows I think Transco would play a more predominant role.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Changing topics a little bit and thinking longer-term, not necessarily next two to three years, but maybe next five to ten, when you look across your system and across your states which of your jurisdictions will have the greatest need for potential new or incremental renewable asests in order to meet the statement the state renewable standards and which one have less of a need?
Benjamin Fowke: Well we are actually in very good shape to meet the state renewable standards. We are ahead of the game, significantly ahead of the game but maybe what you are referring to is what the EPA rules, where we have to do more. I mean is that what you are kind of driving at?
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: No, I’m really kind of thinking about, it’s funny everybody really thinks about the numerator when they are thinking about renewable megawatt hour. They forget that a lot these are set on a percent of sales. So if you are seeing sales recovery a little bit greater than what is the in forecast the dominator changes and then it may impact what’s actually needed going forward. Just I’m kind of thinking about the bigger picture and really trying to think five and ten years down that road of where you could see or where the state you are in could see a need for incremental renewable RFPs?
Benjamin Fowke: Well I think we are in the – let me just give you my take on it, clearly the states could increase the renewable standards but where we stand today even with sales picking, I don’t see that moving the needle very much. I think that continues to put us in the position where we can add renewable without the pressure to do it now. So that means we can be more choosy and we can bring them on a better price points for our customers and that’s what we have been doing over the last decade and it’s really worked well for us. We’d like to see it continue but I don’t think we are going to be forced into it because of the state renewable standard.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: And finally once more in the industry question but also specifically for your assets. How do you think about the long-term growth rate in O&M for nuclear power plants relative to kind of your total long-term O&M growth rate targets for the consolidated entity?
Benjamin Fowke: That’s a really good question. I mean I obviously it’s been pretty significant over the last five years. We like to think it’s going to flatten now. I think a lot of that will depend you know additional regulations that might come out. If I were to – we were are going to give you a rough estimate I would say that it’s the nuclear O&M is going to hard pressed to be as flat as we anticipate the rest of our business. The degree of which I couldn’t really give you any particular insight at this point.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and any update on kind of your long-term O&M targets?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, I mean we are going to continue to push the O&M down. You know what our targets for the next five years and I think ultimately you have to have O&M growth match your sales growth and we continue to think that’s going to be despite the pick-up you know relatively flat and that’s where we want to see our O&M growth go. I back to nuclear side too I mean I think it’s important to recognize that in a carbon constrained world these nuclear plants are extremely valuable and so, if they require a bit more O&M in the rest of our business I still think they are very good value propositions for our customers.
Michael Lapides – Goldman Sachs: Got it, thank you much appreciated. Appreciate you taking my call.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question does come from line of [David Hess] with Wolfe Research.
Teresa Madden: Hi, David.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. How are you?
Benjamin Fowke: Good.
Unidentified Analyst: Now that you do not need the $700 million of external equity over the five year, how does the mix in your financing plan change? That is like what the rough percentage were from CSO from new debt and from DRIP?
Teresa Madden: Well we anticipate I mean in terms of we have previously said you know from the DRIP and the benefit plan that was $350 million. It’s a slight increase to 370 and the remainder would be to spend it through holding company debt. So you can just do that translation. I would say though that the remaining piece that we were talking about you said $700 million and we frankly completed a $175 million of that in the first-part of this year. We just finished up our ATM program so, it’s more in the $500 million range.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood, okay.
Benjamin Fowke: And David about a $130 million of incremental cash from operations too, to offset that.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, okay. And I think you said in your prepared remarks that your current five year capital plan is unchanged or at least not materially changed. Is that correct? If so, when do you expect to update your capital plan?
Teresa Madden: Yes, that’s I mean that’s correct we are basically the five year around $14 billion. It will be later this year. Generally we do it in our third quarter call but we will continue to monitor that but that would be the earliest that we would expect.
Unidentified Analyst: And given the discussion early on Transco, is it fair to say that when you grow forward one year that you probably can maintain that $14 billion or at least around that?
Teresa Madden: Yeah, I mean it’s going to be in that area code.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you so much.
Teresa Madden: Thank you.

Analysts: Michael Weinstein Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Glen F. Pruitt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Lauren B. Duke - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul A. Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2014 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. This morning, we'll review our 2014 first quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. In addition, we'll post a brief video of Teresa summarizing our financial results on our web page. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Overall, it was another strong quarter for Xcel Energy. I'm pleased to report that ongoing earnings for the first quarter of 2014 were $0.52 per share, compared with $0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2013. Our solid financial results were driven by rate increases, favorable weather and higher than expected weather adjusted sales growth. This positions us well as we head into the important summer months. Let me elaborate a bit more. The harsh winter we experienced in the upper Midwest increased earnings by almost $0.05 compared to a normal winter. Additionally, as you also know, extreme cold or heat, while improving the financial outlook, can also bring its share of operational challenges and this winter was certainly no exception. In fact, on Saturday, January 25, a rupture occurred on one of our supplier's natural gas pipelines in Canada, when temperatures were more than 20 degrees below 0 in our northern service territories. This rupture also caused 2 other pipelines to be removed from service for safety reasons, which significantly restricted the flow of natural gas into the region. Our employees worked around the clock with our suppliers and our customers to ensure that we avoided a potentially devastating natural gas outage. The results of those proactive steps, along with the tremendous willingness of our customers to conserve, prevented what could have been a very dangerous situation. Instead, by Monday, we had resumed service back to normal. For me, it speaks volumes about our ability to respond to an operational challenge. It also reminds all of us at Xcel Energy of the need to continue to invest, plan and strive for operational excellence to provide our customers the safe and reliable energy they expect. And besides weather, we're also seeing some potential upside for the year based on improving sales growth. And while it may a bit too early to call a trend, especially in light of the volatile weather we experienced, I am encouraged by the pickup we're beginning to see in sales, particularly in our commercial and industrial class. And Teresa will provide you more detail on this in a few minutes. This quarter, in addition to delivering strong financial performance, we continued to pursue our environmental goals which we believe are important to our long-term success. I'm proud to announce that AWEA has named us the #1 wind provider in America for the 10th consecutive year. Providing our customers with renewable energy at the right cost and in the most efficient manner continues to be a high priority. We support solar generation and believe there is a right way to do solar to maximize the benefit for all customers. As a result, we've undertaken several initiatives. In Colorado, we recently proposed a new program called Solar*Connect, which will provide our customers energy options from large-scale solar projects. The program will complement rooftop solar offerings and solar gardens, and give customers alternatives for buying solar power. Our goal is to make solar energy accessible to all customers even if they don't have the ability to put photovoltaic panels on their home or business. In Minnesota, we recently issued an RFP for up to 100 megawatts of large-scale solar generation to be installed by 2016. This RFP will help us meet the state solar mandate in a cost-effective manner. Both of these initiatives take advantage of the efficiencies of large-scale solar and provide our customers with additional renewable options. It demonstrates our commitment to have solar as a key component of our resource portfolio, and reflects our intention to see solar done the right way. And as always, we're very focused on continuing to deliver shareholder value. In February, we increased our dividend by 7% to ensure that we provide an attractive dividend yield. The increase also reflects our flexibility as a result of our strong balance sheet, a relatively low payout ratio and the confidence we have in our business plan. Our long-term objective is to grow the dividend 4% to 6% annually. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thank you, Ben, and good morning. As Ben indicated, we are pleased to report another solid quarter with earnings of $0.52 per share, compared with 2013 first quarter earnings of $0.48 per share. In summary, drivers of the favorable results included new and interim rates being implemented across several jurisdictions, positive weather and higher than expected weather adjusted sales. These positive factors were partially offset by higher O&M and property taxes. Let me start by providing an update on sales and the economies in our local service territories. Overall, sales growth was stronger than expected for the quarter. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 2%, and firm natural gas sales increased 3.7%. While growth was favorable across the board, it varied by operating company. We have added a table to our earnings release that breaks down sales by utility to provide you with more detail. Beginning with SPS, weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 4%, largely driven by growth in the C&I class, although we saw strong residential growth. The energy sector continues to provide a positive impact from oil and gas drilling activities in the Southeastern New Mexico Permian Basin area. Additional load growth in ethanol production and uranium enrichment also contributed to the higher sales. Weather-adjusted retail sales at NSP-Wisconsin increased 3.3%. C&I sales were strong, primarily due to increased load from one of our larger customers that was operating their pipeline at reduced capacity in the first quarter of 2013, but returned to full capacity in 2014. Residential customer growth, combined with slightly increasing use per customer, drove residential sales. Additionally, propane shortages in the region likely contributed to the strong growth. As a result, we don't think this represents a sustainable growth trend. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales at PSCo increased 1.4%, primarily driven by higher average use in the small C&I class, a new cheese factory, along with recovery at a steel mill and customer growth in the residential class. Finally, weather-adjusted retail electric sales at NSP-Minnesota, increased 1.2%, led by C&I sales growth of 1.5% and modest residential sales improvement. Economic conditions are generally stronger across the Xcel Energy region compared to the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in our service territory of 5.4% remains well below the national average of 6.8%. In addition, the number of jobs in the Xcel Energy region grew 2.2% for the quarter compared with 1.7% for the nation. As Ben mentioned, while we are encouraged to see better than expected sales, it is still too early to declare this a trend. Regardless, we have adjusted our annual sales guidance to reflect our year-to-date performance. As a result, we now anticipate electric sales growth of up to 1% for 2014. Turning more specifically to first quarter earnings. Electric margin increased $68 million for the quarter. Key drivers included final and interim rates which increased margin by $38 million, severe cold weather increased margin by $21 million. To put this in perspective, in Minnesota, it was the 9th coldest quarter on record, and the coldest quarter since 1979. In addition, stronger than anticipated weather-adjusted sales increased margin by $12 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by the recognition of a reserve for potential custom refund at PSCo as well as other items. The reserve for a customer refund highlights the success of the 2012 3-year rate plan we implemented in Colorado. Over the last 3 years, we have earned above our authorized return in our PSCo electric business. The multiyear plan included an earnings test which provides for the sharing of earnings above a 10% ROE between customers and the company. As a result, both the company and customers have benefited from the multiyear plan. Clearly, this demonstrates the advantage of a multiyear plan and supports our strategy of implementing this approach in other jurisdictions. Turning to the natural gas side of the business, margin increased by $25 million. This was largely due to rate increases, cold weather and additional revenue recovered through the pipeline integrity rider in Colorado. O&M expenses increased $31 million or 5.8%. Key drivers include nuclear costs as well as distribution and transmission expenses. It's important to point out that this deviation does not represent our planned run rate for the year. The quarterly deviation is skewed due to the timing of O&M expenses in 2013, which were at their lowest point in the first quarter. This was primarily due to the extended outage at our Monticello nuclear plant as part of the light extension and power upgrade project, which was completed and the plant came back online in the summer of 2013. As a reminder, our nuclear outage costs are deferred during the outage and then amortized over the following 18 to 24 months. In addition, our O&M costs were at their highest level in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. Following the positive summer weather earnings impact, we decided to increase our investment in the system in the latter part of the year, which served to increase O&M in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. As a result, we continue to expect that our 2014 O&M expenses will increase 2% to 3% consistent with our original guidance assumption. Finally, other taxes increased about $11 million or 10%, primarily driven by higher property taxes in Minnesota and Colorado. Next, I will provide some detail on the financial results of each of our operating companies. NSP-Minnesota earnings were flat for the quarter. Colder weather and interim electric rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota, effective in January 2014, were offset by higher O&M expenses, primarily nuclear driven, and lower AFUDC. It is also important to point out that the results for the first quarter of 2013 reflect interim rates in Minnesota which were recorded at a level higher than the final rates implemented later in 2013. PSCo's earnings were also flat for the quarter. Higher rates and sales growth were offset by increased property taxes, depreciation and accruals associated with the electric earnings test refund obligation. SPS's earnings increased $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to higher electric rates implemented mid-year 2013 and an interim rider designed to recover costs associated with transmission infrastructure in Texas, partially offset by O&M expenses. NSP-Wisconsin earn increased -- earnings increased $0.01 per share for the quarter due to colder weather and an electric rate increase effective in January 2014, partially offset by higher O&M expense. Next, I'll comment on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. I will begin with the recently concluded cases. As we've previously discussed, the primary objective of our regulatory strategy is to implement multiyear plans in our various jurisdictions. In North Dakota, the Commission recently approved a comprehensive 4-year settlement agreement which covers 2013 through 2016. The multiyear plan provides for annual rate increases of 4.9% for the first 3 years, and no rate increase in the final year. The plan also includes an increasing ROE from 9.75% to 10.25% during this multiyear period. In New Mexico, the Commission recently approved an overall rate increase of approximately $33 million, based on a forward test year, an ROE of 9.96% and our requested equity ratio of 53.9%. Both of these decisions represent constructive outcomes and a good start to the regulatory calendar. Now turning to our pending cases. In Minnesota, we filed a 2-year electric rate case that covers both 2014 and 2015. Interim rates went into effect in January. At this point, it is very -- fairly early and we are still in the discovery stage of the process. The procedural schedule has been established and key dates include: intervener testimony is due in June; the ALJ report is scheduled for December; and a final decision in this case is expected in March of 2015. The Monticello prudence review is following a similar timeline for the Minnesota rate case. We are also in the discovery phase of this proceeding. Key dates for the procedural schedule include: intervener testimony is due in July; the ALJ report is scheduled for December; and a final decision on the Monticello prudence review is expected in March of 2015. The results from the final decision will be implemented as part of the Minnesota rate case decision. In Texas, we have requested a net increase in electric rates of $48.1 million or 5.3%. Intervener testimony is due in May and hearings are planned for June. We anticipate a final decision, with implementation of new rates in the third quarter. However, I should point out that we have been in settlement discussions with various parties and are hopeful that we can come to an agreement in the near term. We are also preparing several filings for our other jurisdictions. In Colorado, our multiyear electric plan ends in 2014. We anticipate that the 2015 through '17 rate deficiency will be modest, with the key drivers being increased property taxes and capital costs associated with the Clean Air-Clean Jobs project. Our goal is to, again, implement a regulatory plan covering multiple years. We have been meeting with key stakeholders to discuss various options for moving forward. In addition to a multiyear plan, we are also considering other approaches, including the implementation of riders to recover property tax and costs associated with the Clean Air-Clean Jobs project. As we get input from our customers and other parties, we will determine the specific path that we will pursue. We also plan to file a limited reopener in Wisconsin as well as an electric rate case in South Dakota in late spring or early summer. These rate cases should be resolved by year end and will provide us with regulatory certainty in 2015. So, turning to our financing plans, in March, PSCo issued $300 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at a very attractive coupon of 4.3%. We plan to issue the following first mortgage bonds during the first half of the year. Approximately $300 million at NSP-Minnesota; approximately $150 million at SPS; and approximately $100 million at NSP-Wisconsin. In the first quarter we also issued approximately $78 million of equity, or 2.6 million shares, at an average price of $30.22 per share through our aftermarket, or dribble, program. This has proven to be a cost-effective method for us to issue equity. Additionally, we continue to review our future financing plans and believe we may have the flexibility to reduce our previously forecasted equity needs over the next 5 years based on strong -- our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Further, we are analyzing the potential impact of the possible extension of bonus depreciation. We will continue to evaluate our financing plans and expect to provide an update later this year. Finally, I want to mention that during the quarter Moody's upgraded the credit ratings of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries one notch. The outlook is stable. This morning we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. Please note, we've updated certain guidance assumptions. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release. While we've had some positive weather and sales have been stronger than expected, we believe it is too early in the year to provide a more comprehensive update related to our 2014 earnings guidance expectations. With that, I'll wrap up my comments. Clearly, we had another strong quarter, which is a great start to the year. We continue to make progress on the regulatory front with the constructive completion of rate cases in North Dakota and New Mexico. We are well-positioned to deliver on our 2014 earnings guidance and long-term financial objective of growing earnings and our dividends 4% to 6% annually. Finally, we are looking forward to hosting our annual meeting in Fargo, North Dakota on May 21. North Dakota is a state of growth and opportunity and we are proud to serve this fine community. So with that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Michael Weinstein: Could you talk a little bit more about Black Dog and the process for getting a PPA there? What's going wrong with it? I think what we heard on the Calpine call was that they are now saying that this process might go into late 2014, maybe early '15.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: First, let me just clarify. Black Dog is our self-build option, and Calpine, of course would be the PPA, power purchase agreement option that we referred to. And what the Commission instructed us to do is basically negotiate with all parties' top line and energy and continue to look at our own options and present them the alternatives. Timeframe is later in the year.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, we're required to respond by October. So then, it would be deliberated on after that. So that timeline is probably fairly consistent.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: A question unrelated to the quarter, but just given what's happened at the Supreme Court with CASPR, kind of how should we book-end the potential impact on your capital plans?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: That's a great question, Paul. We were pretty concerned about that ruling, particularly in Texas. But a lot's happened since 2011. We've -- within SPS, we've added 700 megawatts of renewables. We've put on a more efficient gas plant in Jonesboro, we've put some abatement equipment on. And then given MATS and low gas prices across the nation, we've seen more retirements of coal plants. So the allowance market has increased significantly. So the bottom line is we don't see it as very significant to our capital plans. As a matter of fact, I mean, more to come on this. And I think it's going to be interesting to see what EPA ultimately does with this decision. But the bottom line is we think any gaps that we may have in compliance right now, we can probably meet with the purchase of allowances, which would be pretty minimal and with flow-through fuel recovery mechanisms that we have.
Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just any update on Boulder?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Not too much. There's been some administrative things. In April the city went -- did the first vote on forming a power and light utility. It's, I think it's part of the process they need to go through to be able to issue bonds. It's kind of part of the formal process. So we also continue to work with officials to try to craft some kind of solution that might work for both parties to avoid the municipalization, but right now that's the path we're on, and it's a long path. As we've talked about before, it's going to take more than 3 years probably to see all this through.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Glen Pruitt with Wells Fargo.
Glen F. Pruitt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: My question has to do with the solar programs you mentioned in your planned remarks. Over the last several years, a lot of companies have offered solar and renewable options to customers. Primarily, they were focused on just offering some percentage of your bill from solar or other renewables. I was wondering if you could give me some idea how your programs are different from those programs? Because they haven't been well received by customers in a lot of places.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I can't speak to other places, but our Windsource program has been extremely popular. And so we're trying to augment that particular program, starting in Colorado with the Solar*Connect program. It gives people that perhaps don't want to put panels on their roof or can't afford to or aren't in the right position because of their angle to the sun to have another option to have more renewable energy in their energy mix. So I think the -- I think our programs in the past have been well received. I think this program, the initial response is, well, it's generally favorable.
Teresa S. Madden: Maybe I would just add to that. The Solar*Connect program we think will be also more cost-effective than adding just solar to rooftop. It would potentially be about half the cost, in terms of having centralized solar as the resource.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, that's our whole intention. That's how we've -- look, we are a leader in renewables. I mean, 10-year running as the #1 wind provider in a the United States. Supportive of solar across all of our territories. But we're also very diligent at bringing on renewables at the right price point for all customers, and we want to continue to do that. It's extremely important that we never lose sight of what we're trying to accomplish with renewables, which in my mind is reducing carbon in an efficient manner. And we want to do that as efficiently as possible, as transparently as possible and as fairly as possible to all customers.
Glen F. Pruitt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, and one follow-up question, not related. Considering some of the issues that are -- other utilities are having related to coal ash storage. Do you foresee any potential issues at your fossil plants and any possible future investment due to this new focus?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: No. Not really. Our disposals are quite a lot different than the issues you saw back on the East Coast. Clearly, we're going to watch and see if the EPA does turn around and classify coal ash as a hazard, that could drive up some expense. But the Ponnes themselves were in very good shape. As a matter of fact, EPA has given us very, very high marks for our Sherco plant, which would be the -- it's not close but it'd be the closest thing related to the some of the Ponne-ash disposal -- or Ponne-ash facilities on the East Coast.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Lauren Duke with Deutsche Bank.
Lauren B. Duke - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to ask about Colorado. You mentioned considering your options as your multiyear plan expires. And clearly, you guys are very happy with how the plan has turned out. What about the other parties to the settlement? I mean, do you get the sense that they are similarly pleased with how that worked out? Meaning, you think you could come forward with another multiyear settlement? And in the absence of a settlement, do you still feel comfortable that the Commission would be willing to approve one given what happened on the gas side?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think, by and large, the parties are happy with the multiyear plan. We -- you always have to go back and kind of review what you entered into and how it actually worked. We had some pleasant upside surprises, sales and tax things. Cost-containment that we initiated that really helped to make, I think, the multiyear plan work for all parties. I think the Commission is supportive of a multiyear plan. I also think, as Teresa mentioned, the drivers of what we need over the next several years, are really pretty specific. And it's recovery of the investments we're making under the Clean Air-Clean Jobs program. And it's recovery of property taxes. So I mean, the ask isn't going to be as big as I think parties maybe had perceived, and I think the pathway to settlement and the pathway to getting either a multiyear or a rider-type program in place, are, I think the prospects are pretty good.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Teresa Madden for closing comments.
Teresa S. Madden: Well, thanks, everyone. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paul A. Johnson: Good morning and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 Year-End Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our 2013 results and discuss our 2014 priorities, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2014 earnings guidance. Slides of the company today's conference call are available on our web page. In addition, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on our website. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release in our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2013 GAAP earnings of $1.91 per share included a $0.04 per share charge as a result of a 2013 FERC decision regarding fuel cost -- fuel and cost allocations at SPS. These issues relate to complaints by parties dating back to 2004 and 2006. While we are pursuing reconsideration of these orders, they resulted in a refund liability for prior periods. And consequently, we took a $36 million pretax charge during the third quarter of 2013. 2012 GAAP earnings of $1.85 per share included a $0.03 per share tax benefit associated with federal subsidies for prescription drugs planned that were previously expensed. Both items are excluded from ongoing earnings. Management believes ongoing earnings, provides a more meaningful comparison as representative of Xcel Energy's Fundamental core earnings power. As a result, our comments will focus on 2013 ongoing earnings of $1.95 per share compared with 2012 ongoing earnings of $1.82 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'm pleased to announce another successful year at Xcel Energy. In addition to delivering on our annual financial objectives, we executed on several initiatives that position Xcel Energy for continued financial and operational success in the years to come. Let me start by discussing some of our 2013 highlights. Once again, we delivered strong financial results. Ongoing earnings grew over 7% to $1.95 per share. This marks the ninth consecutive year with net books [ph] exceeded our earnings guidance. In the fourth consecutive year, we have delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We also raised our annual dividend $0.04 per share or nearly 4%. We completed rate cases in several jurisdictions, which helped us to achieve our financial objectives in 2013. Looking back on 2013, we're especially proud of the commitment to customers that our employees demonstrated again and again. A series of severe weather events, including blizzards, high storms, thunderstorms and floods, brought out the company's best efforts. We also completed several major construction projects, including the effort to extend the life of our Monticello nuclear plant, and we placed steam generators at our Prairie Island nuclear plant. Our Sherco 3 coal fire unit is back in service after sustaining major damage in 2011. We brought Jones 4 online in Texas and in time for higher summer load and to help serve the continued industrial growth we're seeing in the region. Colorado. We made great progress on the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act projects, including the Cherokee combined-cycle plant and adding SCRs and scrubbers to Ponne, as well as SCRs at Hayden. Overall, these projects remain on time and on budget. Another major focus in 2013 was our ongoing work to increase the strength and reliability of the electric grid. We're making significant investments to ensure the system is ready to accommodate renewable energy, interact with new technologies and withstand major weather events. Strong energy grid ensures that we're able to meet the growing and changing energy needs of our customers. We are set to increase our future wind production by 40%. And given the current price of wind energy, this is an excellent way to protect our customers from rising fuel costs. The American Wind Energy Association recognized our efforts to promote wind production when they named us The Utility of the Year. And we obviously the appreciate the designation, but we're particularly satisfied that we've determined how to make wind energy an affordable option for customers. In another effort that leverages our environmental leadership for customer gain, we were able to announce in 2013 that we're on track to exceed our goal of reducing carbon emissions from our power plants, 20% by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. We are well positioned on this run in part because we acted early in converting and refurbishing power plants and because we have such a solid portfolio of renewable energy sources. With a successful 2013 behind us, we're ready to make 2014 another good year. Our focus will be on ensuring that Xcel Energy is the energy provider that our customers prefer and value. We have initiatives underway to achieve productivity improvements through technology and to leverage employee engagement. We will continue our efforts to strengthen the energy grid, build our portfolio of renewable energy resources and reduce emissions from our plants. Part of our effort to strengthen the grid, we plan to invest $4.5 billion on transmission projects over the next 5 years. We've proven that we can design, cite and construct transmission for less than our competitors. And we see significant opportunities right in our backyard. We believe forming a Transco will provide multiple benefits, including enabling increased flexibility to support our operations in the post-FERC Order 1000 transmission investment environment. Depending on regulatory treatment, we believe that our planned projects in the Southwest Power Pool fit nicely into a Transco. The necessary regulatory filings will be submitted later this year, and we hope to have approvals by late 2014 or early 2015. Another key priority for us is to deliver constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings and to improve the overall regulatory construct. In 2014, we hope to put in place multiyear-rate plans in Minnesota, Colorado, North Dakota and potentially other jurisdictions, which will provide revenue certainty for shareholders and cost certainty for our customers. Achievement of our 2014 priorities will allow us to deliver on our objectives and provide an attractive total return to our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. As you can see from our earnings release, we had another strong year. On a consolidated basis, 2013 ongoing earnings grew $0.13 per share or 7% to $1.95. This resulted in a consolidated ROE of 10.5% on an ongoing basis. The improvement in profitability was primarily the result of new interim rates implemented across several jurisdictions, positive weather and lower interest expense. These positive factors were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expenses. More specifically, I wanted to provide you with some insight into several drivers for the year. First, weather was very favorable in 2013, increasing earnings almost $0.11 per share compared to normal, and $0.06 per share compared to 2012. Sales growth was slightly stronger than expected for 2013. Weather-adjusted retail electric sales increased 0.4%, and firm natural gas sales increased 3.8%. However, sales growth varied by operating company. On a weather-adjusted basis, our electric sales growth by OPCO was: NSP-Wisconsin, 0.8%; PSCo, 1%; SPS, 1.7%; and NSP-Minnesota declined 0.8%. The economies in our service territories continue to improve. Overall, compared to the national average, we had higher job growth and lower unemployment in our service territory. Finally, at SPS, we sold 2 small segments of transmission lines that were no longer needed to support our customers. As a result, we recognized a $0.02 per share gain on the transaction after sharing with customer. Next, I will provide some detail on the financial results of each of our operating company. At NSP-Minnesota, ongoing earnings grew 13% to $0.79 per share, primarily due to new rates going into effect in Minnesota and South Dakota, and interim rate in North Dakota. Cooler winter weather and lower interest charges also served to improve 2013 earnings. Even with the benefit of positive weather at NSP-Minnesota, our earned 2013 ROE of 9.2% was well below our authorized level. We have filed a propose multiyear-rate plan in Minnesota in an effort to close this gap. Earnings at PSCo increased $0.01 per share in 2013. The primary drivers were higher electric and natural gas rates, cooler weather and lower interest charges. These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M and customer refunds related to the 2013 electric earnings test. Similar to 2012, in Colorado, we over-earned our authorized electric ROE of 10%. As a result, we recognized a refund obligation to customers. After accounting for this refund, as well as the under-earnings in our natural gas business, PSCo earned a consolidated ROE of approximately 9.7% in 2013. At SPS, earnings increased $0.01 per share to $0.23 for the year. The positive impact of an electric rate increase in Texas and the sale of transmission assets to Sharyland were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Our ongoing ROE was 9% at SPS. We continue to make progress on regulatory front, getting writers put in place and the use of a forward test gear in New Mexico. Texas and New Mexico offers substantial organic growth opportunities due to the continued expansion of the oil and gas industries located within our service territory. As a result, we've identified certain attractive infrastructure investments that will help develop this part of the country. Getting the rules in place to ensure timely recovery, as well as establishing an alternative investment structure that Ben discussed, will be an important part of our future. We've made great progress at SPS and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. Finally, earnings in NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.02 per share, as a result of higher electric and natural gas rates, cooler winter weather partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation. Our earned ROE at NSP-Wisconsin was 10.6%, slightly higher than our overall authorized level. I'll now comment on several of our pending regulatory proceedings. Additional details related to these and other proceedings are included in today's press release. As you may recall, last November, we filed a 2-year electric rate case in Minnesota. In December, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved our request to file and granted a $127 million or 4.6% interim rate increase, which went into effect earlier this month. The Commission also agreed that our request to accelerate the theoretical depreciation reserve amortization was permissible. The procedural schedule for the Minnesota case was established this week and is included in the earnings release. Intervenor testimony is due in June, hearings are scheduled for August, the ALJ report is due in December, and a final decision in this case is expected in the first quarter of 2015. In our North Dakota electric rate case, we reached a comprehensive multiyear settlement agreement with the staff, which includes a 4-year rate plan with 5% annual increases in retail revenues for the first 3 years and no rate increase in the final year. This settlement also includes a gradually-increasing ROE during this multiyear period. Hearings on the settlement were held last week, and a final decision is expected from the North Dakota Commission this quarter. At SPS, our New Mexico requested $32.5 million rate increase is pending Commission's decision. On January 23, a hearing examiner provided a recommended decision, which included an ROE of 9.73% and a requested equity ratio of 53.9%. The recommendation did not include a revenue requirement calculation, but our initial analysis indicates a reduction to our base rate request of about $6 million, which results in a base rate increase of approximately $15 million. The recommended decision did not address the renewable writer. The Commission's decision is expected in April. In Texas, we recently filed for a net increase in electric rates of $52.7 million or 5.8%. We have requested the implementation of interim rates of $32.6 million, effective on March 1. Intervenor testimony is due in May and hearings are planned for June. We anticipate a final decision and the implementation of final rates in the third quarter. Turning to our financing plans. Today's press release summarizes our 5-year financing plans related to our $14 billion capital expenditure forecast. We plan to issue the following post-mortgage bonds during the first half of the year: approximately $300 million of both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo; approximately $150 million at SPS; and approximately $100 million at NSP-Wisconsin. We also have plans to issue equity during the next 5 years. While we don't plan to provide you with the specific timing of the equity issuance, I will point out that our CapEx program is front-end loaded, and we anticipate our equity issuance will likely be similar. With that, I will wrap up. Once again, we delivered 2013 earnings at the upper end of our guidance range. We're proud of our track record of generating the financial results that our investors expect. Operationally, we continue to provide our customers with a high level of service, even when faced with several severe weather events. We continue to make important investments in our system that position our company for long-term operational success, and will allow us to provide strong customer value for many decades to come. We are positioned to continue to deliver attractive shareholder returns well into the future. In summary, we're proud of our 2013 achievements and look forward to updating you on future successes in 2014. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. Please note, we've updated certain guidance assumptions to reflect 2013 actual results. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release. In particular, we have revised our depreciation assumption to reflect our proposed moderation plan in the Minnesota rate case. When we originally issued our guidance assumptions in the third quarter, it was prior to our filing of the Minnesota rate case. So we reflected a total then-expected increase in depreciation expense. The moderation plan, if approved, would reduce both revenue and depreciation expense by approximately $81 million, but wouldn't impact earnings per share. Therefore, this assumption change doesn't impact our guidance outlook. So with that, Calvin, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I'm just trying to better understand the change in the depreciation guidance. If you look at your Slide 7, it looks like you take the impact of a customer bill of $127 million, which I think is the interim rate relief, add the $81 million and the $16 million to get to a pretax impact on operating income of $224 million. So it looks from the slide, as if the $81 million is incremental to the $127 million, but that's -- but you said the opposite, I think, in terms of how we should think about it.
Teresa S. Madden: Well, if you start at the top of the $274 million, that's the growth request. And then we took out the $81 million, so that gets us to $193 million. So we've lowered the revenue, that's doing that, but the bottom depreciation expense were also. So we come to a net kind of cash more impact on the customer bill with a couple of those other items. But then, we also lowered depreciation expense. So we're basically lowering revenue and we're lowering depreciation expense, which gets us to that new -- that net $224 million.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: But -- okay. So for modeling purposes, because your drivers don't give the amount of rate relief, we should add -- or we can make an assumption of $127 million interim increase or whatever you think you're going to get in the case plus the $80 million, right?
Teresa S. Madden: Exactly.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then second question I have is there looks like there is a liability that's set up for a customer refund against the Sharyland gain of $7.6 million. Over what time period is that money refunded?
Teresa S. Madden: It's not determined. But it'll probably be likely in the next year or so. It -- they have just been -- we just reached those agreements with the Texas and New Mexico.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And last question for me is, what's the approximate timing of your next Colorado electric rate filing?
Teresa S. Madden: We probably anticipate mid-year.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk about the interest expense. Obviously, you did some issues in 2013 that were very favorable relative to what you redeemed, and you've got what you mentioned in terms of first half financing. What are your thoughts on how interest rate -- interest expense develops here in 2014?
Teresa S. Madden: In terms of -- well, we had some replacements. And particularly, we no longer have any more 8% debt. That was all basically retired in 2013. So we would expect with our new financings that we would be pretty comparable. We wouldn't expect to see such a significant decline as we did between '12 and '13.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And that's because you've also got the incremental financing?
Teresa S. Madden: We do have the incremental. But net-net, it's still is beneficial.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Right, okay. And the second, on the weather impact, could you break that down in terms of the revenue benefit and then with the higher cost related to the weather was in 2013?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, the higher cost, that would be difficult. I can tell you in terms of the company that, that would help you how the weather benefit went.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Sure. Yes, you put the EPS obviously in there. I just wondered how that breaks down.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Travis, this is Ben. The higher cost directly attributable would be the storms that we had that you could generally attribute to hotter, more volatile weather. But as we've also done, we also always pick the opportunity when we have weather to put -- a favorable weather -- to put some more money back into maintenance and those sorts of things, so we have a strong system going forward. It's a little bit harder to quantify.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of A. Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. One is, on loan growth, I see that you folks -- weather normalized, as I'm assuming 0.4% or so in '14. However, fourth quarter was up 1.1%, and I know it's just a quarter, but are you seeing a pickup in load growth? Is that a sign of optimism there? Can you just elaborate a bit on that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Ali, I'll start it off and then Teresa can add. I mean, I -- we did see a pickup in the quarter. But I think you have to -- we're always pretty cautious about a quarter, particular a quarter that's experienced some pretty volatile weather. Not only in total, but how it occurred within the month. And so you have to be a little bit careful. However, it is a favorable trend. I step back and compare the quarter to the overall year, and I think what we're seeing -- we'll continue to see SPS and PSCo do better than the North, and that we don't anticipate that trend will change into '14. You break it out a little bit further. Residential, generally, usage-wise, it would be flat -- PSCo's flat with usage. Every other jurisdiction's declining in usage. However, we're seeing customer additions again, consistent with where we were prerecession, so that's a good sign. But you put it all together and it still results in fairly flat residential revenues. And then on the C&I side, again, much more activity in the South and the West, and not so much in the North.
Teresa S. Madden: I think you covered that well, Ben. And I would agree, one quarter is probably not a trend.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the weather, I know we're early in the year. But any sense of how much cushion, if you will, this very cold January has given you guys as you're looking into '14 right now?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, Ali, I would say that Minnesota's been really cold. But Colorado's had some really warm days, too. So anybody watch the Bronco game.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: So we've been following the New York forecasts, too. I would agree with Teresa, it's been incredibly cold in Minnesota but pretty generally tempered in Colorado. And so you get the benefit, as we've always talked about, with a big portfolio of diversity. And weather is part of that diversity and sort of was a bit canceling each other out, to Teresa's point.
Teresa S. Madden: Right. Maybe it was slightly up, but it's not as much as everyone in Minnesota would think.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Our misery indicated here would...
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Right, right. We've been hearing about the Minnesota weather. But last year you had $0.11 of benefit versus normal. Just thinking, again, given what you're seeing so far, are you comfortable that you can match that so that weather doesn't become a headwind for you this year?
Teresa S. Madden: I mean, in terms of matching it, I mean, it's so early. Things can change in the weather, and I just wouldn't -- I think it's too early.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: If you notice -- I mean, our guidance, as you know, assumes normal weather, and that's what you have to count on. A little bit of positive in the first month. But the summer, it weighs on as much heavily than the winter, generally. So we just have to see how that plays out. We can't count on $0.11, that's for sure.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Right, right, right. And last question, Ben and Teresa. Remind us again, as you're looking at this Transco potential on the SPP region, et cetera, was that baked into your long-term earnings, growth guidance, the 4% to 6%? Does it move the middle further? Is it already in that? Can you just remind us how that fits into your outlook?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean, Ali -- I mean, it will allow us to continue to potentially invest in transmission. And that it's depending on how the rules actually play out in a FERC 1000 world, but this is -- the book of business that we talked about at analyst day is really based upon what we have today. So we're just putting these things in place. So several years down the road, we can continue to be as successful in building transmission as we already are. And it's, as I said and Teresa has said, it's another arrow on our quiver, and we need to have options because the future is always uncertain.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Well, it doesn't cause you to go above 6% or so. It still keeps you in that 4% to 6% range as you look at it today?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean -- I think, today, that would be the case rate.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: As I look at the capital expenditure forecast you've laid out that underlies the 4% to 6% average earnings for that expiration, I observed that it is somewhat front-end loaded. A lot of that capital spend happens in the first couple of years and then there is sort of a dramatic drop towards the back end. If you were to fully execute on all of those, all that spending in the first 2 years, even with the financing costs, the equity, as long as you're successful in your regulatory strategy, why wouldn't it be possible for you to earn towards the high end of the guidance range over the next few years?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Why wouldn't it be possible, is that what you just asked?
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. I mean, because you've got more capital, more rate base growth on the front end of the plan than the back end.
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I would just say in terms of exceeding it, we do have assumptions around rate cases. There still continues to be some regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, but we expect to see it be in our 4% to 6% growth range.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And then what makes you comfortable that the regulatory strategy you've implemented in Minnesota is going to drive a better outcome than the last case? I mean, so far, what could you point to in terms of your dialogue with your -- with the important counterparties in that case that gives you comfort you'll be able to get most of what you're asking for this time around?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, there's a lot of subjective and qualitative. But I think I'd point to the fact that interim rates were approved and without a lot of controversy. I think we're hearing qualitatively, that the quality of the data submission was very strong. The outreach efforts, the rate mitigation plan, I think, has been understood and, I would say, generally accepted by our stakeholders. They understand what we're doing. And remember, Greg, we -- while this, we're not asking for a 5-year plan. We've been talking to stakeholders what a 5-year plan looks like. And they understand that it's -- the pace of our rate increases that we've asked for, as we did things like extend the life of our nuclear plants for 20 years, it's going to start to level off. And so they understand that this isn't going to be a trend forever.
Teresa S. Madden: I would just add to that. I mean, the way we think about 2013, there were 3 significant things in that case that were in isolation, which we believe have been resolved. I mean, starting with the Monticello plant and the upgrade, the upgrade is complete. The plant has been operating since then. The Sherco plant, we had a catastrophic failure, that refurbishment is also complete. And then we had the sales forecast request in terms of the -- actually, decline, I should say. And we feel that we have much better forecasting that we'll do better on in this case. So I think that those 3 things are behind us, and so we feel better about this case going forward.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I'll just add, Greg. As we talked on investors’ day, we're offering great predictability moderation, we have addressed the issues upfront and investments actually reflect a carbon-free generation, which has been a preference of our customer. So that's why I think this case is different.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just with respect to Sharyland, I noticed this is an ongoing earnings, is there any other opportunity that you guys are seeing with that in terms of monetizing any other potential transmission assets?
Teresa S. Madden: In terms of divestiture?
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Yes.
Teresa S. Madden: No, not really. That was a very unique circumstance in terms of Sharyland and Caprock, who used to be a wholesale customer. And we just -- the transmission line, we didn't need it any longer. So...
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. I was wondering if you could tell me, with respect to the FERC Order 1000 and the right of first refusal, if you see any potential impact associated with competition, with respect to, perhaps, CapEx, or return or anything. I mean, how do you see that shaking out? Do you see opportunities outside? And do you see potentially competitive threats within your jurisdiction? Do you follow me?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. I mean, we have right of first refusals, for example, in Minnesota. But to your point, I think it's pretty clear FERC doesn't particularly care for those rights of first refusal. So we're not sure how that's going to play out. Right now, we don't see any immediate threat. But when you get out in the latter part of the decade, potentially, you could see the threat. And that's why, Paul, we want the Transco, because it allows us to compete on an even-keeled basis. It doesn't mean that, that threat will ever emerge. You can make a similar argument down in SPP in Texas and New Mexico. You also asked about ROE's. I mean, I think everybody knows that there are a number of pending cases in front of FERC to lower ROEs. That remains to be seen. Our FERC recoveries right now are not dependent upon -- or rather, our transmission recoveries now aren't really dependent upon FERC ROEs, but we'll have follow that. My personal opinion, I think you'll see some gap closure between a FERC ROE and what a typical state ROE is. But hopefully, not too much, because I think there's -- ROEs, hopefully, will improve at the state level. So hopefully, maybe FERC goes down a little bit and the state goes up. But we're prepared. And that's what the Transco does for us. We're prepared for different scenarios.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. I guess I was sort of really actually thinking about what you said to the return, and cost to capital was really actually on the competitive side. I mean, in other words, if FERC opens this all up to competition, do you see, I don't know, private equity investors or something like that coming in and perhaps using a variety of means to potentially come up with different return outlook? And I was wondering if that's something you have. I mean, I know it's early and what-have-you, but I was just wondering if you're hearing anything about that or...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I don't. I'm not really hearing probably any more than anybody else, but I think you raised a good point. And -- I mean, infrastructure funds would love to invest in transmission. But a couple of things about that. If you look at the rules to the extent they're out now and how competitive bidding would look, your track record, your performance, your operational standing, those are going to be very, very important criteria on who wins those bids. So maybe what you're suggesting, Paul, is that in a Transco or a partnering-type arrangement, could you have more passive partners along with a more active partner? Yes. I mean, that could happen. And again, that's a scenario that I think we're preparing for.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. And then just, finally, sort of a housekeeping thing. I noticed that it looked on Page 7, that residential sales were helped by weather considerably, yet there's sort of a slight hurt to weather for industrial and commercial. Is that because of where those customers are, and there were different weather impacts for different customer classes simply on location? Or is there something else going on sort of a small item? I was just wondering if it was a little unusual.
Teresa S. Madden: I don't think there's anything specific going on in across the jurisdictions. I will say, the weather normalization is more art than science. And when we do have extremes, and it's been said, particularly in a month, it would be really cold in the front part and warmer, that they're not perfect.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: And keep in mind that our larger industrials aren't -- or generally, their weather doesn't do much for them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's actually Julien here. So a quick question actually following up on the last year on the Transco front. Just really quickly, how has your thinking evolved about, A, the usage of partners as you just alluded to? And then, B, how would you structure this as it relates to FERC versus state level of returns and utility structures, if you will?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Julien, I guess I just have to repeat that we're not proposing any kind of structure at this point. We just want to have the Transco option in our back pocket so that we can react to how the market may evolve. And I -- we'll see how it evolves. In the meantime, we're going to focus on state recovered-type transmission, make sure that we improve the returns. You're going to see us continue to try to advance the regulatory construct in that regard, as with when we filed in Texas. And it really relates to revenue crediting and some -- I don't know if they're technical, but some real rate-type issues. And if we get that, a lot of our transmission spend in Texas and New Mexico will be recovered essentially outside of state retail mechanisms. So we don't -- we're really not thinking at this point that we're going to do a Transco into bringing passive partners, et cetera. But, I mean, Paul had asked earlier, is that a possibility? And sure, I see the market evolving that way. And we just want to be ready for it if it goes that way. And again, meantime, we've got great defined developing projects that are real, that we're going to get good recovery on in all of our jurisdictions, primarily at the state level right now.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. Excellent. And then looking at Colorado, I'd just be curious, as you think about your normalized sales growth numbers, obviously, there's been some commotion around a seller in that meeting. How does that impact your thinking on growth in the state? I mean, is it, at this point, immaterial to think about that? Or does it have any kind of...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: It's not immaterial. I mean, Teresa, you and I were just talking about this a couple of days ago. What do we estimate? Like there's that 0.2 percentage point that it shaves off our growth opportunity?
Teresa S. Madden: Right. Yes, it's not substantial. But if you -- for longer term, it will grow. But it's still not substantial.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I mean -- and that 0.2, that's for next year, you're saying, in Colorado?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, that's roughly. It's taking what we've seen and what we anticipate and what that would do. But it's already baked into the forecast. So that's -- so you should be aware of that. The issue with net metering is getting the rules right, so that the policy is sustainable for the long run. Today, it's not all that noticeable. But if the aspirations of the rooftop solar industry are met, it would be extremely noticeable to customers that don't have a rooftop. And so that's what the whole industry is rallying around and understanding that we have to get the right rules in place so that the technology can compete on an equal basis and not disadvantage one customer for the benefit of another.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And should we read on the utility scale side? Or anything into this way, just RFP around the Black Dog and putting forward a solar project in Minnesota? I mean, is that something that, frankly, at this point, you're going to -- you would pursue a separate RFP on the renewable side if they can do it? Or how are you thinking about that right now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, we've got a statue that we have to meet, and we take that seriously. And it's 1.5% by 2020, most of which would -- or at least 10% carved out for rooftop, the rest based upon our recommendations, essentially. So we understand that there's going to be solar in Minnesota, and we support that. But we think there's better ways to acquire it. And that's what our contention is. We think that we can do better for our customers if we did a separate RFP.
Teresa S. Madden: Right. Yes, we still believe that the Black Dog is the right, based on the current updated, 300-megawatt load is the right approach. And we just filed for reconsideration to that ALJ recommendation. So...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, and I think others -- the department, for example, thunders. It agrees with us. I mean, that there's a number of technical things that went behind the ALJ's decision. What they were looking at were actual load needs versus where we are today, what they were, how they were valuing solar as far as some societal benefits, et cetera. A number of things. Bottom line is, we haven't removed Black Dog from our CapEx. I mean, it's $100 million, it's fairly small. But it's because we think that this thing will get sorted out.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And then quickly on the wind side. I believe, last time you guys discussed the MISO interconnection study that was still pending for one of your new self-builds. Where does that stand?
Teresa S. Madden: We're still waiting for the results, but we're confident. We're, I should say, optimistic that it will come in where we expect it to come in.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think it does come in mid-year...
Teresa S. Madden: Yes. Well, first quarter-ish, yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. From what we're hearing, we're more optimistic today than we were yesterday, put it that way.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.
Andrew Levi: Actually, I'm all set, but thank you very much.
Teresa S. Madden: Well, with that, thank you for all participating in our year-end earnings call this morning. Please contact us, Paul Johnson and the IR team, with any follow-up questions. Thank you.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference call held on the 24th of October, 2013. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President, Group President and President and CEO of NSP-Minnesota; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our third quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments, discuss 2013 and 2014 guidance, as well as update our long-term earnings growth and dividend growth rates. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our web page. We will also post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on our website. Please note some of the remarks made during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. In addition, today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2013 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.73 per share reflect a $0.04 per share charge as a result of August 2013 FERC decisions regarding certain fuel and cost allocations at SPS. This issue relates to complaints by parties dating back to 2004 and 2006. These orders resulted in a refund liability for prior periods and consequently, we took a net $35 million pretax charge during the quarter. Details of this order are found in today's press release and 8-K, which we filed in August. Management believes ongoing earnings, which remove the impact of issues and charges related to prior periods, like the refund liability associated with the FERC orders, provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, the comments on today's call will focus on third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.77 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul, and good morning. Today, we are reporting 2013 third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.77 per share, a $0.01 per share decrease compared to $0.78 per share we reported 1 year ago. While weather was a $0.05 benefit this quarter, it was even greater than last year's third quarter at $0.08 per share. On a year-to-date basis, ongoing earnings are $1.65 per share compared to $1.54 per share last year. And while the final rate case in the Minnesota electric case was less than expected, the combination of favorable weather and management actions have positioned us to deliver 2013 ongoing earnings in the upper half of our guidance range, and this would mark the ninth consecutive year of meeting our annual earnings guidance. We're also initiating our 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05, which Teresa discuss in more detail in a few minutes. As you may recall 8 years ago, we announced our EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%, along with the dividend growth objective of 2% to 4%. I'm pleased to say we met these objectives on both the GAAP and an ongoing basis. During this time, we also improved our credit rating and our operational capability. As we look beyond 2013, we see EPS and dividend growth targets of 4% to 6%. Now the components of our value proposition have changed, we remain positioned to continue to deliver an attractive and competitive total return for many years to come. We are in the process of updating our capital forecast, and we continue to have excellent opportunities to invest in our utility operations. We will provide more clarity on our updated capital plan, as well as our plans to continue to reward our shareholders, at our Analyst Day in December. I'd now like to share a few recent operational successes with you. On our second quarter conference call, I discussed our successful storm recovery capabilities in Minnesota. Little did we know that those capabilities would be put to a test again so soon. In Boulder on September 9, it began raining and it didn't stop till a week later. Officially, 17 inches of rainfall, with certain parts of the region receiving over 20 inches. Now previously, the wettest September have been 5.5 inches. The rainfall caused catastrophic damage to Boulder, as well as adjacent communities. I'm proud to say that we again demonstrated our ability to restore customers quickly and safely in a very challenging situation. And this storm caused extensive damage to critical infrastructure, including our natural gas delivery system in the Boulder area. We have identified approximately 20 miles of natural gas pipe and thousands of natural gas and electric meters that require a replacement due to water damage. We are working diligently and safely to get service restored to all of our customers in the region and have restored everyone that can be connected at this time. In some cases, we're making temporary repairs with permanent repairs scheduled for next year. From a generation side of our business, we recently brought back 2 of our base load plants Our Monticello nuclear facility returned to service in August, following an outage where we had completed life extension and extended -- and the extended power upgrade project. This fall, Sherco 3 returned to service following the unit's catastrophic failure in late 2011. As a result, Sherco 3 will return to used and useful status in our 2014 Minnesota rate case, which should resolve a issue from our last case. It's important to note that the majority of the restoration cost will be covered by insurance. Therefore, the cost of repairs will not impact customer bills. Turning to our current project. We recently began a scheduled outage at Prairie Island nuclear facility, which is necessary for the 20-year life extension. During this outage, we replaced the steam generators at Unit 2. As you know, we've already successfully replaced the steam generators at Unit 1. As we mentioned last quarter, we are pursuing the addition of up to 1,900 megawatts of wind across all of our jurisdiction. Adding these resources today creates long-term value that could save our customers over $800 million in fuel costs over the next 20 years. I'd now like to update you on where we stand with our proposals to add wind as well as thermal resources. At NSP, we are proposing to add 400 megawatts of wind through power purchase agreement and 350 megawatts of wind that we would own. The Minnesota Commission approved these wind projects last week, and the North Dakota commission is expected to rule later this year. We will also need the results from a final MISO study to determine the transmission interconnection costs for the projects, which we do expect to receive in the first quarter of 2014. The transformation study is important to ensure that the final cost remain economical for our customers. For the natural gas, our THI in Minnesota, we recommended that the lowest cost option for our customers would be a 215-megawatt CT plant addition at our Black Dog plant and a power purchase agreement with either Calpine or Invenergy. We anticipate an ALJ recommendation by year end with the final commission decision in the first quarter of 2014. Colorado, we filed proposal with the commission to add 170 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of wind and 317 megawatts of low-cost natural gas generation. All of these requested resources would be acquired via power purchase agreement. In October, we received commission approval for the wind power purchase agreement. These additions will bring PSCo's total wind capacity in Colorado to more than 2,600 megawatts. The commission is expected to decide on a solar and natural gas generation proposals in early December. So financially, operationally, we remain on track and positioned for future success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. I'll begin by providing a brief overview of our third quarter results at each of our 4 operating companies. Third quarter ongoing earnings at PSCo decreased $0.03 per share, primarily due to higher depreciation, O&M expenses and cooler summer weather. Ongoing earnings at NSP-Minnesota increased $0.03 per share for the quarter. Quarterly results were positively impacted by electric rate increases in Minnesota and South Dakota, North Dakota interim electric rates and lower interest charges. SPS ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for the quarter. A rate increase in Texas didn't fully offset higher O&M expenses, depreciation and interest charges and the impact of cooler summer weather. Finally, third quarter ongoing earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to higher electric and gas rates that were implemented in the first quarter of this year. I will now review the key drivers on the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Despite $46 million in retail rate increases across several states, third quarter's gas electric margins decreased $24 million. As Paul noted in his introductory remarks, we took a net $35 million pretax charge during the quarter related to the August SPS FERC rehearing orders. Of this amount, $26 million was related to electric revenues for periods prior to 2013, $5 million was related to 2013 electric revenues and approximately $4 million was for interest charges. We are excluding the $26 million associated with years prior to 2013 from our ongoing electric margin. Adjusted for this reclassification, electric margin increased $2 million during the quarter. Going forward, we anticipate the annual revenue impact of these orders could be up to $6 million in 2014, decreasing to $4 million in June 2015. Other factors that contributed to the decrease in third quarter electric margin were: A $20 million estimated impact from cooler summer weather versus last year; $17 million from decreased conservation and DSM incentive and $11 million from an estimated earnings test refund obligation at PSCo. Third quarter weather normalized retail electric sales increased 0.3%. On a year-to-date normalized basis, electric sales increased 0.1% and we are remarkably close to our internal projection. Our 2013 electric sales guidance is for 0% to 0.5% growth. Natural gas margins rose $5 million, primarily due to an interim rate increase in Colorado. Turning to expenses. O&M increased $43.8 million or 8.2% during the third quarter, and $90.9 million or 5.8% for the year-to-date period. Several factors drove the higher O&M expense during the quarter, including electric and gas distribution expenses associated with vegetation management, storms and outages. Nuclear outage amortization and other nuclear expenses and higher employee benefits related primarily to increased pension expense. We continue to project that our 2013 annual O&M expenses will increase 4% to 5%. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.6 million or 4.4%. As part of the final electric rate case order in Minnesota, NSP-Minnesota reduced depreciation expense $24 million during the third quarter. This reduction was offset by increased depreciation from normal system expansion. I'll now provide an update on a few of our regulatory proceedings. In Minnesota, we plan to file a multiyear electric rate case in early November. The primary drivers of the request will be related to our significant capital investment program. We intend to file a 2-year rate case. The first year will be a full 2014 test year. The second year will consist of a step increase primarily for specific capital projects, but also for related property taxes and chemicals for emission controls. Consistent with the commission's multiyear claimed order, we intend to reduce our use of riders and instead recover certain investments through the multiyear plan. Our recently approved wind investments will be included in the 2015 portion of our request. Our rate case is driven by our investments in steam generator replacement projects at Prairie Island, the Monticello upgrade and life extension, the return of Sherco 3 to service as well as increases in our nuclear O&M costs and property taxes. FOr these reasons, we expect this to be a sizable request. As a result, we intend to propose a rate plan to moderate the level of rate increases and keep it within a more predictable range for our customers over the next several years. We know that there are inherent challenges associated to filing back-to-back rate cases. And therefore, we've been meeting with stakeholders to help provide them with an understanding of the key drivers of our costs and the need to file at this time. We believe the parties are open to discussing a longer term framework, and we will continue to work with them on this approach. Finally, we plan to file a more comprehensive set of testimony and information to provide additional support for our position and to assist the various parties with their review of our case. Also in Minnesota, we made our prudence filing related to our Monticello life extension and power upgrade project. As Ben mentioned, the project was recently completed and Monticello is back up and online. We expect that the NRC will issue licenses for the plant to operate at the higher output levels later this year or early next year. The Monticello life extension power upgrade project was a highly complex undertaking than in many ways was more complicated than the original plant construction. The initiative, which dates back to 2003, involve the replacement of hundreds of pieces of equipment, requires thousands of workers and resulted in a largely rebuilt plant. The parts of the project evolved from the original estimate of $320 million in 2008 to $665 million due to increased federal regulatory standards and schedules, higher installation costs and a broader scope than originally anticipated. Completing the project took longer and cost more than we anticipated, but it was essential that it be done right, and we believe we made reasonable decisions along the way. Finally, it is important to recognize that the upgrade to Monticello will benefit customer for years to come and were completed at a cost consistent with similar projects at other nuclear facilities across the country. Turning to Colorado, on October 22, the ALJ issued a recommended decision in the Colorado natural gas case. The report is 159 pages and doesn't include a specific revenue requirements calculation. As a result, it will take us a few days to analyze and determine the recommended rate increase. However, some of the ALJ recommendation are consistent with PSCo's decision and include a prepaid pension asset remains in rate base, approval of PSCo's pension expense adjustment, approval of PSCo's annual incentive plan cost, approval of PSCo's pro forma historical tax [ph] year property tax adjustment of $7.1 million, and an equity ratio of 56% based on an actual year end capital structure. Additional recommendations include PSCo's revenue requirements will be based on a historic test year, not a forecast test year. The rate case should be based on a single year, not a multiyear rate plan and an ROE of 9.72%. It is important to recognize that these are recommended decisions. We plan to file exceptions to the report on November 1. The Colorado Commission makes the final decision, and it is expected to rule on the natural gas case before year end. Details regarding our regulatory proceedings in Wisconsin, North Dakota and New Mexico can be found in our earnings release. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our earnings guidance for 2013 and 2014. Our strong year-to-date results position us to deliver ongoing earnings in the upper half of our $1.85 to $1.95 per share guidance range. If achieved, this would represent the fourth year in a row in which our ongoing earnings have been in the upper half of our guidance range. We continue to expect GAAP EPS will be within our guidance range. Looking ahead, we're initiating 2014 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per share. This range assumes constructive outcomes in all rate case in regulatory proceedings, including the implementation of interim rate. Other key guidance assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. We provided a $0.10 EPS guidance range ever since 2004 when our guidance range was $1.15 to $1.25 per share. As our projected earnings approach to $2 per share level, we think it is appropriate to widen the guidance range to $0.15 per share to capture the natural variability of earnings. We also think it's appropriate to have the low end of the range start at the midpoint of our 2013 guidance range or a normalized EPS of $1.90 per share, which represents the starting point for our 4% to 6% EPS growth objectives. In closing, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, which positions the company to meet our earnings objective for the ninth consecutive year. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Kit Konolige from BGC.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: On the -- your sales growth outlook, I believe you said that you are expecting 0% to 0.5% in 2013. Can you discuss the breakdown by states on that and maybe any color about commercial versus industrial versus residential? And also give us a view of the longer term sales outlook that you're seeing at this point?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, sure, Kit. Let's start with the 2013 by the states. Minnesota, we're still projecting a decline of about 1.2%. In NSP-Wisconsin, just a slight decline. And then the other 2 jurisdiction, PSCo slightly up and SPS at about 1.2% range. But all of it netting to within the -- up to 0.5%. When we look to the future, we're looking at about, as we indicated in our guidance up to 0.5%, those are narrowing, not such a great degree in terms of the decline in NSP-Minnesota. In terms of the various classes of customers, it does vary by jurisdiction. I will say that C&I, we see the most growth in Texas with the oil and gas industry boom.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Kit, I would just add that our forecasting abilities for sales have really been very, very accurate this year, and we believe heading into next year too. I think we really got our arms around what's happening with the economy and how that relates to our sales growth.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: So you're expecting -- is it fair to summarize that you're saying you're expecting, netted around the various states roughly flattish to slightly up sales growth over kind of the middle to longer term?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, that's correct.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: And what -- I mean that's lower obviously than historically. What trends are you attributing that to, just economics, energy efficiency?
Teresa S. Madden: All of those, yes.
Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: Right, Okay. It sounds like I have that part of the note written already then.
Teresa S. Madden: Good.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thanks, Kit.
Operator: And the next question comes from -- let me quickly gather details, Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First on O&M, the O&M growth embedded here in 2014 guidance is 2% to 3% versus the 4% to 5% from this year. What's driving the lower sequential rate? Is that pension or is also process improvement? And should we take that 2% to 3% and extrapolate that as the long-term growth rate that you're targeting?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, in terms of the 2% to 3%, yes, pension is contributing to that. We did say that 2013 was going to be our high mark. also, we are assuming that likely, we'll have some uptick in the discount rate. But we are also seeing some -- we are working towards improvement, process improvements on the operational side of our business. And in terms of our overall growth rate, if we look to the future, we do intend to keep them lower than our historical 4% where we've been at.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. And on the wind project, if that's approved, when will the CapEx impact? Is that 2015, or is there any CapEx bet in 2014? And then can you provide some more clarity on this MISO study? What specifically is the scope of what they're looking at?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, let's start in terms of the wind projects. There's a very small amount in 2014. The lion's share of the estimated spend will be in, actually it's in the latter part of 2015 around the third quarter. Because they are anticipated to go in service by the end of that year. The MISO study is really related to some interconnections and some paths primarily what will be required. So we need to have the completion of that study to ultimately determine what the cost will be for those transmission paths what we are required.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: All right. And the last question is the major objectives for the Analyst Day on December 4 with -- is that when we can expect the CapEx refresh for Xcel?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, that's right, Neil, you can expect that, as Teresa mentioned, these wind projects will drive some CapEx needs, will refresh everything. I said in my remarks, I think we continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest in our utilities, and we'll update you on that. We'll update you on where we see the value proposition and give you a general operational and financial update.
Operator: And the next question comes from Paul Fremont from Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I guess my first question is you talk about a potentially substantial filing in Minnesota. The last filing I think was close to $300 million. Should we be looking at something in that range? And can you remind us what percent was the $285 million that you were requesting in terms of percentage increase?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think the -- correct me if I'm wrong, Scott or Teresa, I think the $285 million was like 11%.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes. I was in the 10s.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, okay. And at this point, we don't want to get any more specific other than to tell you we know it'll be a significant case. And we know putting rate moderation programs in place are going to be very beneficial to making the -- hope we make in the outcome of the case constructive and successful. It obviously reflects a lot of capital costs and mutually related as well as just general infrastructure. So I think we're in pretty good shape. It's going to be significant. We've talked about that before. It's the reason why we also we're sharing with our stakeholders what it looks like over a 5-year horizon. And we think the pace of rate increases will moderate significantly in the next few years.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Ben, I know a year ago the commission have talked about sort of changing the rules for the -- or the requirements for the interim increase? Were any changes made? Or is it essentially the same as it would have been when the $251 million went into effect in January?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think there -- I mean there's a couple of things that have changed. I mean one, as you know, they changed how the methodology of calculation -- calculating the refund obligation works. And we did have a court order that essentially gives the commission a little more flexibility in how they grant interim rates. And frankly, we're aware of that. And we've incorporate that into our moderate -- rate moderation plans.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then the wind projects that have already been approved in Colorado and in Minnesota, can you give us sort of a dollar amount of construction associated with the approved projects?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, well of course, the ones that are on the power purchase agreements, they're in the -- a better way to describe that to you is with their levelized prices are, and that's in the $25 to $35 range. In terms of the ones that we have the opportunity to own, I think we're looking at just rough figures in what is it, 1,700 to 2,100 of KWs, something around that?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, around there.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes, 1750 per KW installed would be an average cost that you see in the industry. You can take that times the 350 and come up with an estimate of the capital.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: It works out to the a very good levelized cost for our customers. And again, these prices are so compelling that it's -- I mean, the energy associated with it is less than what you can do locked in a 20-year gas strip for. Hence, the 800 million plus of fuel savings. We're getting the environmental, we're getting the capacity savings that these projects bring. So we're really excited about it.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And the last thing, the 2014 guidance, I assume, carries forward the ongoing impact of the FERC order. And is there a possibility of getting that overturned?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, it does include the ongoing impact or potential impact from that. We have filed for re-hearing. We think our positions are strong. So we feel good about that. But we do have that incorporated into our projections for 2014.
Operator: And the next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Listen. First question, the 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth rate, what time period roughly should we be thinking about? Is that a 5-year growth rate? 3 years? And what associated rate base growth should we assume is embedded in that growth rate target?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I mean, Ali, it's long term, so we could say 3 -- 3 to 5 years. In terms of the rate base growth, really no different than we've been talking to you on the front end, over the 5 years, potentially after like 5%. But there is still the front-end load. This year, we have high capital to spend. We'll start to taper down, we'll have some moderation, assuming we would move forward with the 15 wind projects. I mean, we are, assuming we will move forward, pending the final approvals. But that's really what the landscape looks like.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And also, are you assuming pretty much flattish trends in terms of earned ROEs over that period or any improvement? Or how should we think about that?
Teresa S. Madden: And generally, pretty flat over that period.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Ali, as you know, over the last several years, we've been around that consolidated ROE of 10%. And given the macroeconomic environment we're in, I think that's a pretty good assumption going forward.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the dividend policy, I wanted to get a little more insight. I know you guys have been saying in the past that as the earnings growth starts to taper down, you start to get more aggressive on the dividend. So we see that the dividend growth is now in line with EPS. Previously, it was slightly below. The fact of the matter is, Ben or Teresa, that your payout ratio is still probably lower than your peer group. And so if you keep dividend in line with earnings, you keep it at that payout ratio. So any sort of thoughts on that? I would have thought you may have wanted to grow dividend at a faster pace than earnings? So any insights in your thinking there?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, I think we started with giving you the clarity that the dividend growth rate objective is now 4 to 6. We know that our dividend payout ratio is modest compared to our peers, and that's a good thing. So we've got lots of options going forward in what we do and how we do it and the various options you can reward shareholders. Obviously, that's a very important topic that we'll discuss with our board. And we'll look at a number of factors, CapEx, macroeconomic conditions, credit rating objectives, you name it. It's -- we look at it. And I mean, I'm excited that we can continue to offer such a compelling value proposition. And I think it's the hallmark of what we've been able to accomplish. And one thing, as I pointed out on my notes is, we actually do hit our objectives. We've got a history of that. So I hope everybody takes comfort in that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And last question, Ben, when you had laid out the last 5-year CapEx program, in there you had embedded, I think it was about 800 million of equity or it's about 400 million with this after-market program that you have put out there. As you think about these new wind projects, assuming they do come in. And I think you've said that you assume that they do come in. And doing the math, another $650 million, $700 million of CapEx, what does that do to your thinking about equity in the mix, as you look forward now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Do you want to take that one or you want me to...
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I mean -- maybe the short answer, Ali, is we really do plan to discuss the whole, complete plan at our Analyst Day. So we'll be revising and refreshing all of that when we meet with you at that time. So...
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Is it fair to say, we should assume more equity just given the additional in CapEx and the balance between equity and that? Is that fair to think about?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Let's -- first of all, let's make sure that projects are finally approved, and we'll share that capital forecast. As you know, timing of the capital forecast is pretty important when it comes to any equity needs. I think the bottom line is our equity needs are very modest going forward, I mean. So I don't think that will be a big issue but we certainly can give you more clarity at the Analyst Day.
Teresa S. Madden: I agree with that.
Operator: And the next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Quick follow-up on the dividend. Have you given out a payout ratio guidance or just the growth rate?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: At this point, just the growth rate.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. Is it fair to assume that implied 60%, if we go out to guidance 2014 and apply the growth rate, is that about where you're comfortable?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think we're just comfortable right now on the 4 to 6. And we're going to -- obviously, as I said just previously, we'll discuss various ways we can reward shareholders within that target with our board. And again, we know we have a modest payout ratio. We also have outstanding credit ratings and excellent opportunities to continue to invest in our utility operations.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then quick on the gas usage growth. I mean, you guys posted really good gas usage growth for the last several quarters. I was wondering if you could characterize the continuing trend, whether you see that continuing, if there's fundamental developments there? Just kind of what's going on over the last few quarters to drive that 4% to 5%?
Teresa S. Madden: I mean, I think, I would characterize it as maybe an aberration. We are watching it. I would say that our weather normalization, is very cold. It's primarily in PSCo in the early part of the year. We may have some aberrations with that. As you can see, when we look to '14, we're actually projecting some decreases. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily, we'll continue to watch ongoing long-term trend to see that uptick at that level.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Do you think there's been a material response given the decline in gas prices? Do you think that's a driver and that if you gas prices going to 6, 7, that you'd see a significant pullback? Or is that not necessarily relevant?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I think in general, with anything when gas prices go up, people potentially monitor their use. So it's depending how much and when.
Operator: And the next question comes from Neil Kalton from Wells Fargo.
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just as a quick question on EPS guidance for '14 and specifically the low end, which is flat with 2013, really. So what kind of has to happen to see flat year-over-year? What should we specifically be sort of looking out for, I guess?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I think there are several things that could affect next year, but we talked about the Minnesota case and all our rate cases that we have out there. We are assuming, as we always do in terms of when we initiate guidance and constructive outcomes in terms of those rate cases. Now if there was some deviation from that, that could be a factor. But there's other things, too, O&M variation, sales, the whole list of things that could occur.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think -- I mean, Teresa said it. But I also just think -- I mean, we didn't achieve what we started out to achieve this year with the Minnesota rate case. I mean, I think everybody knows that. And as both myself and Teresa talked about, we have the fortunate uptick for weather. That mitigated a lot of it. We had some management initiatives that mitigated the rest of it, positioning us very well for this year. But of course, you can't count on weather next year. And while I think we are as best positioned as we possibly can be for these '14 phase. I mean, it's certainly going to be a big driver of our success next year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
Unknown Analyst: This is Paul Zimbata [ph] from Julien's team. Just a quick question on the Minnesota multiyear rate case. If you could just talk about decision to file in November with running at the suboptimal level and without the NRC license, if you think that, that will have any kind of implication?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: At suboptimal level, I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about. What's that?
Unknown Analyst: Same that you were [indiscernible]
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I'm sorry, I misheard you. I'm sorry, Paul.
Teresa S. Madden: Me too!
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, first of all, the Monticello we expect, even as the shutdown delayed it a bit. But we expect the Monticello license, the first piece of it, to come through in late November, possibly early December, and with the approval for the final piece, maybe as early as March 2014. So I don't think that the NRC license will be a significant factor in the rate case. Does that answer your question? Because I apologize for not understanding it.
Unknown Analyst: That's okay. Yes, that was it.
Operator: And the next question comes from Chris Turnure from JPMorgan.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I have a question kind of in that vein, but more specifically on the Monticello up-rate prudence case. Is the NRC license going to impact the timing of how that progresses? And then kind of second there, is there a precedence that we can kind of look to to understand how they are going to treat and look at that overrun versus the original estimate?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, let me kick it off and we've got the experts sitting by my side here. I don't -- first of all, I don't think the NRC timing of that won't impact the prudence proceeding. I also think if you -- there's a number of different ways that historically, commissions look at prudence review. And the traditional way, we've make decisions at various points in the project life, I think we feel pretty comfortable about. We did have overruns. But if you look around the industry, so did everybody else. These up-rates have turned out to be much more expensive. And then finally, despite the increased costs, we certainly would have gone forward with the project at $11 gas when this project started. And frankly, it still makes sense for our consumers today. So I think we're in pretty good shape there.
Teresa S. Madden: The key component in our portfolio mix, as we look forward, and we think nuclear has a good position versus what...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Electricity [ph] carbon free. I mean, Dave or Scott, I don't know if you want to add anything?
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then the second question is around the mitigation efforts going into the general rate case in November. You gave a little bit of color in the press release today, but I was just wondering if you could talk more about that, flesh it out a little bit and give more color around how the discussions with the intervenors are progressing so far?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I'll start. And then you guys can -- in terms of we did, as you know, in the 2013 case, the commission made an adjustment relative to theoretical reserve and an 8-year amortization. So we're looking at some alternatives around that. That would be a primary one. And then potentially, we have some daily refunds. That would be the second. But more to come on that as we go forward. If you 2 want to talk about the stakeholders?
Scott M. Wilensky: Hi, this is Scott. I would just say we've been trying to work with folks to get them to understand why we're coming back here in November, to make sure they understand the drivers of our costs and which plants are affecting that, which plant additions. And I think that overall, people are working with us, receptive to the fact that we are looking at a moderation plan and understanding that our costs are increasing in a period that's sort of peakish. And that we'll try to smooth that out.
Operator: And the next question comes from Angie Storozynski from company Macquarie.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: First of all, I wanted to actually thank you for finally giving us a sense of what is the new long-term growth rate for earnings because with your comment in the past that it would be a deceleration in earnings growth past '14. We were kind of scrambling, is it 2%? Is it 3%? So I think that that's -- provides a lot clarity, the 4% to 6%. Now on the -- again, the Minnesota rate case, the multiyear aspect of it, how should we think about it? I mean, did you hear from intervenors that they will be receptive to a multiyear rate case? And also, given the less-than-satisfying outcome of the last rate case, I mean, should we expect that if this rate case doesn't go well, there's going to be another one filed just after the current one? So are we basically -- is the strategy to basically file rate cases until you get what is required to have a profitable business in Minnesota?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, let me take a stab at this. I mean we're working with stakeholders now because we don't want to be in that continual rate case loop, and neither does the commission, the staff or our customers. That said, I don't think anybody thinks that the capital we're spending and the expenses we're incurring aren't for good use. It's pretty much evidenced in what we were able to accomplish here over the summer. We had half of our customers out. So we're making the right investment decisions. I think a multiyear plan, and Scott alluded to it, helps moderate rates today, recognizing that the pace of rate increases modulates significantly the further out in time you go. So our plan is to be successful in this case. And to replicate what I think has been a pretty good model and I think has been pretty successful in Colorado for all stakeholders, shareholders alike, customers alike. So it's not our plan to file rate cases continuously.
Teresa S. Madden: Maybe, Ben, I would just add to that in terms of the stakeholder input that we see. They were actually suggesting the 2-year case. And so I mean, clearly, we're having I would say a positive dialogue and we have taken some of their input. And that's part why we're filing the 2-year case instead of potentially what was allowed, the 3-year case.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, essentially, to Teresa's point, it's a 5-year look and see. And so I think everybody is open to what we're trying to accomplish. I also think, too, we're -- we got some I think very good programs to continue to be more efficient. And we recognized that's what we need to do. Teresa mentioned we'll see our pace of O&M and certainly out by pension. It's going to be also helped by a lot of productivity improvements, with process improvements, et cetera which -- I'm not talking about deferred maintenance, I'm talking about improved processes. So I think -- I mean, obviously, it's a big case. But I think based on what we heard today, we are cautiously optimistic. It will go well.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: I know that you're not providing any details about the filing ahead of it. But I mean, how big an impact roughly speaking would it have on electric bills? Would the increase be significantly above the inflation level?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: What is inflation?
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research: Well, optimistically, let's assume 2% to 3%.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think you're going to find our rate moderation plans are going to be in that zone of reasonableness that stakeholders would be open to.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: A quick one on Teresa, I appreciate your comments on the gas sales forecast for 2014. And you'd said maybe some of the growth have been a bit of an aberration in the weather numbers perhaps. Is negative 2 just giving back some of that noise? Or is that a better handle on what you see as underlying growth?
Teresa S. Madden: I would probably go with the former, potentially. A little bit hard to say, but...
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So is it -- once you've kind of adjust for maybe what was surprising this year, is your underlying outlook is more flattish like for electric?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes.
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Right. And then if I may, just on the sales topic, is there -- you're obviously talking 0% to 0.5%. Let's just -- and Ben, I heard your comments about feeling you've got your arms around the drivers. Let's just say it was 0% to negative 0.5%. Is that a very -- is that -- would that be enough to put you outside of your trajectory on 4% to 6%? Or do you think you have enough other things you can do to sort of maintain it, in the event that you did see kind of sustained modest shrinkage?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, that's -- I don't think so. It would be my initial reaction.
Teresa S. Madden: I would agree. Put us outside of the range, we could look at that [indiscernible]
Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It would lead you to the bottom of it, but not outside? Is that...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I don't -- I mean, it will be really difficult to give you an answer to that because there are so many other factors, where it would occur, what our regulatory mechanisms were. I think we've got far more flexibility than just the 50 basis points movement in sales, significantly altering our long-term growth expectations.
Operator: And the next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital.
Andrew Levi: We were also happy to see you get the growth rate out there as well because there was definitely a lot of concern, I guess. So 5% is pretty good. Just a couple of questions. On the 4% to 6%, what gets you to the high end? What gets you to the low end? Can you kind of go into that? And obviously, you talked a little bit about flexibility you have as far as sales volumes? And that has to do with customer class, too. But just any color you can give us on high end versus low end of the growth rate?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I would, me and Teresa, I would do the easy part and Teresa can do the other part. I think that clearly on the top end, what we would want to do is see improvement in our earned ROEs. And of course, in this interest rate environment, authorized ROEs, I would say that will be a stretch. But you've heard us talk before, if we could close the gap between actual earned and authorized, that would be one piece of it. Continuing to have a capture rate base growth opportunities, investment opportunities would be another. We talked just in the last call with Jonathan about sales growth. Of course, positive sales growth certainly would be supportive. and all those factors go the other way to get you on the low end.
Teresa S. Madden: Great. I think you've covered the key items, but ROE [indiscernible]
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: O&M?
Teresa S. Madden: Oh, sure.
Andrew Levi: Okay. Just 2 more questions. I don't know if I'm just reading into this or is it just -- is it really just 4% to 6%. But on the dividend, you mentioned that there are a lot of options that you'd like to discuss with the board relative to where the payout ratio is. Can you discuss what those options are?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, I think you heard a lot of the callers trying to understand what the pace of that is going to be. I mean, if there's going to -- I mean, we're going to have a dividend payout ratio target, et cetera. So I -- again, I don't know if we can provide any more clarity. I mean we have discussions, as you would guess, with our board routinely around the dividend because we -- as we do with other value part of -- the value components of our value proposition, and it's an important topic. We'll continue to have these discussions. The good news is that we can have these discussions about how we're going to reward shareholders, because we do have a modest payout ratio and we are now aligning our dividend growth with EPS growth. So I know everybody wants more clarity. But let's just start with that objective, and we'll give you more clarity on that as time goes on.
Andrew Levi: What is the timing on getting that clarity? What is typically is the board meeting that you generally have this discussion?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, we have an Analyst Day in December. We typically have made dividend announcements for the last 5 years now at our shareholders' meeting. You're not bound by that. But I mean, I guess that would be kind of the guidance I would give you.
Andrew Levi: Okay. And your payout ratio right now based on your 2014 guidance is around 55%, 56%. Why not take the payout ratio up to 60% to 65% based on your profile?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I guess I'm just going to repeat what we said. I mean, we know we have a payout ratio that is modest. Of course, we've had that for a number of years now. And I think it's extremely important, and I'm not going to speak for my board, but it's extremely important that you have a sustainable, predictable dividend. And we've provided that for many, many years now. We'll continue to provide that for many years to come.
Paul A. Johnson: I think the other thing I would point, Andy, if you look at the midpoint of 2013 guidance range, payout ratio is probably more like 58%.
Andrew Levi: Yes, I'm just talking more on '14 and what type of increase we can see in '14...
Paul A. Johnson: If the earnings and the dividends are growing at a similar rate, the payout ratio is not going to change.
Andrew Levi: And then the last question has to do with the stock and kind of again looking at the midpoint of guidance. And so if you kind of took that 4% to 6% and you took it out to '15, the stock itself, on a valuation base is relative to the regulator group. So pulling out some of the gas you named have traded much higher multiples. Is trading at about 6% discount despite the 5% earnings growth rate and this dividend growth rate as well. How as a management do you think you've closed that gap and get back to where you used to actually trade at a premium to the group now trading at a substantial discount?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I hope, one, continue to remind people that we've had a successful track record of delivering shareholder value and then two, on a prospective basis, making sure we continue to deliver shareholder value. And clearly, I think, we've had some overhang on with the pace and frequency of our regulatory filings. Going to multiyears, I think we'll provide more clarity on that so I think that will be helpful. Continuing to work on closing the gap between earned and authorized, ROE would be another process and continuing to make progress. But the reality is we've delivered a pretty good track record here. And I think we're positioned to continue to do that. And so I think it's a matter of time before people recognize that.
Operator: The last question comes from Ashar Khan from the company Visium.
Ashar Khan: Can I just ask you, Ben, I guess, we go through this in different states going through that in New York, over here. I was just looking, Minnesota has a gubernatorial election next year. Can this rate case become part of any issue or no? Arguably, the elections have been immune to what's happening on...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean, that's a great question and I just will tell you that everybody here is shaking their heads no. I mean, we do not anticipate that the rate case will be a political issue in this election.
Teresa S. Madden: All right. Well, thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in a few weeks. In addition, we hope many of you will attend our analyst meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on December 4. We plan to update you on our efforts to spend the O&M cost per pound, our Minnesota electric rate case, our nuclear construction projects and rate base opportunities. And until then, Paul Johnson and the IR team are available to take your call. Thanks a lot.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: See you later, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-01 11:00:00) =====

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, August 1, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our second quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments, reiterate our 2013 guidance. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our webpage. We will also post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on the webpage. As always, some of our comments during this morning's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that cause results to differ than those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.40 per share compared with $0.38 per share in 2012. New and interim rates in several jurisdictions, combined with positive weather, contributed to our solid quarterly earnings. We also remain positioned to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95 per share. In a few moments, Teresa will discuss our financial results and regulatory developments in greater detail. I'll now comment on a few recent events, starting with some operational items. I believe the foundation of a strong utility is how it responds to adversity, particularly large-scale storms. In June, we had an opportunity to demonstrate our capabilities when Minnesota experienced several severe thunderstorms and high winds that impacted over 600,000 of our customers. Advanced preparation for these types of events enable us to successfully coordinate a workforce of 1,100 linemen and hundreds of support personnel, including crews from several other utilities. As a result, 96% of our customers were restored within 3 days, and everyone was back online by the sixth day. I'm proud that our dedicated employees, contractors and utility peers completed this enormous effort in an orderly, safe and timely fashion. In addition, I want to thank all the other utilities who provided employees to assist us with storm restoration. The Mutual Assistance Program is an outstanding way for utilities to leverage our workforces, to respond to significant storms in a cost-effective and efficient manner. I'd now like to discuss the completion of a long-term project to upgrade and extend the life of our Monticello nuclear plant. In July, we brought our Monticello nuclear plant back online after completing a scheduled refueling outage, which included work to allow the plant to operate safely through 2030 and increase its output by 71 megawatts. Scope of this project changed several times as we worked to meet evolving NRC standards for safety, increased the reliability margin and address emergent issues that were discovered during the construction. Our cost for the project are approximately $655 million, which is above the estimate provided in our 2008 Certificate of Need filings. We have committed to an after-the-fact prudence review. We expect that the overall cost and benefits of the project will be reviewed in the context of our 2014 rate case. We believe that even with the cost increases, this project will deliver great value for our NSP customers, providing 600 megawatts of reliable, cost-efficient and emission-free generation for the next 2 decades. We also are pursuing plans to substantially increase our emission-free wind resources. We're always looking for options that work for both customers and investors. Consistent with this approach, we're seeking to add as much as 2,000 megawatts of wind resources across our service territory at very attractive pricing. These projects allow us to take advantage of the expiring production tax credits, meet state renewable standards and provide significant fuel savings to our customers. To this end, we submitted a proposal to regulators to add 600 megawatts of wind resources in Minnesota and North Dakota. Our proposal includes adding 3 200-megawatt projects, including 1 ownership project. At SPS, we're seeking to add 700 megawatts of wind power through PPAs. In Colorado, we're proposing adding 200 megawatts of new wind through our PPA. In addition to these 1,500 megawatts of proposed wind projects, the Colorado PUC will decide this fall on whether or not to approve 350 megawatts of new wind PPAs. We're also evaluating our 150-megawatt project in North Dakota that we would own. This project may be brought to the North Dakota and Minnesota Commissions relatively soon. Adding wind resources today creates long-term value and could save our customers an estimated $800 million to $1 billion in fuel costs over the next 20 years. We anticipate commission decisions on each of these proposals later this year. We also have RFPs outstanding to add thermal resources at both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo. We submitted bids in Minnesota and Colorado, and expect commission decisions this fall. We hope to update you on these proposed projects during our third quarter earnings call. Next, I'd like to comment on regulatory developments in Minnesota. Teresa will cover our pending 2013 rate case, but with large investments and our steam generator replacement at Prairie Island and the 2014 impact of the Monticello project, as well as other cost increases, we will need to file a sizable rate case later this year for 2014. We plan to pursue a multi-year regulatory plan in Minnesota. Recently, the Minnesota Commission issued an order for multi-year ratemaking, which could serve as a template for constructive regulation, providing revenue and regulatory certainty for both our customers and our shareholders. The framework includes the following guidelines: A multi-year rate plan must cover up to 3 years, with the first year representing a fully filed rate case; companies may recover specific capital costs and appropriate O&M costs in the second and third years; the ROE authorizing the rate case will be used for the entire multi-year period; and finally, companies will need to file for fixed rates over the period, with certain costs subject to refund. And the parties have filed for clarification on certain items in the multi-year order, and we expect the commission to issue a final order later this year. We believe a multi-year plan may allow us to obtain timely cost recovery of our capital expenditures while eliminating the need for multiple rate cases given the substantial investments we continue to make in Minnesota. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss second quarter results, provide you with an update on recent regulatory development, review our financing plans and update you on our 2013 earnings guidance. I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter results at each of our 4 operating companies. Earnings in NSP-Minnesota increased $0.03 per share, largely due to interim electric rates subject to refund in Minnesota and North Dakota, and a rate increase in South Dakota. In addition, higher natural gas margins due to cooler weather and lower interest expense also helped to improve profitability. Second quarter earnings at PSCo were flat. Higher electric and natural gas margins and lower interest charges were offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher electric and gas rates effective in January 2013, as well as the effect of higher natural gas margins due to the cooler weather. SPS earnings decreased $0.01 per share, as higher O&M expenses, depreciation and interest charges were partially offset by a rate increase in Texas that was effective in May 2013. I'll now discuss some of the key drivers of our consolidated earnings results, beginning with retail electric margin. Second quarter electric margin increased $26 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $56 million from new rate increases and interim rates subject to refunds in certain states. This amount includes the reserve for revenues subject to refund of approximately $31 million at NSP-Minnesota and $10 million from increased transmission revenue net of expenses. These positive drivers were partially offset by several smaller items, including a $9 million refund at PSCo as a result of estimated earnings test obligation, a $9 million reduction in conservation and DSM incentives and $8 million decrease in firm wholesale revenue and various other items. Second quarter weather normalized retail electric sales decreased 0.2%. As been noted, we experienced a series of storms in Minnesota in June that impacted over 600,000 customers. We estimated that the impact of these storms reduced our quarterly electric sales by about 22,000 megawatts or 0.1%. Second quarter natural gas margins increased $21 million, primarily as a result of a $12 million impact from cooler weather and a $7 million increase from higher retail sales growth. Based on year-to-date trends, we now forecast weather-adjusted firm natural gas sales to increase 2% in 2013. Previously, we forecasted a 1% decline. Turning to expenses. O&M increased 5.3%. The primary drivers of the increase were $12 million of other electric and gas distribution expenses, largely due to increased maintenance activities; $9 million related to higher nuclear plant costs associated with operational initiatives and other smaller items. Through the first 6 months of 2013, O&M expenses increased 4.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance. We continue to forecast an annual increase of 4% to 5%, but we will closely monitor our O&M levels to determine if we have to take actions to change spending levels, which will be dependent on circumstances in the second half of the year. Depreciation and amortization increased $17.3 million or 7.6% due to our ongoing investment in our systems. We continue to forecast D&A to increase approximately $75 million to $85 million. Other taxes increased $2.4 million or 2.4%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota, Colorado and Texas. As a result of updated forecast, we now expect our consolidated property taxes will increase between $20 million to $25 million, which is lower than we previously projected. I'll now provide an update on regulatory developments, beginning with our pending rate case in Minnesota. We will be in front of the Minnesota Commission next week, so we will keep our comments limited. In early July, the Minnesota ALJ issued a report and recommended a rate increase of approximately $127 million based in an ROE of 9.83%, an equity ratio of 52.56% and an electric rate base of $6.2 billion. The recommendation also included an estimated $51 million of deferrals related to Sherco 3, the Monticello upgrade and pension cost. We estimate these recommended deferrals would have a $34 million impact on our 2013 earnings. From a pretax earnings perspective, the recommendation is nearly $100 million lower than our most recent revenue requirement request of $259 million, including $50 million of proposed deferral mechanisms. We recently filed exceptions and clarifications to the ALJ report, which supported many of our initial positions. Specifically, we sought different outcomes on several items that affect the revenue requirement, including the sales forecast and ROE. Deliberations are scheduled for August 6 and 8. The MPUC is expected to vote on many of the key issues at their meeting on August 8 and issue an order in September 2013. In North Dakota, we are seeking a $16 million rate increase based on a 2013 forecast test year of 10.6% ROE, electric rate base of about $378 million and a 52.56% equity ratio. On July 17, the staff filed direct testimony recommending a rate decrease of $2 million, based largely on a change in cost allocations and ROE. While this is a disappointing recommendation, we are cautiously optimistic that we will ultimately reach a constructive outcome in North Dakota. In Wisconsin, we recently filed for an electric rate increase of $40 million and a natural gas rate increase of $4.7 million. The requests are based on an ROE of 10.4%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2014 forecasted electric rate base of $895 million and a natural gas rate base of $90 million. Staff and intervenor testimony is scheduled for October 4. We anticipate a final decision before year end, with the new rates effective in January 2014. At PSCo, we are seeking a $65 million multi-year gas rate increase covering 2013 to 2015, based on a 10.3% ROE, an equity ratio of 56% and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Rates, subject to refund, will go into effect on August 10. An ALJ recommendation is expected later this month, and a CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter. Finally, at SPS, in New Mexico, we are seeking a $43.3 million rate request based on a 2014 forecast test year and a 10.65% ROE, rate base of $480 million and an equity ratio of 53.9%. We anticipate a commission decision by year end, with the new rates going into effect during the first quarter of 2014. I'll now update you on the progress of our 2013 financing plans. During the second quarter, we continue to leverage our strong credit ratings and the low interest rate environment issuing $850 million of debt at favorable rates. At NSP-Minnesota, we issued $400 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds, with a coupon of 2.6%. At the holding company, we issued a $450 million 3-year note at just 75 basis points. The latter financing, combined with the equity proceeds from our first quarter ATM issuance, enabled us to call the $400 million 7 6/10% holding company junior subordinated note. Based on the successful execution of our financing plans, we now project a $40 million to $45 million decrease in interest expense during 2013. Looking ahead, we plan to issue $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS during the third quarter. Upon completion, the issuance of this SPS bond should wrap up our 2013 financing program. However, financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market condition and other factors. In closing, we delivered another successful quarter, both financially and operationally. We continue to expect to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $1.85 to $1.95 per share. This is based on strong year-to-date performance, lower interest expense and property taxes, a lower effective tax rate, constructive outcomes in all regulatory proceedings and a final decision in the Minnesota's 2013 electric rate case that is consistent with the ALJ recommendation. At our Analyst Meeting in December 2011, we discussed the potential for our EPS growth rate to moderate post-2013. This was based on lower rate base growth, sluggish sales and the potential for compression in authorized ROE. While we remain on track to deliver 2013 earnings consistent within our guidance range, we believe these factors, particularly the lower ROE recommendations we have received in several of our pending rate cases, will make it more challenging to achieve EPS at the upper end of our targeted 5% to 7% range beyond this year. We are positioned to continue delivering an attractive total return, should earnings growth taper as a result of these factors. With a payout ratio below 60%, we have the flexibility to grow our dividends at a faster rate than we have in the past. We plan to provide more clarity on our long-term EPS and dividend growth objectives later this year. This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, would you please provide instructions for the Q&A session?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So I guess I'm not going to -- I won't ask you to articulate your rationale on, sort of, tweaking of the total return expectation because you plan on giving us more meat on that later this year; is that fair?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Greg, if I could, first of all, let me just apologize to everybody on the call. We have significant construction going on outside, and I think that might have interfered with some of the broadcast. I don't know if you could hear it, Greg.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: It's way in the background. I think you're okay.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Okay. I think we're just reiterating what we've been saying all along, Greg, that after this year, it's likely that our growth rate will modulate a bit as our capital expenditures start to levelize off. And you look at where ROE's are going in the trend and it certainly says that we're probably correct in that, but more to come.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. You obviously have the ability to accelerate growth in the dividend payout ratio, given that it is way below industry average.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Absolutely. And as you and I have talked many times before, Greg, as we went through this construction mode, we wanted to be more conservative with our dividend for a number of reasons. And I think that gives us dry powder in a different -- maybe a unique way that we reward shareholders going forward.
Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And let me ask you a question with regard to the announcements you've made in the last few days over -- around procuring the 2,000 megawatts wind resources. If you should be successful in procuring the wind at the mix that you are proposing, which is the majority of it being PPAs, some being owned by your utility subs, is that also going to then require you to have to reassess and increase the amount of transmission spend in order to bring all that power to market? And so would that be an ancillary impact of getting that 2,000 megawatts into the portfolio?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: No, it really wouldn't. I mean, we're going to make use of transmission lines and capabilities that are already in place. I think the one issue that we have with the additional 150-megawatt project in North Dakota is making sure that the transmission will be available there at a reasonable cost. And -- but it won't drive any additional major capital expenditures on transmission, Greg.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: If you look at post-2013, are you still assuming that O&M growth rate decreases from 4% to 5% to the 3% to 4% O&M range? And what would have to happen for you to get to lower end of that O&M long-term growth rate?
Teresa S. Madden: Neil, this is Teresa. I mean, yes, we're definitely assuming that we will taper down, and we are working on several initiatives that involve productivity improvements, I mean, really across the company. And we do think we'll be able to execute on those that will tend to lower the trend in terms of the overall growth rate.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And can you talk to the timing of the next Minnesota rate case and the next Colorado electric case, when you expect them to be filed and when do you expect the rates to actually going to effect?
Teresa S. Madden: In terms of the next Minnesota rate case, we plan to file later this year for 2014, and we expect it to be a multi-year case. Now whether that will be a 2- or 3-year case, we have not developed all the details on that. In Colorado, as you know on the electric case, we're in a 3-year multi-year, which is '12, '13 and '14. So we would expect to file a case in Colorado for '15 around the middle of 2014.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And the last question, Teresa and Ben. We're seeing some strength in weather-normal natural gas sales across the U.S. This is the first time in a long time we've seen this. Is there something structural going on here? It certainly exceeded your forecast this year as well.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Let me chime in and then, Teresa, please add. But I think it's too early to tell. We certainly saw across our board, particularly in this last quarter, significant increase in gas usage. But weather has also been a little bit unusual, too. And sometimes that -- especially when it's up and down within a month, that can create some problems with our weather normalization models. But it's positive trend, and I hope it continues. But I think it's too early to tell. Teresa, you agree with that?
Teresa S. Madden: I totally agree with that. And I think these aberrations in the weather on a shoulder month, as you indicated, we need to watch that.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Travis Miller with MorningStar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could help me clarify one thing in the release Note 2, where you break down the electric margin. You show that $131 million for the first 6 months. I just want to make sure that excludes the $47 million that you've reserved related to Minnesota.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, it's net of it. Correct. It's net.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: So at what level does that $131 million suggest in Minnesota? Is that to the $209 million that you've recommended, or does that go down to, say, somewhere around the ALJ ruling, that you're actually recording in earnings?
Teresa S. Madden: I would say -- well, it is around the ALJ.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, okay, great. And then separate subject. When shall we start -- expect to start seeing any kind of financial impact from the Boulder situation, near term or long term?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, Travis, this is Ben. I think what you're seeing right now is some legal costs sort of thing. But as far as the overall impact, are you assuming should Boulder actually municipalize?
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: F Yes, I'd assume no impact, right, if status quo?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: First of all, you probably wouldn't see the impact of that for, I don't know, 3 to 5 years. And then as we've talked about before, it's -- in the big picture of Xcel Energy, it's not a large portion of our sales. And of course, we would aggressively defend customers outside of Boulder and our own shareholders and making sure we receive the reimbursement that we're entitled to, if they were to municipalize. So I don't think it's going to be a big impact.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glen Rock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just in terms of the [indiscernible] little bit of a flavor in terms of if you were to boost your payout, would you guys be thinking of doing it in sort of a growth over multiple years or sort of as a step function, just move it up depending, of course, what the growth outlook is? Do know what I'm saying, just philosophically? I mean I know the board decides it. But do you know what I'm sort of saying? I mean, in some cases, you see an actual, sort of, like, hey, we're going to change it here or it's sort of like, you know what, we're just going to accelerate the growth of the dividend.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes. Paul, at this point, I can't give you any more flavor to that than we've already said. And more to come on that as the year progresses, and we get more input into what our expenditures are going to be and all the other factors that you consider with the board to your point in making a dividend recommendation.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. In terms of the sales growth, the 0% to 0.5%, going down from 0.5%, is that weather adjusted, or is that just because of what you see in terms of the weather so far this year?
Teresa S. Madden: It's weather adjusted.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then in terms of -- you're mentioning these rate cases. I'm just sort of wondering, in terms of your sales growth forecast longer term, could you give us a flavor maybe just for at least Minnesota or Colorado sort of what the long-term growth forecast is? And with respect to Minnesota and the multi-year plan, is there a -- you mentioned O&M and other factors. But if the sales fluctuates, would that potentially also be adjusted under the multi-year plan that Minnesota is looking into here?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think, Paul, I think, there's a lot of more to come on that. I mean, as I've said in my remarks, the parties are seeking clarification. And even with clarification, I think that those are the kind of elements that become part of the discussion on how we would go forward. I mean, just as an FYI, sales in Minnesota are not very strong, and they're tracking pretty much to our expectations. We didn't expect it to be a strong year, and that's the way it's turning out. So whether or not there would be true-up mechanisms or you would just live with it remains to be seen in the 3-year plan. But...
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, I understand. It's early days. But just in general, how should we think about the sales growth, let's say -- I mean, as you mentioned, I mean, you guys have a big -- you guys have a wide geographical reach. What is sort of the look -- what is the sales growth longer term with everything that you know so far, obviously, versus Minnesota, versus Colorado, for instance, or your other jurisdictions?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I would say that Minnesota is probably the most sluggish and we're seeing the most declines. And then, I would say that Colorado is about flat, and we are seeing the strongest growth in actually SPS and NSP-Wisconsin.
Teresa S. Madden: I would agree with that. Over the next 5 years, maybe just as rule of thumb, our growth we're projecting to be at, consolidated, up to 1%. But Ben is actually -- he's very correct in terms of Minnesota, we're seeing the most erosion in sales.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just finally, obviously, we've got the situation in Boulder, but Minneapolis also seems to be looking into this. Is this just coincidence that these guys are -- or is there any sort of trend here in terms of municipalization? Could you just give us a little bit of a flavor as to -- this is a sort of local politics sort of situation or is there something else going on?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think each city is unique, but we do live in communities that very much want to advance their Clean Energy agenda. As you know, Paul, we're very much advanced in the Clean Energy agenda, but we're doing so with economics and price point in mind. There's actually, today, a public hearing on the municipalization discussion in Minneapolis. And they will -- there'll be a vote, I believe, on August 16, by the Council as to whether or not to put this out for public vote in November. The issue is that the city has a climate action plan. We're actually ahead of many of the goals that the climate action plan calls for. We'll have a 30% carbon reduction in the upper Midwest by 2020. So we're just going -- I think at the end of the day, we're going to sit down, work with the city. And I think everybody recognizes the cost and risks and -- the enormous cost for Minneapolis to go forward with something like that. So it is an election year. It has been an issue that's been brought to the attention, and it's gotten a lot of media play. And we look forward to working with the communities, the cities, the stakeholder groups. And we've been a partner for 100 years; I suspect we'll be a partner in Minneapolis for another 100 years. In terms of Boulder, that's farther along. And while I think the -- I don't think it would benefit the customers, we will find out more. The city had a -- the first readout on this in July, wasn't it, Teresa?
Teresa S. Madden: Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: And there'll be another vote on that also in August, whether or not they proceed with condonation proceedings. Again, that's a long process. There'll be another vote in November on debt [indiscernible] to how much all this would cost, and I think there still continues to be work on how we could work with this city and avoid municipalization. But it is what it is, and -- but stepping back to answer your question on a more macro level, we're going to -- I think it's important in this world that we continue to offer more choice to citizens, communities, cities, and we're going to continue to do that. Look for us to do more of that. But also look for us to do that in a way that's fair to people -- to all citizens, all communities and all cities. And that's a really important principle. And so sometimes, I'm talking maybe too much here, Paul, but sometimes we're the middle-of-the-road kind of people where we try to do things that are reasonable and smart, and sometimes you get hit by traffic on both sides of the road when you do that. But I think it's the right way to go for our customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan: Can you just -- you started off in your remarks regarding the wind and then just going to the conversation regarding people wanting to see more renewables. My first question is, utilities all around are now buying either solar or wind for tax purposes and other stuff. That's also another new thing, which, of course, you can't utilize, I guess, for the reasons. But why bid out these PPAs? Why not build ourself, because that is what the constituents and everyone wants? Why give this capital away to someone else who would utilize our balance sheet and credit ratings? Why not, Ben, be more aggressive in being this wholly owned and for our own self, for our own shareholders, rather than bidding it out? That's question #1. Question #2 is what you mentioned on the Slide 2, is this incorporated? You are mentioning even in North Dakota some wind plant. Is this all incorporated in the 5-year CapEx, I guess, which I have from the beginning of the year? Is that incorporated in the CapEx numbers or not? 2 different questions.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: To answer your second question, it's not.
Teresa S. Madden: That's correct.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: So that would be incremental capital spend. To answer your first question, which is far more complicated, obviously. Obviously, we have a process that we need to go through, Ashar. And we need to justify what is the right decision for our customers to our commissions, as we should. We like to build more, but you have to recognize that -- not unlike when you make a decision to buy a car. If you're going to hold that car for a long time, almost always it's a better decision to build. But as you know, your initial monthly payments would be higher and ownership versus a lease. So we're trying to seek a blend that allows for ownership, which we do think over the long term has a better long-term value for our customers, but also blend it in with PPAs that have that levelized cost. And I think we're seeking the right balance there. And I suppose we could be more aggressive, but I will tell you, the important thing in my mind is that we get these deals done and our customers save $1 billion of fuel over the next 20 years. And while we might not get the direct benefit of that, I think benefiting our customers will always come back to benefit us.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And then how much -- can you just elaborate if you are successful to what you said this morning, how much of additional CapEx is that, please?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Do you want to take that, Teresa?
Teresa S. Madden: Sure. Well, in terms of this, if we just have one, we could be around the $350 million; at 2 would be potentially closer to $600 million.
Ashar Khan: And that would be in the next 2 years, Teresa, is that the right frame, 2014, '15?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, minimal spend this year. Most of it is in '15.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Ashar, that's also based on just kind of taking an average dollar per kilowatt times the 200 megawatts. That's an estimate. It's not necessarily indicative of the actual price.
Teresa S. Madden: Right.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And then, if I can just conceptually understand the Minnesota case. When is a decision on the multi-year plan? Ben, you mentioned you're going to have a decision later this year; what is the timeframe of that? Is that September, October or something like that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, they already came out and stepped the framework for a multi-year plan, Ashar. The additional clarifications will be later this year. I don't think there's any set timeframe. But we anticipate we'll get that clarification prior to filing of 2014 rate case, which would include a multi-year proposal.
Ashar Khan: Okay. So if I look -- as you mentioned in your 8-K earlier and today also, weather and all those things helped us to be able to be within the guidance range, assuming the Minnesota PUC rules next weeks or so in line with the ALJ. So am I correct then for next year, we will probably have interim rates in effect starting beginning of the year or so. The impact of any -- whatever the commission's decision is really doesn't have a follow-through effect going forward next year, because the interim rates should be effect from the beginning of the year, and we should be able to be asking for what they didn't give us this time into that next filing; is that a clear way to think of it?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I would say it's partially correct. The -- there's a -- first of all, we have to file for interim rates and we would -- we have been receiving interim rates. But there's some limitations on what you can base your interim rate request on, Ashar. So -- and I've got Teresa and Scott here. I think it could have some impact. But the concept that you speak to is generally correct. So to the extent, as we've mentioned, that we have deferral mechanisms, those deferral mechanisms this year will fall right into '14 and would be part of our overall rate request in 2014.
Teresa S. Madden: It could. And if, for example, the commission's order is different than the ALJ, that could also affect the change in terms of the level of what we're requesting in '14.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And then, if I can end up...
Paul A. Johnson: Ashar, we've got several other people on the lines, I think we're going to have to move on. And if you want other questions, go back and we'll get you at the end.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. I did just want to hear a little bit about what you all are seeing in terms of economics for wind projects these days and as you look out sort of in the latest data points that you're seeing. And as you think about the PTC extension versus not being extended, how that would factor in to the volumes, to the outlook for wind growth?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I think it's -- I can't speak to whether or not it's sustainable, but we're seeing phenomenal pricing on wind, Stephen. And enough so that when we price of these things out, you can just make these things work economically on a fuel basis. So today, we could not lock into a 20-year strip of natural gas, with an assumed heat rate for less than we can lock in on wind projects for 20 years. So we're talking about prices, depending on the jurisdiction, in that $25 to $35 kind of megawatt per hour range. That's phenomenal. And of course, if I were to lock in a 20-year strip with natural gas, I wouldn't get any of the capacity value. And while we don't plan for wind because I have a big capacity value, so the economics aren't really based on its capacity. I can tell you what our analysis is showing is that in some of the peakiest, warmest summer days, the wind is blowing. And so we are getting capacity value out of it. So this is just, in my opinion, a home run for our customers. And we're happy to do it. And I think the other thing we've got going for us is that we were in a position where we didn't have to take any of these bids. So we were not a price taker; we could be a price maker. And again, that'll benefit our customers. And I think in the long run, anything that benefits our customersbenefits shareholders, provided it's not a little over ROE.
Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Understood, understood. And maybe just conceptually on ROEs more broadly, as we think about your ROE position now and the timing of your rate case, I guess, at a big picture, sort of thinking about the movements in interest rates since the last -- in the last several months. And as you look at the ROEs here and you look at them the way that the jurisdictions are calculating ROEs, is this sort of -- should we think of this potentially as a trough in the sense that rates have been increasing since then, mechanically, would -- the timing would appear to have been a trough relative to where we are today as you look out at where interest rates are headed? Or is that not a fair characterization?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I think interest rates rising could -- would be supportive of your trough issue. There's other factors that go into that. But I think -- as you probably know, I think there's a notional amount of return that investors want as well. So again, Teresa or Scott, if you want to comment on that?
Teresa S. Madden: No, I mean, I agree with the premise as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: A couple of quick questions. Ben, one is in the earnings release, when you talk about keeping to your guidance, you talk about the favorable weather, and then you talk about certain other items as well. Can you just remind us what are those certain other items, and what favorable impact they are giving you?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: How about if I turn that over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, Ali, if you look at the, actually, the specific earnings guidance items, a number of them we have changed that are favorable. And the key ones are property taxes, AFUDC equity, interest expense and the lower effective tax rate. So a combination of all of those are the certain other items.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I got it. Okay. And then also in Minnesota, you're going through this big rate case right now and, right on the heels of that, the multi-year rate case is coming. And can you talk a little bit about the sensitivity in terms of the timing of one big case ending and the next one starting? And we heard some ramblings from the commission that they're not too happy with that. Just wanted to get your perspective.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: We certainly understand that concern and that criticism, and it's -- there's a lot of things coming at once. Our nuclear investment for the next 20 years is a big part of that. But there's a whole host of things that we are investing in to make sure that we are prepared for the future and have a resilient distribution system, have the right amount of transmission. So there's a lot coming. I do think it starts to levelize off. So I think that dialogue, hopefully, we can have, is how we can make sure that we get adequate recovery of those investments but also be responsive to the pace of the regulatory filings that we're making. So more to come on that. We understand the issue. We understand that everybody wants this capital we spend, and we have to work with stakeholders, the commission, their staff, to figure out the best way forward. I think a multi-year framework is a good place to start with that. That gives us an opportunity to, I think, do some longer-range planning.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And last question, as we look at the results so far, perhaps either on an LTM basis or based in the '13 guidance, can you remind us in which jurisdiction are you seeing the biggest regulatory lag right now?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: It would be at our SPS jurisdictions, where we don't have forward test years.
Teresa S. Madden: Exactly.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: South Dakota.
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, it's wherever we have a historical test year. SPS, we're doing -- Texas, we're doing better but it's still the biggest lag, continues to be.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And the best performing from a lag perspective or lack of lag perspective would be?
Teresa S. Madden: Colorado, Colorado Electric.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I mean, Ali, one of the things you'll notice is we had an earnings test in Colorado, and we had a refund back to customers, which tells you that we're slightly earning above our authorized return in 2013 for Colorado.
Teresa S. Madden: In '12.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: '12. Excuse me, I meant in '12.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I guess, my first question has to do with the 5% to 7% growth rate. For what period of -- or out to what period of time does that 5% to 7% apply?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, as I tried to indicate, at least, in my comments that clearly, it's applying to '13. We expect that to continue. After we get past '13, because of all the factors like pressure on ROEs, we could see that moderating down some. But more to come because we're in the middle of rate cases right now, and there's several other factors.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So when you were talking about being in the low end of that range, that would only apply to '13 then?
Teresa S. Madden: We said -- I talked about after '13, not being able to achieve the high end of the 5% to 7%.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. Second question would be, what is the PSIA portion of the increase request that you have in Colorado? So in other words, if you just strip out the PSIA piece for '13, how much is that?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, it's $26 million, $27 million.
Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last question for me is, what's driving the increase in AFUDC relative to your guidance? Is it that you're accelerating the amount of your investment? Or is the AFUDC rate higher than what you were assuming?
Teresa S. Madden: It really has to do -- it's the construction timing and the amount of it. It's the combination of those and how much short-term debt we have outstanding. In terms of less short-term debt, it tends to drive up the AFUDC rate, the equity rate. And so that -- those are the biggest drivers.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment.
Dan Jenkins: I just had a couple of questions related to this Minnesota multi-year plan. So is it -- I guess, I'm wondering, a lot of other states, they've had to pass legislation to implement this type of thing. Is there -- is the current utility legislation fully compliant with implementing the multi-year plan or get some parties...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: No, we've already had that pass through the legislative process.
Teresa S. Madden: And the commission is just buying...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: So the mechanics were -- for the commission to determine, and that's what the -- it did earlier this year, they just established the framework.
Dan Jenkins: So -- and then, do you expect this to be in place, then, prior to your 2014 case, you said; is that correct?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: The framework is in place, so -- I mean, it is in place. And as you go through this the first time, there's always going to be questions about the mechanics and some of the more detailed rule -- rulings within. And that's the process we're in right now.
Dan Jenkins: So do you see it working similar to how they do it in Wisconsin or can you give us a little more...
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Wisconsin is by statue, is you file it every 2 years. So this, I think, would be a little bit different in that you can have a longer period of time, there's different rules. And you've got capital and some O&M costs that you can recover in potentially the second and third years.
Teresa S. Madden: Right. If you file that all initially in Minnesota, where Wisconsin you come in every other year, but you have to reopen her.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Right.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan: Yes, I guess, it's a timing question. Ben, you guys have always given us, like, the next year's guidance on the third quarter call. So is it fair that we should get this new growth rate and guidance on the third quarter call?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, I mean, we'll have a number of opportunities. We've done it in the third quarter. I think we've done it at EEI. We've done it at different times. But we will definitely keep you updated as this thing develops.
Operator: And I am showing no further questions. I will turn the call back to Ms. Teresa. Please go ahead.
Teresa S. Madden: We appreciate your participation in our second quarter earnings call. Please call Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions. And thanks.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the second quarter 2013 earnings conference call.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Paul A. Johnson - Vice President of Investor Relations & Financial Management Benjamin G. S. Fowke - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President Teresa S. Madden - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Andrew Levi
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2013 first quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our first quarter results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2013 guidance. There are slides that accompany today's call which are available on our web page. We will also post a brief video of Teresa summarizing our financial results on the website. As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thanks, Paul, and good morning. Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $0.48 per share compared with $0.38 per share in 2012. First quarter results reflect colder than normal weather, increased electric and gas margins from various rate cases and lower interest expense. Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments. Our first quarter results are a good start to 2013. However, there are challenges ahead. I'll now provide you with a few updates beginning with a review of some key regulatory developments. As you know, it is important to receive timely constructive recovery of the substantial investments we make in our utility business. That said, we were disappointed with the surrebuttal testimony filed by various parties in our Minnesota electric rate case. While we understand this case has some unique circumstances, for example, around our Serco Plant, we thought we provide a good support for our cause, as well as rate making alternatives that balance the interest of various parties. Clearly, the recommended level of recovery is not commensurate with over $5 billion of investment that is planned over the next 5 years. We will work with parties to narrow issues where we can and we will ask the commission to resolve our differences in a way that allows us to continue providing high-quality service to our customers over the long run. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can achieve a constructive outcome in this case. Our earnings guidance assumes constructive outcomes in all rate case and regulatory proceedings. We do not consider the current recommendations from the interveners to be constructive. And should the commission approves a rate increase at these levels, our ability to deliver earnings within our 2013 guidance range would be much more challenging. Looking ahead, initial briefs are due May 15, the ALJ Report is due July 3, and we continue to anticipate a Minnesota PUC decision in September. We also received disappointing recommendations from interveners in our proposed multiyear natural gas rate case in Colorado. Notably, the staff recommended a rate reduction of $14.4 million based on a historic test year, an ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 52%. The office of consumer council recommended a rate increase of $0.5 million based on a historic test year and ROE of 9% and an equity ratio of 51%. Earlier this week, we filed rebuttal testimony and reduced our requested increase from $70 million to $65 million over 3 years which largely reflects lower than requested ROE to 10.3%. This initial wide range between the bid and ask on this case is not unusual in Colorado. We continue to work towards a constructive outcome either through settlement or through the normal proceedings. Looking ahead, the case will be heard by the ALJ later this month. On a positive note, I'm pleased that we've already reached settlements in our Texas and South Dakota rate cases. In Texas, our settlement agreement, which is pending commission approval calls for a $37 million annual increase effective in May and a step increase of approximately $14 million in September of this year. It also allows us to implement interim rates for our next transmission cost recovery rider in January of 2014 accelerating recovery by several months. Every settlement is a compromise and this one's no different. While the agreed-upon rate increase falls short of our requested amount, we believe we're making continued progress in Texas. In addition to the interim rates agreed on, one of the other positives of this settlement is that both sides are very interested in achieving constructive rate making outcomes and are interested in discussing alternatives such as a multiyear rate plan prior to our next filing. The commission will act on the settlement later this year. In South Dakota, we had requested a $19.4 million electric rate increase. In April, the commission approved the settlement agreement which we reached with staff. New rates include an $11.6 million base rate increase plus the implementation of a new rider to recover an additional $3.7 million that began on May 1. Similar to Texas, this settlement is a compromise, which represents a step in the right direction to improving earn return in the north -- rather South Dakota. However, we are making -- while we're making progress, however, we're not earning an acceptable return in South Dakota and need to continue to take steps to improve this jurisdiction's returns. We will continue to work with regulators then legislators to improve the earned ROE. Turning to our resource plans, we recently issued RFP in both Minnesota and Colorado. In Minnesota, we're seeking potential additions of up to 200 megawatts of wind generation. This could be in the form of a PPA or an ownership option. Since we are ahead of the renewable portfolio standard in Minnesota, we will only add incremental wind generation if it is at an attractive price point for our customers. There's also an RFP for 500 megawatts of thermal generation in Minnesota, which could also either be a PPA or a self build option introduced later in May and Part of this RFP, we have proposed to build up the 3 combustion turbines to meet our customer needs. We have requested that these investments include wider recovery with a sharing mechanism. Other independent parties have also did projects instead of process. Regulators in Minnesota and North Dakota will review our proposal and proposals from other party to determine which offering presents the best deal for customers. We expect a decision later this year. In Colorado, we also have an RFP for 250 megawatts of generation, which could also either be a PPA or self build option. Introduced later in May and we expect a commission decision later this year. It remains to be seen whether and ownership bid will be the best option for our customers. However, it is important to note that an ownership option would be incremental to our capital forecast. Let me touch on a few other highlights of the quarter. Once again, Xcel Energy was recognized as the #1 Wind Provider by WEA. This is our ninth year in which we have earned this distinction. This underscores our proactive approach to environmental leadership. In Texas, we are nearing completion of the Jones 4 combustion turbine. This additional capacity is needed to meet growth at SPS. This project is coming in on time and under budget. We also continue to make good progress in our transmission investments. One of our key projects is the CapEx 2020 plan. Since February, Xcel Energy and 4 other utilities started construction on the estimated 500 million, 150-mile Hampton Rochester Lacrosse 345 KB project. This line will enhance system reliability and allow for future growth and economic development. At SPS, the final segment of the Texas North transmission portfolio projects was placed into service in March. Work began in 2008 on this $150 million multiproject portfolio to service new load into Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle areas. This project also maintain area service reliability and meet our compliance. Also at SPS, I think it's important to highlight our transmission construction and renewal efforts paid off during the Texas Panhandle blizzard. In February, a portion of our service territory, the stretch from west of Lobbock to Farrington received over 2 feet of snow and experienced 65 to 75 mile per hour winds. During the storm, we experienced only 2 momentary outages and no sustained outages on our transmission system. Over the past 5 years, we've replaced 5200 cross arms, 820 poles the area covered by the blizzard and we rebuilt 100 miles of transmission lines. These efforts were credited for our system resiliency during the blizzard. I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our transmission employees for jobs well done. Our storm restoration capabilities were put through another test earlier this month in South Dakota. On April 9, the worst ice storm in decades hit Southeastern South Dakota. Sioux Falls, a city of 150,000 in County was especially hard hit but almost 90,000 outages. By April 11, we had more than tenfold increase over normal staff in place to complete the restoration. Shortly thereafter, Xcel Energy was recognized by the county for the extraordinary efforts of its employees to restore power and in keeping citizens safe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss first quarter results, our 2013 financing plan and our 2013 earnings guidance. I'll begin with a review of first quarter results. As you might recall, last year, we experienced a very warm first quarter which reduced our earnings by about $0.05 per share. This year we experienced slightly colder than normal temperatures across most of our service territory. As a result, first quarter earnings benefited from a $0.06 per share improvement in weather. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo increased by $0.05 per share, primarily due to the multiyear electric rate increase, as well as higher electric and gas sales due to cooler winter weather. At NSP in Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.05 per share due to interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota and an electric rate increase in South Dakota. Orders and results also benefited from cooler weather and lower interest charges as a result of a 2012 debt refinancing. Earnings at NSP Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to new electric and gas rates implemented in Colorado -- or in January and cooler weather. Earnings at SPS were flat for the quarter. Let's now take a look at the drivers that affected various lines at the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin increased $94 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were: $75 million from retail rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin and South Dakota as well as interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota and $22 million from cooler weather. These positive items were partially offset by smaller negative factors including the 2012 leap day impact. Weather normalized retail electric sales decreased 0.6%. However, the comparable period a year ago included the benefit of an extra day of sales due to the leap day. Adjusting for leap day, weather normalized retail electric sales increased 0.5%, which is consistent with our 2013 forecast. Higher electric sales were driven by 1.3% increases in both PSCo and SPS, partially offset by 0.5% sales decline in Minnesota. Natural gas margins increased $28 million in the first quarter, primarily due to cooler weather. Turning to expenses, first quarter O&M expense increased $18.5 million or 3.6%. The primary drivers of this increase were higher employee benefit costs, nuclear outage amortization and nuclear plant operation costs. We continue to forecast that our 2013 expenses will increase in the 4% to 5% range for the year. Depreciation and amortization increased $20 million or 8.8% with normal system expansion and additional rate case. Other taxes increased approximately $7.8 million or 7.4%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. This is a significant driver in our Minnesota electric rate case as approximately $40 million of our rate requested to cover -- recover higher property taxes. Higher property taxes in Colorado related to our electric Retail businesses are -- as part of the multiyear settlement approved by the Colorado Commission in 2012. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 33.4% compared to 29.1% during the comparable period a year ago. Recall that last year, we recognized a discrete tax benefit during the first quarter which lowered our overall effective rate for that period. For the year, we continue to forecast our 2013 effective tax rate will be in the range from 34% to 36%. During the first quarter, we completed 2 financings. In March we issued $500 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo and 2 tranches of $250 million each, a 10 year tranche with price at 2.5% and a 30-year tranche was at 3.95%. Also in March, we announced an At-The-Market or ATM equity program of up to $400 million. During March, we sold 7.7 million shares of common stock resulting in a net proceed of $223 million. As you recall, our 5-year CapEx forecast requires $400 million of external equity financing. Completing a portion of our planned equity financing in March allowed us to call the $400 million of 7.6% junior subordinated notes or hybrid security that we issued in 2008. This transaction lowers our overall cost of capital and simplifies our capital structure. Financing plans for the remainder of 2013 include plans to issue $400 million of First Mortgage Bonds at Minnesota and $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS. In addition, we also plan to issue $400 million of unsecured debt at the holding company during the second quarter. The financing plans are subject to change based on a variety of factors, including changes of our capital investment plan and financial market condition. Before we take your questions, I'll comment on our 2013 earnings guidance. This first quarter results, finally financing and resolution several rate cases have positioned us well to once again meet our annual financial objectives. So while we continue to forecast 2013 EPS to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95, we highlight the importance of meeting constructive outcomes in our pending rate cases in order to meet this objective. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Your O&M came in at 3.6%, as you said, versus the 4% to 5% guidance. Are you tracking at the lower end or even below this guidance for this year? And how should we think about O&M growth rates after 2013?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I mean, we are still anticipating to be in the 4% to 5%. We just have some timing that's why we're a little bit lower. But when we look to the longer term, I would say we would look to may be more a 3% to 4%. In product test, 4% to 5% is occurring because we only increased from '11 to '12, 1.7%. So '12 is a little bit low because it's part of our management initiatives and other things so I would look in the long term, the more 3% to 4% and on track to 4% to 5%.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then on interest you mentioned the remarkably low interest rates that you've done from debt out here in the first quarter. Given the low interest environment, could there be upside to the $30 million of interest reductions that you outlined for 2013?
Teresa S. Madden: That's consistent with that. We even assume the lower one.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And can you provide a little more color on the RFPs? Can you confirm that self build options are available for you for both of them? And any color in terms of the number of bidders if that information is in the public.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Neil, this is Ben. Self build options are available for both. We've seen I think some, I would say wide variety of bidders and opportunities and really just in the preliminary stages of evaluating both the wind and the fossil bids.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, but we don't know the exact numbers out there yet?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: No. We're not disclosing that at this point.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could characterize, in Minnesota, I wonder if you could characterize a change in the interveners testimony especially on the ROE from 10.2% to 9.8%, what were some of the drivers there and how does that relate to potentially changing your requested ROE?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, Travis, let me take the first part of your question. And I think that was around ROE. I think that's just typically they do update their ROE recommendation and analysis. And they looked -- it's a formulaic approach and frankly, the whole industry has seen some pretty significant stock appreciation in the last 4 months and when you run that through some of the models that does yield a lower ROE and that's was we saw there, it's very formulaic. And did you have a second part to your question?
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I was just going to say would that effect, you changing your 10.6% to a lower number.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: We filed our surrebuttal testimony and I guess we're just where we are now in the group. I don't know if you want to...
Teresa S. Madden: That's correct. We've left it at the same level so we have not revised our request at this point -- our requested 10.6%.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Typically, Travis, typically the recommendation on ROE plays a very -- is listened to very closely by the commission.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Real quick housekeeping. You mentioned that you recognize a liability for that change, the difference when you're expected and interim -- can you just give me what that number was?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I'll let Teresa take that.
Teresa S. Madden: I think, I would just say, we're assuming that we're going to have a reasonable regulatory outcome and we went through and looked at all the positions as we do in terms of establishing our guidance and we recognize that amount that we thought was reasonable.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: What was that amount?
Teresa S. Madden: We're not going to give you the specific amount but we would assume it's a reasonable outcome.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Travis, I mean, we typically -- I mean, we actually did it a little bit earlier than we normally would where we would recognize any kind of refund based upon where we are. But given where we are, it's -- what we're assuming in the accrual that, we're not going to disclose a number, but that -- we're not, it's going to be less than our interim rates but still what we would consider a constructive level so hopefully that helps you frame it a bit.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.
Andrew Levi: Actually, Travis asked my question. I guess, the only other question I have -- so just on the equity, so you did, was it, $227 million?
Teresa S. Madden: We had a net proceeds of $223 million.
Andrew Levi: $223 million, excuse me, I apologize. Okay, so you're more than halfway there I guess.
Teresa S. Madden: Right.
Andrew Levi: Equity. And that would take you through what year absent any new projects once you do the $400 million?
Teresa S. Madden: We have previously indicated that we had intended to do $400 million between '13 and '14.
Andrew Levi: Okay. And that would take you through what year once you get that $400 million done? Through '14 or through '15?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, and it's for the next 5 years. We don't have any...
Andrew Levi: Next 5 years, right okay. Unless, of course, I guess if you have some of these new projects, that could change?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, that's correct. We would reevaluate that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Teresa Madden for closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden: I want to thank you all for participating in our First Quarter Earnings Call this morning. I look forward to meeting with many of you at AGA and at the Deutsche Bank conference in the coming weeks. So please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team with any follow-up questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, January 31, 2013. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2012 Year-end Earnings Release Conference Call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning, we will review our 2012 results, update you on recent business and regulatory developments and reiterate our 2013 earnings guidance. There are slides that accompany today's call available on our Web page. In addition, later today, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results. As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2012 GAAP earnings of $1.85 per share reflect a $0.03 per share positive impact of the restoration of tax benefits expense in 2010 associated with federal subsidies for prescription drug plans. This benefit is not included in ongoing earnings, which is consistent with our treatment in 2010. Management believes ongoing earnings provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, comments this morning will focus on ongoing earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report 2012 ongoing earnings of $1.82 per share compared to $1.72 per share in 2011. This represents a 6% increase, consistent with our long-term objective of growing EPS 5% to 7%. It also marks the eighth consecutive year in which we have met or exceeded our earnings guidance and the third consecutive year in which we've delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In addition to strong earnings growth, we raised our dividend $0.04 or nearly 4%, consistent with our long-term commitment to increase the dividend 2% to 4% annually. The financial results are particularly satisfying, considering some of the headwinds we faced in the beginning of 2012. But our financial results are only one part of many successes we had in 2012. Notably, we continue to make significant investments to refresh aging infrastructure and improve reliability. Key projects remain on track and on budget. For example, in Texas, construction of the Jones 4 unit is now 85% complete, and we continue to target a May 2013 in-service date. In Colorado, we continue to make progress on the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act project. Also in 2012, we continued our transmission build-out, investing over $700 million in a variety of projects throughout our service territories. All 4 initial CapX2020 projects have received state regulatory approval and are now in the construction phase. In addition, the entire Bemidji-Grand Rapids 230 kV line is now fully energized. Looking ahead, we plan to invest over $1 billion in 2013 transmission projects. To finance these initiatives, we took advantage of historically low interest rates, issuing $1.8 billion in first mortgage bonds in 2012. Our credit quality remains high, and there's strong demand for our bonds. More specifically, at NSP-Minnesota, we issued a $300 million 10-year bond priced at a 2.15% coupon, and a $500 million 30-year bond priced at a 3.4% coupon. Both of these represented record low utility coupons for their respective tenors. The $800 million of PSCo bonds were issued at slightly higher rates, but still among the lowest for the utility sector. Locking in these low rates will provide benefits to our customers for years to come. Our customers also benefited from continued high levels of reliability. As you recall, the mild winter gave way to a hot and stormy summer season. I'm proud to say that our system held up extraordinarily well, and our reliability scores were among the best in the nation. Good reliability underscores how our strategy of prudently investing in our systems results in excellent service, even when faced with extreme weather cycles and events. Our customers appreciate excellent service, as our consistently high satisfaction scores indicate. And 2012 was a big year with several rate cases completed and filed. Of note, we implemented a multi-year plan in Colorado and reached constructive outcomes in several other cases. Finally, I'm really proud of how we achieved these results. We improved employee safety by almost 20%, making 2012 our best year ever. In summary, I couldn't have asked for a better first full year as Chairman and CEO. We certainly plan to build on these successes and add to our solid track record of performance in 2013 and beyond. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today, I will discuss year-end results, provide an update on our regulatory proceedings, review our 2013 financing plan and reiterate our 2013 earnings guidance. Let's begin a review of 2012 results at each of our 4 operating companies. 2012 earnings at PSCo increased $0.08 per share, primarily due to the multi-year electric rate plan implemented in May and warmer summer weather. Earnings at NSP-Minnesota decreased $0.03 per share due to warmer than normal winter weather, lower weather-normalized electric sales, as well as higher property taxes, O&M and depreciation expenses. SPS earnings increased $0.04 per share as a result of rate increases implemented in both New Mexico and Texas in January 2012. Finally, earnings at NSP-Wisconsin were flat. While we had some ups and downs by company, the consolidated results clearly emphasize the benefits of diversification. Now I'll review some of the key items that affected the consolidated income statement beginning with electric margin. For the year, electric margin increased $118 million, driven primarily by $125 million of rate increases across all 8 states. Other positive factors included increased demand and transmission revenue. In addition, conservation and DSM incentives also helped to improve retail electric margin. Overall, weather was not a driver of the increase in electric margin. While summer weather was warmer than normal in 2012, we also experienced a hot summer in 2011. These positive drivers were partially offset by a $48 million decrease related to the expiration of a long-term power sale agreement with Black Hills Corporation, effective at the beginning of 2012. While it varies by jurisdiction, weather-normalized consolidated electric sales were flat for the year. However, when eliminating the impact of Leap Day in 2012, sales declined by 0.3%. We believe that sluggish sales were driven by a combination of the economy, conservation efforts and improvements in appliance, efficiency and saturation. In addition, we lost a couple of large customers in Minnesota, which reduced our sale by about 0.5%. Natural gas margins increased $8 million for the year, reflecting the implementation of the pipeline system integrity rider in Colorado, as well as new rates in Colorado and Wisconsin. These positive factors were primarily offset by the negative impact of weather and a decrease in conservation and DSM revenue. Due to the record warm winter experienced across much of our service territory, firm natural gas sales decreased 11%, reducing consolidated EPS by approximately $0.035 when compared to 2011. On a weather-normalized basis, sales declined by about 1%. Turning to expenses. O&M increased $36 million or 1.7% for the year. Virtually the entire annual O&M increase occurred during the fourth quarter. Primary drivers of the increase were employee benefits, including pension costs; the pipeline system integrity costs, partially offset by lower plant generation costs, lower bad debt expense and other smaller items. After implementing cost management initiatives at the beginning of the year to offset warmer than normal winter weather and other headwinds, we held O&M flat for the first 3 quarters of the year. However, after experiencing a very hot summer, we took advantage of this favorable situation, investing more in our operating infrastructure to help maintain high levels of reliability going forward. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a $10 million charge related to the Minnesota Commission's approval to terminate the Prairie Island upgrade project as well as an $11 million charge associated with the recent ALJ recommendation to disallow the recovery of certain costs of our smart grid city project in Colorado. Because we pursued the Prairie Island upgrade project under the terms of an approved certificate of need and the investment did yield tangible and significant benefits for these customers, we plan to seek recovery of our full investment including return on these costs in our 2014 rate case. Looking ahead, we anticipate that higher nuclear, health care, chemical and other costs will drive a 2013 O&M increase of approximately 4% to 5% over 2012. Longer term, we forecast O&M to grow 3% to 4% annually. One additional year-end variance of note was within other taxes, which increased $34 million or 9.1%, largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. I'll now provide an update on a few of our regulatory proceedings touching on certain key items. Significant details related to our rate cases can be found in today's press release. Late last year, we filed several cases, which will impact both 2013 and 2014. These rate cases reflect the continued investment in our utilities. Primary drivers of such investments are to replace aging infrastructure to ensure excellent reliability. These investments are expected to provide outstanding value to our customers and create jobs in our community. In December, we reached constructive outcomes in our Wisconsin electric and gas cases, with new rates becoming effective earlier this month. In the electric case, the Commission approved a $35.5 million increase compared to our $39.1 million request. In the natural gas case, the Commission approved a $2.7 million increase compared to our $5.3 million request. As part of this approval, we will begin cost recovery for the Ashland environmental remediation, which for the first time includes a return on the unamortized balance. This was done to offset the longer amortization time period, which will minimize the customer impact. In South Dakota, we implemented interim rates in January, subject to refunds, while we continued to work with the staff to reach a settlement in the ongoing rate case. In November, in Minnesota, we filed a $285 million electric rate increase request based on a 2013 test year, and a 10.6% ROE and a 52.56% equity ratio. An interim increase of $251 million was approved and implemented on January 1. The procedural schedule for this case has been established. Key dates include Intervenor's testimony on February 28, rebuttal testimony on March 25, evidentiary hearings beginning April 18 and an ALJ report on July 3. We anticipate a Commission decision this fall. We also filed several other cases during the fourth quarter of 2012, which include a $90 million electric rate request in Texas, which is based on an ROE of 10.65%. We anticipate a decision this summer with final rates effective by midyear. In Colorado, we filed a $70 million multi-year natural gas rate case based on a forward test year and a 10.5% ROE. This request includes a $48.5 million increase in 2013 with step increases of $9.9 million in 2014 and $12.1 million in 2015. As part of the Colorado natural gas case, we also requested an extension and expansion of the pipeline integrity rider. In addition, we requested a $5 million increase in steam rates over the next 3 years. We anticipate a Commission decision on these requests later this year, with final rates expected to be effective in the third quarter. In North Dakota, we filed an electric case seeking a $17 million increase based on a forecast test year and a 10.6% ROE. Interim rates, subject to refunds, have been approved by the Commission and will go into effect in mid-February. We anticipate a Commission decision in the third quarter, with final rates effective in the fourth quarter. Finally, in New Mexico, we filed an electric case seeking a $46 million increase based on a forecast test year and a 10.65% ROE. We anticipate a Commission decision later this year, with final rates effective in 2014. We remain confident that while each request will receive scrutiny, the requests are well-grounded, driven primarily by necessary capital investments. And as a result, we will ultimately add to our track record of constructive outcomes. Turning to capital expenditures. We've updated our 5-year forecast to reflect the termination of the Prairie Island uprate project. We now anticipate spending approximately $13 billion over the next 5 years. In addition, we've updated our projected cash from operations to reflect a recent extension of bonus depreciation. As a result of these changes, we've reduced our overall projected 5-year financing needs. In 2013, we intend to issue approximately $1 billion of first mortgage bonds to finance our capital expenditures during the first half of the year, including $500 million at PSCo, $400 million at NSP-Minnesota and $100 million at SPS. This morning, we are reaffirming our 2013 ongoing guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 per share. We've updated some of the guidance assumptions to reflect 2012 actual results. Details of these changes can be found in today's press release. In closing, we're pleased to deliver another solid year. Despite experiencing early challenges, we moved aggressively to rightsize our O&M without negatively impacting customer service or safety. These efforts, combined with constructive outcomes in several rate cases and hot summer weather, helped us achieve ongoing earnings growth of 6%, consistent with our 5% to 7% target. As Ben indicated, we have now met or exceeded our annual earnings guidance 8 years in a row. We also raised dividend by nearly 4%, consistent with our goal of 2% to 4% annual increases and marking this as the ninth consecutive year of achieving this objective. We issued $1.8 billion of first mortgage bonds at attractive rates, lowering our coupon rates and extending our maturities. On the regulatory front, we again achieved constructive outcomes in a variety of cases, adding to our solid track record of managing multiple rate cases across our jurisdiction. On the operational front, we made excellent progress on our capital investment program, delivered strong reliability and improved our customer satisfaction scores. Overall, it was another great year for Xcel Energy. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies & Co.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. One is, actually, when I compare third quarter '12 and fourth quarter '12 interest expense, it looks like interest expense has gone down by $10 million. I know, I think, third quarter you guys had some maybe principal payments in there, but that was roughly $3 million. I just want to know if you can give some more color on the $7 million. And the second question is, I guess, you've had an increase in AFUDC year-over-year, I just want to know if you can highlight what projects you have that are building up the equip balance?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, maybe if we start with the AFUDC. In terms of the rate will, in part, be higher because we have higher equip balances this year. So that's a primary driver in terms of the variance there. And then the interest expense, the changes in that, I mean, we basically refinanced a substantial amount of debt during the year. But that was all completed by the end of the third quarter, so the differences are driving that fourth quarter variance.
Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Are there any particular projects though that are driving the higher equip balances?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, it's -- in Minnesota, we've had a lot of spend in CapX2020. We've also had a lot of spend in Clean Air-Clean Jobs in Colorado. So those are the 2 biggest, and Jones 4 also in Texas. So those are the big projects that we're working on right now.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: As you mentioned, your guidance embeds O&M expenses growth of 4% to 5% in 2013. That's a little higher than the utility average and higher than you came in this year as well. Can you provide more details on what's driving this? And is there flexibility to manage this if low disappoints?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, maybe if we could start with 2012 variance to '11, we only had an increase of 1.7%. So we have a relatively low level that we're starting from in 2012. So it's driving somewhat the increase of 4% to 5%. But the drivers in terms of 2013, we'll start with nuclear. We do have some increases in our nuclear costs. The second piece of that is pensions. Pensions, we are assuming now a 4% discount rate, so we're seeing increases in that. And then we have just some -- across the board, some higher insurance, some small amount of bad debt and some chemicals in some of our plant-related costs. In the long run, we expect to go back to a 3% to 4% overall increase on an annual basis.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And in Minnesota, obviously, a lot of attention on the regulatory front there. Do you think there's the possibility of a multi-year rate deal in Minnesota? And if not, should we be thinking about Xcel going back and filing in 2014 for 2015 rates?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, I don't know if I -- first of all, I don't know if I'd classify it as tension, if I heard you right. As far as the multiyear plans go, I mean, the Commission continues to study that and we'll get their reaction -- their formal reaction later in the year. So that, along with some other reasons is the reason why we filed a single test year case this year, and that's what we're proceeding to march forward with. As far as what we'll do in 2014 and 2015 we'll obviously take a look at what the Commission decides on the applicability of a multi-year test years, and we'll file accordingly.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then the last question is in terms of regional trends in terms of demand growth. Are you continuing to see strength in Texas and relative challenges in Minnesota? And what are you seeing in Colorado?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, everything -- overall, on the residential side, it's safe to say everything is pretty flat. So then you move to the C&I side, and actually, the strongest C&I growth was in Wisconsin this year, followed by Texas, I think, followed by Colorado, which had small growth. And then we were -- we didn't grow at all in Minnesota for a number of reasons. That said, the economy definitely saw some signs of improvement in 2012. Housing permits were up. Job growth was better than the national average. Unemployment was equal to or better than the national average. So I think the economies are in decent shape across all our jurisdictions. Doesn't necessarily mean it translates to high sales growth. And that's consistent with our forecast. I mean, we're not anticipating that we're going to see a tremendous rebound in sales, even as the economies start to improve. I mean, I think, that's our new normal, frankly.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: On the 1% decline in gas sales that you're projecting for 2013, what are you seeing now that we're in 2013 and essentially know what some of the drivers would be on that demand side? What are the key drivers that you're seeing on that?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, maybe I'll start with 2013. We haven't closed out January, so we haven't actually seen our January results. But we would expect to see consistent what we saw last year. Again, the drivers of it are primarily the same thing in terms of some efficiency use among our customers, but the same overall trends to a certain degree that we've seen in our electric business.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: What's the EPS impact on that in your guidance?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Very minimal, Travis. There's not a lot of gas margin, so it's not going to have much impact.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Can you again remind us, Teresa, at the OpCo level, what's the current regulatory lag in your system in terms of earned ROEs versus authorized?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, the regulatory lag tends to be between 50 to 100 basis points, and it's going to depend which jurisdiction has had the most recent rate increase in place. So we tend to have more regulatory lag, like in Texas, where we're using a historical test year. Although I will say that in terms of ROEs relative to the 2012 period, they actually ended up in the 9%. So really, if we just look at 2012, all utilities, except for NSP-Min, we're in 9% return range, actually in the middle, and NSP-Minnesota was slightly less than 9%. But we're seeing some regulatory lag in part. That's why we're filing such a large case.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And also on that Minnesota case, how concerned are you guys about this recent -- the request that the Commission posed to you about looking at potentially reducing the authorized equity ratio? Can you give us some insight on that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, Ali, I mean, we're always concerned when we're filing a rate case. But I mean, we've been filing rate cases for a number of years now and these issues are always reviewed. What is the Commission going to be interested in? The appropriate ROE, the appropriate equity ratio, whether expenses are justified. And I think we'll do fine in just all of those areas. I mentioned, and I think Teresa did too, I mean, we issued some of the lowest record coupons of debt last year. Well, you can't do that unless you have a good credit profile. And if you -- and I think our Commissions understand that. And so while I think it gets looked at, I think, at the end of the day, the constructive regulatory compact continues.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And also, the impact of bonus depreciation, as we look into '13, your share count still implies some potential for equity issuance on the higher end. But can you just give us an update on your insights there because of bonus depreciation? Is it less likely as you'll issue equity this year or what are you thinking right now?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, I mean, as you can see in the release, Ali, we expect -- we have changed that number now to $400 million over the next 5 years. We do have, as you can see, our capital program is very front-end loaded in terms of the 5-year period. So we do think we have flexibility in terms of issuing equity and it probably will be more front-end loaded, either 2013 or 2014. But we've provided for that range and that's really indicating we do believe we have some flexibility.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Last question, also, if you can remind us, if you look at your CapEx program '13 through '17, if you translate that into rate base growth using '12 as a base year, so over the next 5 years, what kind of rate base growth does that support?
Teresa S. Madden: If we look at the first 2 years, I mean, we continue at our 6% rate, and then that will -- that'd be '13 and '14, and then, of course then, we taper down after that through the remainder of the period.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: What, like 5% to 10%?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes, it's around there.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Yes, and, Ali, I think it's important to note that we are not anticipating a tremendous amount of sales growth. Therefore, we aren't anticipating the need for new generation. So, as you know, having followed us for years, our CapEx forecasts can certainly change as those out years become the current years. And we'll look at what's happening with the economy and what our customer needs are, et cetera. I think as we've also spoke about, if those CapEx plans don't change, Teresa is right, the rate base grow slows and that will translate to slower growth for us and of course, that's when we can do more with the dividend. And I think we've got lots of options to reward investors.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Macquarie capital.
Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research: A few questions on behalf of Angie Storozynski. First question is you talked quite a bit qualitatively about the load growth expectations, but can you give us the number that you're expecting for 2013 and in the long term?
Teresa S. Madden: Sure. I mean, in terms of 2013, maybe if I just talk about it by operating company. We're -- for NSP-Minnesota, we're looking at a decrease of about 1.2%, NSP-Wisconsin expected to be flat. In Colorado, just under 1%, actually, that's more about 0.6%. And in Colorado -- I mean, excuse me, and in Texas, over -- just around 3%, I would say. So overall, we expect it to come in between up to 0.5% on a consolidated basis.
Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research: And in the longer term?
Teresa S. Madden: In the longer term, for the next 5 years, we're projecting just up to 1%.
Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research: Okay, great. Then with the CapEx, obviously some downsizing of certain -- or termination of projects and downsizing of the overall. Are there any other projects that you see as particularly at risk if the load growth doesn't recover or gets worse?
Teresa S. Madden: I don't think we see any particularly at risk. I mean, a lot of them are infrastructure projects. We have some transmission projects that are underway that we need to complete like CapX2020. We have some larger ones in progress in Texas as well, so in terms of that risk, we don't see that right now.
Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research: Okay, great. Then lastly, you've talked in the past about the long-term EPS guidance of 5% to 7%. Is that still your target and expectation?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Well, I mean, as Teresa and I both said, I think that's our expectation for the next couple of years. And after that, we'll have to take a look at what happens with our CapEx plans. Again, we're not -- as we just spoke to, we're not anticipating too much sales growth. That would certainly change. We'll have to see how the regulatory outcomes proceed and the macroeconomic conditions, et cetera, and environmental regulations which, by the way, we're very well-positioned to meet. But if the CapEx forecast stays the same, yes, I think you'll see that EPS growth rate modulate as we -- and again, it gives us a chance to take a look at what the growth rate of our dividend ought to be.
Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research: Okay, very good. And just one last thing here. You mentioned, I believe, that in the quarter, Wisconsin was actually stronger than Texas. Yet for '13, you're expecting Wisconsin flat and Texas up 3%. Was there anything unusual in the quarter in Wisconsin driving that?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: We were speaking year-to-date, weren't we, right?
Teresa S. Madden: Yes. We were speaking year-to-date. And what Ben indicated, we have seen some uptick in the sand mining industry. So maybe we have some more upside in Wisconsin as we look forward. But we're being conservative about that. Clearly, we've seen the oil and gas impact.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Michael Bates with D.A. Davidson & Co.
Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: If we could, I'd like to circle back to your financing plan a little bit. When you compare this forecast with what you had previously indicated, it looks like your cash from operations increased roughly $400 million, can you just go over that with us again? What has changed in the last few months that drove that increase?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, there's 2 things that have changed. First, we've taken out the $200 million related to the EPU uprate in Minnesota that we're -- that's the Prairie Island, which we're not pursuing. And then we've also incorporated the impacts of -- President Obama just signed into law the extension of bonus depreciation for 2013 at the 50% level, which for us, will actually continue into 2014, because of our long-term projects. So it's a combination of those that are driving the decrease in terms of that need.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Eli Kraicer with Millennium Partners.
Steven Gambuzza: It's actually Steve Gambuzza. The impacts of bonus depreciation that you just highlighted, can you just review the impact that it will have on the rate base that you've, I guess, previously disclosed for '13 and '14?
Teresa S. Madden: Sure. I mean, in total, it's about $300 million, about 2/3 of that or about $200 million in '13, and $100 million in '14.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: One more. What's the situation in Boulder? An update there? And any impacts in 2013 or even 2014 depending on how the negotiations go?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: I don't think there will any impacts in '13 or '14. I mean, what's going on there is that the staff, the consultants, et cetera, will make a recommendation to the city council whether or not they go forward, and that's supposed to take place, I believe, in April?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, February, yes.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: February is when they get the recommendation, and they'll rule on it in April.
Teresa S. Madden: Right.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: And so we'll see. But regardless, I mean, we currently serve them, as you know, Travis. And so if they decide they don't want to serve us, that begins what is a pretty lengthy and long process, and we'll continue to serve them through that process.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Andy Levi with Avon capital.
Andrew Levi: Just back to Minnesota because I think there's been some, I don't know if you want us to call it misinformation or maybe people being a little bit overzealous in their assumptions. But just back to the kind of equity debt issue that's been brought up, I know you made a filing on Friday regarding that. Can you kind of just talk about that as far as what your perception is on what may or may not happen? And then there's been 1 or 2 sales side reports that have talked about fairly, not large numbers, but as much as $0.10 of possible earnings effect from that, which we can't come up with anywhere close to that. So I don't know if there's a way that you can walk us through kind of looking at the rate base and how that would be affected if there was a 1% or 2% change in the debt/equity ratio. And if there was, I don't know how you would get there, would you buy back stock? How would that work?
Benjamin G. S. Fowke: Okay. Well, Andy, let me take a stab at it and I'll ask for help if we're not completing your question. I mean, the first thing, I think, you noted is our capital structure study was approved. And that has, I believe, the 52-point-something equity ratio in it. So -- and I think the questions were raised were how do we take advantage of this historically low interest rate environment, which of course we are. And we're doing that now because we can issue debt with good credit ratings which results in these great rates. So obviously, if you were to dilute that credit rating through a poor equity structure, you wouldn't be able to take advantage of that. So having the capital structure approved, I think, was a good signal. The other question, I think you asked was on an analyst's report that said if the ROE, I think, fell 500 basis points, it would have a $0.10 impact. I mean, we struggle a little bit to get that number too, and that's a pretty big fall. I think that also doesn't assume, Andy, that we would take any reaction to it, which I think is the latter part of your question. Certainly, if we had a major adjustment to our credit ratio, we'd have to adjust our financing plan. And I mean, there would be a number of ways you could do that. You would reduce equity injections from the whole co, et cetera, and you'd get the equity ratio to where the Commission wanted it to be. I don't think that would be a good result ultimately for our customers. And I do think that there has been more emphasis placed on it than perhaps it warrants. Again, we've got, I think, a thoughtful Commission and we've got a constructive regulatory compact. It's never easy to file rate cases. We take it very seriously. But all you have to look at is what are we trying to accomplish? Relicensing our nuclear plants for another 20 years, keeping our infrastructure reliable and resilient and being on the forefront of getting ready for these environmental challenges, which I think really are starting to pay dividend for our customers as we look at mats, rules and other things like that, that we've been very well prepared for. So I do think there's any question we're spending our money in the right place. And I don't think there's any question that a strong balance sheet is necessary to complete these capital programs. So, biggest risk we face every year is public policy risk, and we've been facing it for years and managing it. And I'm cautiously optimistic we'll have a good year managing those rate cases this year as well.
Andrew Levi: And then the other question I had is based on the refinancings that you did in 2012, and then I guess we saw in the fourth quarter, and I understand that you'll be issuing more debt. But just on the refinancing, how much is the annual savings do you think on that?
Teresa S. Madden: The annual savings was about $30 million to $35 million from the refinancing.
Andrew Levi: Okay. And how much of that was realized in 2012?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, some of our midyear -- I mean, I would say about half potentially.
Operator: And at this, time I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden: Sure. Thank you for all participating in our year-end earnings call this morning. Please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to listen to a replay of today's conference, please dial 1 (800) 406-7325 or (303) 590-3030, using the access code of 4577479 followed by the pound key.

Executives: Paul Johnson - Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Management Ben Fowke - Chairman, President and CEO Teresa Madden - Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Sparby - Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President Scott Wilensky - Senior Vice President and General Counsel George Tyson - Vice President and Treasurer Jeff Savage - Vice President and Controller

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be provided at that time. (Operator Instructions) I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today Thursday October 25, 2012 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Management. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. And welcome to Xcel Energy’s 2012 third quarter earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. This morning we will provide with you an update on third quarter results and recent business developments, update you on our 2012 guidance and introduce our new five-year capital forecast, financing plan and 2013 earnings guidance. There are slides that accompany today’s conference call available on our webpage. In addition, we will post a brief video of Teresa Madden summarizing our financial results on the website. As a reminder, some of the comments during this morning’s conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today’s press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2012 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.81 per share reflect a $0.03 per share positive impact of a restoration of a tax benefit previously expensed in 2012 associated with federal subsidies for prescription drug plans. This benefit is not included in ongoing earnings, which is consistent with our treatment in 2010. Management believes ongoing earnings which remove the impact of non-recurring items provide a more meaningful comparison. As a result, comments this morning will focus on going earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over the Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Well, thanks Paul, and good morning. I’m very pleased to report that 2012 third quarter ongoing earnings increased 13% to $0.78 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in 2011. As you know, we made -- make it a priority to invest in our system with projects that provide long-term value to our customers. We achieve constructive and timely recovery of such investments in several jurisdictions, which contributed to this quarter’s performance. In addition, O&M expenses decreased slightly for the quarter reflecting our continued cost control measures. Finally, warmer than normal weather increased third quarter earnings by just over $0.07 per share, since we also experienced a hot summer last year this summer’s weather didn’t create a variance when making the quarterly comparison. Our third quarter earnings are in contrast with the rather slow start we had to the year, marked by warm winter weather, lower sales and a couple of disappointing regulatory decisions. Recall that we responded immediately by implementing cost control measures to partially offset these negative factors, an indicative we expected to deliver earnings within the lower half of our guidance range. With continued careful cost management and the improvement in weather during the summer, we now expect to deliver 2012 ongoing earnings within our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Our 2012 GAAP earnings are expected to be in the upper half of the guidance range as a result of the $0.03 per share tax benefit that, Paul, just discussed. Teresa will discuss our quarterly earnings in greater detail in a few moments. I’ll now comment on a few recent developments starting with the introduction of our updated five-year capital forecast, which you will find in our earnings release. We anticipate spending approximately $13.2 billion over the next -- over the five-year timeframe of 2013 to 2017. This is slightly less than our previous forecast. Additionally, we have reduced our projected equity needs by $350 million. The reduction in future equity needs is primarily driven by lower capital investment, the timing of those investments and improved cash flows. Let me highlight some of the changes to the updated capital forecast. Our previous capital forecast included $470 million of investment to meet CSAPR requirements in Texas. We have removed the SPS environmental projects from our forecast following the court’s decision to vacate CSAPR. The court stated that the EPA must continue administering care pending adoption of a valid replacement. At SPS, we plan to comply with care through modest allowance purchases beginning in 2015. Longer term, it’s possible that future regulations could require the addition of FCRs and scrubbers at our SPS coal facilities. However, because of the uncertainty of any additional regulations, including timing, these potential investments are expected to be beyond the current five-year forecast. Our updated capital forecast also reflects increased infrastructure investment, particularly related to natural gas pipeline integrity and electric distribution projects. Most of the larger projects, such as CapX2020, the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act and the nuclear upgrade and life extension remain significant components of the five-year plan. I do want to point out that this forecast includes the Prairie Island upgrade project which represents about $200 million of CapX spend primarily in 2016 and 2017. Earlier this year, we filed a Change of Circumstance with the Minnesota Commission, because the benefits of this project had narrowed since it was originally proposed. While under review circumstances have continued to evolve and now indicate that the benefits of the upgrade are less than we anticipated in our March filing. At this point, we conclude that further investment in the project will not benefit our customers. The project is being reviewed by the commission, as well as other parties and we expect a determination sometime in 2013. Return in operations, we continue to make great progress on our CapX2020 transmission project. The first four projects representing approximately 700 miles and $1 billion of capital investment for Xcel Energy have all received state regulatory approval and are now in construction phase. Approximately one half of this project’s planned investment will be made in 2012 and 2013. In September, the second segment of the Bemidji-Grand Rapids transmission line was completed and energized, entire 70-mile line is now in service. Overall, the CapX2020 transmission project remains on time and on budget, demonstrating our continued ability to manage complicated projects and deliver value to all our stakeholders. Looking ahead, 2013 will be an active year for us, as we plan to file several rate cases this fall. In early November, we’ll file a Minnesota Electric Rate Case, which will reflect significant capital investment going into service associated with nuclear and other infrastructure projects, as well as the decline in electric sales that we’d experienced in Minnesota. Teresa will speak to the drivers of that request in a few moments. We also plan to make filings for Colorado gas and electric filings in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota before the end of the year. All of which are in addition to open dockets in South Dakota and Wisconsin. So 2013 will be a busy regulatory year for us. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today I will discuss third quarter results, provide an update on our regulatory proceedings, review our 2012 financing plan and update you on our 2012 and 2013 earnings guidance. Let’s begin by reviewing our third quarter results at each of our four operating companies. Third quarter earnings at PSCo increased $0.07 per share, primarily due to an electric rate increase implemented in May associated with the approved multi-year plan. Quarterly results also benefited from lower O&M expenses and warmer summer weather. For 2012 we are on track to earn close to our authorized ROE of 10% in Colorado. Earnings at NSP-Minnesota declined $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, NSP-Minnesota earnings were down on a year-to-date basis driven by sluggish sales, increased property taxes, higher O&M expense and unfavorable weather. In 2012, we expect to earn well below our authorized ROE. Clearly, this highlights the need to file our 2013 electric rate case in Minnesota. SPS earnings increased $0.02 per share for the quarter. New rate increases in New Mexico and Texas implemented in January were partially offset by the impact of milder weather, higher depreciation experience and property taxes. We currently project SPS to earn in the mid 9% range in 2012. Finally, third quarter earnings at NSP-Wisconsin were flat. In 2012, we expect NSP-Wisconsin to earn in the upper 9% ROE range. On a consolidated basis, we continue to project our 2012 ROE will be greater than 10%. I will now discuss some of the key drivers that affected the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Third quarter electric margin increased $57 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $46 million from new rate increases in several states including Colorado, $13 million from increased conservation and DSM expenses, and $11 million from higher transmission revenue. These positive items were partially offset by lower firm wholesale revenues due to the expiration of a long-term agreement with Black Hills Corporation in January 2012. We continue to experience sluggish sales trend. On a year-to-date and weather normalized basis, electric sales were flat. However, if you adjust for the additional day of sales due to leap year, electric sales got actually declined three tenths of a percent. Part of this decline is due to the loss of one of our largest customers in Minnesota. In May, the Verso Paper Mill in Sartell, Minnesota experienced a fire. The company subsequently decided not to reopen the facility. In 2011, this paper mill represented approximately 1.4% of total retail electric sales at NSP-Minnesota and six tenth of a percent of Xcel Energy’s retail electric sales. On a consolidated basis, we continue to forecast flat sales levels for 2012. Turning to expenses, we continue to successfully manage O&M in an effort to match our spending with the negligible sales growth we’ve experienced to date as well as other headwinds we’ve faced in 2012. As a result of the cost management initiatives that we began implementing in January, our O&M expenses were essentially flat for both the third quarter and the year-to-date period. However, we don’t expect to maintain the flat O&M trend for the remainder of the year. After experiencing a hot summer, we plan to put some money into our system to ensure that we continue to maintain high levels of reliability. Also, after corresponding merit increases earlier this year, we reinstated them in October. As a result, we now expect 2012 O&M expense to increase by approximately 2% for the year. Other taxes increased approximately $11.6 million or about 13% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. As a reminder, our request for deferred accounting treatment was denied by the Minnesota Commission earlier this year. Higher property taxes incurred in Colorado related to the electric retail business are being deferred as part of the multiyear rate settlement approved by the Colorado commission in May. I will now provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. We currently have three notable regulatory proceedings underway. We filed for rate relief in South Dakota and Wisconsin. Late last week, the Wisconsin staff filed their recommendation which we viewed as constructive. In Colorado, we are seeking recovery of the full amount of our smart grid city investment. Details of these cases are provided in our earnings release. We anticipate resolution of each of these cases later this year. In addition, we continue to make preparations to file several cases before year end, including electric cases in Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas as well as the gas case in Colorado. We’ll be able to discuss these cases in more detail at our year-end conference call in January. In Minnesota, we plan to fill an electric rate case next week. Until the case is filed, there are limited details that we can share with you. Our plan is to file a one-year 2013 test year rate case with interim rates expected to be effective in January 2013. Primary drivers of the case are the continued high level of investment to keep our system safe and reliable over the long-term such as our investments extend the lives of our nuclear plant and obtain more power from the Monticello nuclear facility. Recovery of these investments as well as other general business cost increases would be at the level you would expect given our CapEx progress. This case will also address the increases in property tax that we have experienced which we forecast to be even higher in 2013. In addition, we will reset rates using current projected sales levels which are lower than what we used in our most recent rate case driven primarily by the economy and the loss of some large customers. We also plan to include proposals for how we can help support economic growth to help mitigate the sales effects over time. We are looking forward to working constructively with stakeholders and customers as we file and move through the case. We plan to file the one-year rate case we remain interested in working with the parties to arrive at a framework that can address 2014 and beyond to better manage the financial impact of substantial capital investment in an environment with flat or declining electric sales. The Minnesota Commission has opened the proceeding on a multiyear rate plan. Assuming that process results in a constructive framework, we would expect to submit a plan during 2013 or 2014 and beyond. We will continue to participate in this ongoing docket which will serve to help shape its filing. Now, I would like to update you on the completion of our 2012 financing plan. We’re pleased to have the opportunity to take advantage of historically low interest rates, issuing a total of $1.8 billion of first mortgage bonds in 2012. During the third quarter and into early October, we issued $800 million of first mortgage bonds at both NSP-Minnesota, and PSCo, as well as $100 million at first mortgage bond at NSP-Wisconsin. As a result of these transactions, we dramatically lowered our cost of debt and extended maturities. This was particularly true at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo where we refinanced over $1.2 billion in bonds that had interest rates of about 8%. Notably, the NSP-Minnesota $300 million 10-year tranche priced at 2.15% coupons, and the $500 million 30-year tranche priced at 3.4% coupon. Both of these represented record low utility coupons for their respective tenor. The PSCo bonds were issued at slightly higher rates but still among the lowest for the utility sector. These bonds will provide low-cost capital for our customer for years to come. One additional financing related item, Moody’s recently downgraded SPS by one notch based on the expected moderation of SPS’s credit metrics due to high levels of capital expenditures and regulatory lag. The outlook is now stable. Considering the significant planned investment in the SPS system over the next five years, strong credit metrics and timely recovery of costs are critical. Clearly, we’ll continue to work with our stakeholders, including state regulatory commissioners and staff, the Office of the Attorney General, key large customers, consumer advocates, state government officials and others to reinforce the importance of timely recovery associated with these investments, as this is a critical factor in our decision-making process. Turning to our earnings guidance, we expect 2012 ongoing earnings guidance to be within the $1.75 to $1.85 range. However, GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the upper half of the range due to the tax benefit previously discussed. In a year, where we’ve faced stiff headwinds early, we take great pride in our efforts to position the company to deliver earnings within our guidance range for the eighth year in a row. Looking ahead, we’re initiating our 2013 earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.95. Based on the midpoint of our guidance range for both 2012 and 2013, this would represent 6% earnings growth, consistent with our 5% to 7% target. The key assumptions for 2013 are outlined in today’s press release. I’ll now share with you some details behind a few of the assumptions. We assume constructive outcomes in all rate case proceedings. We forecast consolidated weather-adjusted electric utility sales growth of 0.5%. However, the forecast does vary by operating company. We anticipate sales growth of approximately 1% at PSCo, sales declines of approximately 1% at NSP-Minnesota, sales growth of approximately 3% at SPS, and flat sales at NSP-Wisconsin. For natural gas, we are projecting a weather-adjusted firm sales decline of 1%. O&M expenses are forecasted to increase 4 to 5%. The primary drivers include rising pensions, medical and nuclear costs in addition to our continued capital investment in our system. Depreciation is expected to increase $70 million to $80 million, also driven by continued capital investment in our system. Property taxes are expected to increase $35 million. As a result of recent refinancing to take advantage of the low coupon debt, we expect interest expense to decline by $30 million to $35 million. And, finally, our 2013 EPS guidance is based on a range of 490 million to 500 million common share equivalent. In closing, we are pleased to deliver another strong quarter, well positioning the company to meet our earnings objectives for the eighth consecutive year. Looking ahead, our guidance range for 2013 is consistent with our plan to grow earnings 5% to 7% annually. Before I turn the call over to you for questions, I’d like to comment on our plans for our annual analyst meeting. Over the last several months, we’ve spoken with many of you regarding the frequency with which we host our analyst meetings. The feedback we’ve received clearly indicated that holding the meeting every other year or as needed was sufficient. As a result, we won’t be hosting an Analyst Meeting this December. However, we currently intend to host one in December of 2013. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar Securities Research. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research: Good morning, thanks.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Travis.
Teresa Madden: Good Morning.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research: You guys mentioned in the release, the cost savings initiatives that helped keep that O&M flat. And as you’ve suggested a pretty modest 2% for the full year, can you detail what some of those have been this year and how sustainable, I guess those are?
Teresa Madden: Well, we started the year in terms of an overall looking across the board in terms of where we could eliminate what we would called discretionary items, and so that could be some consulting costs. We eliminated our wage increase, which we have reinstated. But generally they were just across the board, where we looked for opportunities to lower our overall costs.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research: Okay. And you expect those to be, other than the wage increase, obviously, you expect some of those to be sustainable?
Teresa Madden: Yeah. We do.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities Research: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kit Konolige from BGC. Please go ahead.
Kit Konolige - BGC: Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning, Kit.
Teresa Madden: Good morning.
Kit Konolige - BGC: So just to follow a little on your discussion of the five-year CapEx outlook and your equity plans, I think you mentioned, Teresa, the driver of the lowered equity needs was partly less CapEx, partly higher cash from operations, if you can go into a little detail on those points?
Teresa Madden: Well, Kit, the CapEx, if we look at the five-year period, even though it’s slightly different, in terms of 12 to 16 or 13 to 17 it’s still just over a $13 billion. But two important things, in terms of removing CSAPR, we had a higher front end. We’ve added some infrastructure costs in PSCo, in terms of the gas replacement program. The removing of the CSAPR project had some regulatory lag with it and whereas, if we are assuming relative to the gas infrastructure, we do have a rider in place, or through this rate based recovery that will help us work towards having a lower equity requirement.
Kit Konolige - BGC: And is that, that’s the primary driver of the delta in your expected equity needs?
Teresa Madden: It really is, yeah, because over the period, the spend is pretty much the same in terms of just over $13 billion.
Kit Konolige - BGC: Great. Can you discuss the timing of the equity issuance at all?
Teresa Madden: Well, we don’t need equity in 2012. We believe in 2013 or 2014, we could have the need for equity, but it’s going to depend on a lot of things that we consider. Overall market decisions, the ultimate timing of spend, credit metrics, we’ll take that all into consideration.
Ben Fowke: I think the good news, Kit, is we’re going need a lot less equity and that gives us a lot more flexibility going forward.
Kit Konolige - BGC: I agree, that sounds like good news and can you maybe touch on the dividend a little bit in that context as well. I think in the past, the discussion has been along the lines that dividend growth would be less than EPS growth for a number of years, while the large CapEx budget was in place as that declines. Maybe that relationship between dividend and EPS growth changes some. Should we be thinking any differently about that at this point?
Ben Fowke: No. I think what we said before and how we reward investors between the dividend and EPS growth still holds true, Kit. I mean, we still have a lot of rate based growth obviously in the next couple of years. And just like our equity needs, we’ve got a lot of flexibility and what we can do with the dividend. I mean, we’ve got, I think, a pretty modest payout ratio compared to our peers. So it’s an arrow in the proverbial quiver, if you will.
Kit Konolige - BGC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Thank you. Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Hey, Ben. Ben or Teresa, the $13.2 billion of CapEx spend budget for ‘13 through ‘17, could you then remind us what kind of annual rate-based growth does that support say ‘12 over ‘13 and ‘17 over that five-year period?
Ben Fowke: I think we’re still growing in that 6% to 7% clip, Ali.
Dave Sparby: At least through 2014, Ali. Post that it will start to come down as CapEx comes down.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay. Okay. But and I don’t have a chance to look at the numbers themselves. So I mean, if I do it over a five-year period, 5% to 6% that would be reasonable?
Ben Fowke: Yeah. I think that’s probably right.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay. And then on the equity issue question, so the share count increase that you guys are assuming for ‘13 in your guidance right now. Obviously that the range there, so right now is that assuming drip, or I’m assuming, I guess, the higher end of that would include equity issuance as well. Can you give us a little better handle on that check on range for ‘13 and how you’re thinking about equity in there?
Teresa Madden: Well, we’re still assuming that we would have our drip and benefit programs in place at the same level, which has been around $80 million a year. And then we put the range in to provide for some flexibility as I was just indicating. But it could be 2013, it could be 2014. And as we move forward, we’ll just consider all the circumstances and it could be either of the years. And that’s why we indicated a range this year.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: I see. And final question, you laid out also your load forecast obviously for full year this year and for next year. Can you remind us the earnings sensitivities? We should think about 1% move in load, what that means for EPS for you guys?
Teresa Madden: Generally, 1% load can range from margins at $20 million to $30 million. It just depends on which jurisdiction it’s in because we earn differently. And so that’s what causes the range between $20 million to $30 million.
Ben Fowke: And also with customer class.
Teresa Madden: Yeah. That’s true.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Is that electric, gas or is that a culmination of the two?
Teresa Madden: That’s electric.
Ben Fowke: Gas is much lower.
Teresa Madden: Correct.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: All right. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Paz from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to go back to one point you made on the regulatory lag and how it corresponds with the CapEx. I think said higher -- you expect higher cash flow from operations in this five-year plan versus the prior plan, due to like more spend on the gas side which has a rider and less spend on electric side which in the region, in the jurisdiction that still has some regulatory lag. Is that the increase roughly, does that explain the increase of, I don’t know, I think it was like 400 million in your cash flow from operations plan versus the prior plan?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think it’s a function of the reduction in overall CapEx spend. That’s about $200 million. And then improvement in the cash flows that Teresa mentioned is the other half of that basically. And that’s just, that’s a function of when we put the spend in and for CSAPR and remember, that was front end loaded. That’s another factor that helps us reduce the equity needs that we have a smoother spend. When we put that in, we did not have the regulatory recovery mechanism established.  Now, we were obviously going seek that and we’ll continue to seek that going forward, if we do have to make environmental spend. But at this point, we didn’t have it. We had regulatory lag, contrast that with our infrastructure spend in Colorado, where we do have a rider and which eliminates lag. So, that’s the delta that Teresa and we’re referring to.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Okay. Great. That helps a lot. My other question, just in your transmission line item other major projects notice both slight bump in 2017. I’m just curious is there a major transmission project down in the pipe that maybe we’ve missed here?
Ben Fowke: I don’t think, so we’re obviously have our CapX2020 programs, which are lined out that in program and then the other major CapX programs would be at SPS and some in Colorado. But these are all projects that we’ve been discussing.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. And on interest costs, I just want to make sure I understand the decline for 2013, embedded in your 2013 guidance versus 2012. Is it really just a function of the lower interest cost -- lower interest rate or there are some maybe terms out before their maturity dates?
Teresa Madden: And it’s primarily the interest rate.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And last question, just in terms of your weather benefit year-to-date, I know you have for Q1, but better rest of the year, just what the net weather benefit year-to-date?
Teresa Madden: The net…
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Versus normal.
Teresa Madden: Is $0.05.
David Paz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eli Kraicer from Millennium Partners. Please go ahead.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Good morning. It’s actually Steven Gambuzza.
Ben Fowke: Hi, Steve.
Teresa Madden: Good morning.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Good morning. The rate case that you’re going to file in Minnesota, what will be the test year for that rate case?
Teresa Madden: 2013.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay. And so you’ll use a forecasted capital structure for -- the balance sheet, there is no update so just being entirely forecasted capital set of financials?
Teresa Madden: That’s correct.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay. And just on the CapEx forecast, I know you spent some time in your opening remarks talking about the op rates. Have you left, I guess is the op rates spend really into the Minnesota project, which you discussed is that still in the CapEx forecast or is that been removed?
Ben Fowke: It’s the $200 million spend is still in there.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay.
Ben Fowke: It’s in the ‘16 and ‘17 timeframe.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay. So, if your request to the regulator is granted then you will not spend that money?
Ben Fowke: Correct.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay. And then just back to you some of David’s questions on the rider. It sounds like I was looking at the nature of the capital changes. It looks like distribution CapEx for electric went up by about, both electric and gas distribution spend went up by 20 to 30% versus the prior forecast and is most of that spend now rider eligible like I know you have it in Colorado, do you -- this increase in CapEx that you have for both electric and gas distribution is the majority of that going to fall under riders?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think the gas spend as we talked about should be under a rider. The electric spend, which assumed in a multiyear plan. And -- but most of it is going to be picked up in general rate cases. And obviously, we’re trying to go to multiyear and some other things to cover that. But it’s really a reflection by the way of just aging infrastructure. And we’ve done a really good job with reliability for our customers. And we want to continue to keep that high standard in existence and it takes investment. And I think our commissions will see that.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay. And then my final question is just on the transmission CapEx. I’m looking at that updated table and I see the CapX2020 spend in the 2013 to ‘15 timeframe. And then there is other major transmission project, $320 million in ‘16 and $415 million in ‘17. Can you just remind us what projects those are they -- I’m sure I know you talked about it a bunch of the sites CapX2020 just wanted to get a feel for -- is this a handful of projects or a bunch of projects?
Ben Fowke: Probably in between a handful and a bunch.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Okay.
Ben Fowke: We’ve got both. And we have TUCO, Moreland project, the Hitchland-Woodward project in Texas. We’ve got the step projects in Texas. And PSCo some of the SP 100 are relatively small to the end of the five-year timeframe. A number of smaller projects, we have some things going on in Wisconsin as well, so…
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Nothing, no large -- no one or two large projects that are driving it?
Ben Fowke: No. But they’re not -- I mean a lot of those projects are covered through. The major projects that we refer to in the table the majority of those are covered by riders.
Steven Gambuzza - Millennium Partners: Great. Thanks very much for your time.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Ryder from PartnerRe Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management: Yeah. Hi. With the five year CapEx spending so front-end loaded. I’m just wondering roughly how much debt you plan to issue in 2013. And then how that affects the credit metrics, if you don’t issue equity?
Teresa Madden: We’re planning to issue as right around $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion.
Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management: And the credit metrics?
Teresa Madden: They’ll stay the same as they are which we are assuming that we have in the release.
Ben Fowke: I mean we shared this, our plan with rating agencies. And so everybody -- we’re very transparent about what the metrics look like with both investors and the credit agencies.
Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management: Okay. And then just one quick question on how much more secured debt you can issue at SPS before you trip the negative pledge in the existing bonds?
Ben Fowke: It’s about $160 million.
Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management: And will you hit that limit next year?
Ben Fowke: Not necessarily.
Mark Ryder - PartnerRe Asset Management: All right. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Cleo Zagrean from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital: Hi, good morning. Could you please remind us of your expectations both ‘13 in terms of trend growth rate for EPS given the slower load growth. And did you CapEx now we understand most likely it’s going to be $13 billion. And any update on the mix between -- mix growth and dividend yield for total return? Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Your first and second question kind of have the same answer for both. I think we continue to see some pretty robust rate based growth over the next couple years. You get into that ‘14 time frame and beyond, perhaps it modulates a bit. There is a number of factors that will affect how much it modulates. But overall, we’re very confident that the total shareholder return of 10% can be met, whether it’s a little less on EPS growth and a little more on dividend that mix ultimately remains to be seen, based upon a number of variables. But we’ve got a lot of levers I think to use to continue to reward our shareholders.
Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital: Thank you. And as a follow-up with regards to load growth challenges, can you give us a brief overview of the types of regulatory recovery you’re looking for besides accounting for a lower growth rate in your request. And the signals you’ve received so far from regulators in terms of progress on formula rates. We -- my impression was that you were hoping maybe to move faster in Minnesota? Thank you.
Ben Fowke: The formula rates, you mean the multiyear plan?
Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital: Yes.
Ben Fowke: It’s not really a formula rate. But -- that the progress on a multiyear plan has gone a bit slower in Minnesota than we originally thought. There’s a docket that’s been opened and it will be very much addressed in ‘13. But we need to file a rate case now. So we filed a rate case. We’ll continue to work with parties to develop a plan that might make sense. And part of that will be economic development, frankly and address things like how we help be part of the solution to get sales back on track in the state. I think that’s an important thing we can do and we have done. We already have examples of that, by the way that have played very well with our stakeholders. So having regulatory certainty, having our plans understood by our stakeholders, those ultimate lead to multiyear plans, but in the meantime we’ll file a rate case. Last time we did it, we did the same way. We got a step increase for the off years. So there’s a lot of different ways that we can ensure that we have appropriate regulatory recovery. And I’m actually pretty excited about the ways we can help improve sales growth and encourage growth in the state. You’ll see that in rate design, I’m sorry you’ll see that in rate designs some other things that will offer.
Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital: Thank you.
Ben Fowke: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Yee from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Yee - Keybanc Capital Markets: Yeah. Just one quick question. For your plan rate filings in the other jurisdiction other than Minnesota, which I think would be New Mexico and North Dakota or Texas and Colorado gas, when would you expect those new rates to be in place by?
Teresa Madden: It varies by the jurisdictions. In North Dakota, we would expect interim rates early. Texas would be in the latter part of next year. New Mexico would be potentially about the same. Colorado gas that’s right…
Ben Fowke: ‘14.
Teresa Madden: New Mexico would be 2014. And then Colorado gas would be by the winter season next year.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you. Welcome to Xcel Energy's second quarter 2012 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Revenue Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; and Jeff Savage, Vice President and Controller. Today, we will provide you with an update on recent business developments, discuss second quarter results, and update you on our 2012 guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany today's call which are available on our webpage. In addition, we will also post a short video at our website with Teresa Madden summarizing our results. We encourage you to check it out. As a reminder, some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to, Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Paul and good morning. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.38 per share compared with $0.33 per share in 2011. New electric rates in Colorado, combined with warmer than normal June weather across our service territory and continued strong expense control, led to our solid second quarter results. As a result, we remain on track to deliver 2012 earnings in the lower half of our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments. I will now provide you a few recent developments, starting with an operational update. I am pleased to report that our operating systems performed very well throughout the recent period of hot weather across our service territory. Record temperatures drove new peak demands in several states with only minimal service interruptions. In addition to the record heat, numerous severe storms occurred in our northern service territory. Excellent response, planning and performance during system outage events minimized customer impacts and our crew has performed their work safely under difficult conditions. In addition to reliability, our efforts to provide value to our customers are also reflected in two recently proposed transactions. This summer, we agreed to purchase the Brush assets for $75 million. The Brush assets consist of three gas-fired generating units with a total capacity of 237 megawatts. These plants currently provide energy and capacity to PSCo under purchase power agreements that are set to expire in 2017 and 2022. While smaller, this transaction is very similar to our acquisition of generation assets from Calpine in late 2010 which provided benefits to both customers and investors. The Brush acquisition has many positive attributes including saving our customers' money beginning in the first year. Additionally, owning these peaking plants will give us greater control over our resources. Purchase is subject to various regulatory approvals including the Colorado Commission. We anticipate this transaction will close in early 2013. We have also asked the commission to consider our request to retire at the end of 2013 Arapahoe unit 4, a 109 megawatt coal-fired power plant. Previously we planned to switch this unit to natural gas. We have proposed replacing the retired unit with a PPA. One final item, before I turn the call over to Teresa. As you know, in December 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a request to defer incremental 2012 property taxes or alternatively that a property tax rider be approved. In June, the Minnesota Commission voted to deny our request for deferred accounting for incremental property taxes and also denied our request for property tax rider. Despite our disappointment in their decision, we believe the regulatory compact in Minnesota remains constructive. We felt our circumstances merited deferred accounting treatment, however the Commission ultimately ruled that this request did not meet the strict requirements for a deferral. As a result, we will continue to expense the full $24 million of incremental property taxes in 2012 resulting in a drag of approximately $0.03 per share on our 2012 earnings. Now we considered accelerating the filing of our 2013 Minnesota electric rate case so that we could implement interim rates in late 2012 to help offset the impact of increased property taxes, lower sales and added investments in Minnesota, however, based on our continued success, managing O&M expenses and with the help from warmer than normal weather in June and July, we decided to continue our plans which anticipate a Minnesota electric rate case filing in early November. So with that, I will turn the call over to Teresa.
Teresa Madden: Thanks, Ben and good morning. Today, I will discuss second quarter results, provide an update on our regulatory calendar, discuss our financing plan and update you on our 2012 earnings guidance. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter results at each of our four operating companies. Earnings at PSCo increased $0.05 per share for the second quarter, due primarily to an electric rate increase, effective in May 2012, lower O&M expenses and warmer June weather. The increases were partially offset by decreased wholesale revenue due to the exploration of a long-term power agreement with Black Hills Corporation. Earnings at NSP-Minnesota were flat for the quarter. SPS earnings increased $0.01 per share for the second quarter. New rate increases in New Mexico and Texas, effective in January 2012, were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and property taxes. Second quarter earnings at NSP-Wisconsin decreased $0.01 per share, due to higher O&M expenses, partially offset by rate increases effective in January 2012 and warmer summer weather. I will now discuss some of the key drivers that affected the income statement, beginning with the retail electric margin. Our second quarter electric margin increased $44 million. Primary drivers of the higher margin were $25 million from new rate increases in several states but most significantly in Colorado and $21 million from estimated impact of weather. These positive items were partially offset by lower firm's wholesale revenues due to the exploration of a long-term agreement with Black Hills Corporation and other less significant item. Our quarterly weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.5% having a negligible positive impact on electric margin. Year-to-date weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.004%. However, weather normalized sales actually declined 0.002% when you remove the benefit of one additional day of sales due to leap year. We continue to forecast flat sales growth for 2012. Turning to expenses. We continue to successfully manage O&M expenses in an effort to help offset some of the headwinds we faced in 2012. We began implementing O&M reduction initiatives in January to help offset the impact of the lower than forecasted sales, warm winter weather and the denial of our request for interim rates in Colorado. As a result of these efforts, our O&M expenses were essentially flat on both quarterly and year-to-date basis. We continue to forecast 2012 O&M expenses increase up to 1%. This compares to our original expectation for a 3% to 4% increase, however, continued warm weather may put upward pressure on our O&M targets. Other taxes increased approximately $7.1 million or 7.7% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota, following the denial of our deferred accounting request. As a reminder, we are deferring incremental property taxes in Colorado as a result of our recently approved multiyear plan. I will now provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. In June, NSP-Wisconsin filed a request to increase electric rates by $39.1 million or 6.7% and to increase natural gas rates by $5.3 million or 4.9%. New rates are expected to be effective in January 2013. The electric rate filing was based on a 2013 forecast test year, 10.4% ROE, and equity ratio of 52.5% and an averaged 2013 electric rate base of approximately $790 million. The natural gas request was solely due to a proposal to recover the initial costs associated with the environmental MGP cleanup in Ashland. A commission decision is anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2012. In June 2011, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission to increase South Dakota electric rates by $14.6 million, effective in 2012. The request was based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes, a return on equity of 11%, a rate base of $323 million and an equity ratio of 52.48%. In June 2012, the South Dakota Commission authorized a rate increase of approximately $8 million, based on an ROE of 9.25%, and equity ratio of 53% and full cost recovery for the Nobles Wind Project which had been a contested issue in the proceedings. We are clearly disappointed in the authorized ROE granted in South Dakota. Nevertheless, we will continue to seek improved returns and to that end we filed a 2012 electric rate case in South Dakota in late June, requesting a $19.4 million increase in electrical rate. The request is based on a 2011 historic test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes for 2012 and 2013, a 10.65% ROE, a 53% equity ratio and a rate base of about $370 million. We anticipate a commission ruling in late 2012 or early 2013 with rates effective in early 2013. One last rate related proceeding I want to mention is our request for approval of our investment in SmartGridCity in Colorado. As part of this 2010 electric rate case, PSCo requested recovery of the revenue requirements associated with our $45 million capital investments and $4 million of annual O&M costs incurred to develop and operate our SmartGrid project in Boulder. In early 2011, the Colorado Commission allowed partial recovery of the project, totaling approximately $28 million of the capital cost and all of the O&M costs. In December 2011, PSCo requested Commission approval for the recovery of the remaining capital investment in SmartGrid. A decision is expected in the third quarter of 2012. The decision will not change the terms of the multiyear plan but would provide assurance of future recovery of these costs. Looking ahead, we continue to consider plans to file several additional rate cases in the second half of 2012 including electric rate cases in North Dakota, Texas, New Mexico and our Colorado gas case. In addition, in November we plan to file an electric rate case in Minnesota based on 2013 test year. This would allow for the implementation of interim rates in January. We will then consider options for pursing a multiyear rate plan similar to what we achieved in Colorado. The Minnesota Commission is considering a process to establish parameters for such a plan and we intend to actively participate. I would now like to update you on our financing plans for the remainder of 2012. In July 2012, we entered into amended five-year credit agreements with a syndicate of banks, replacing the previous four-year credit agreement. The amended credit agreements have substantially the same terms and conditions, however, with an improvement in pricing and extension of maturity from March 2015 to July 2017. Our 2012 financing program continues as planned. During the second quarter, we issued $100 million of first mortgage bonds at SPS. This quarter, we plan to issue $800 million of first mortgage bonds at both NSP-Minnesota and PSCo. We also plan to issue approximately $100 million of first mortgage bonds at NSP-Wisconsin during the second half of the year. Financing plans are subject to change depending upon capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors. In a challenging year marked by warm winter weather, tepid electric sales and some regulatory decisions that worked against us, we are proud of our efforts designed to deliver 2012 EPS within our guidance range. Taking early measures to reduce O&M expense and securing approval of the multiyear plan in Colorado, demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver on our financial objective. Since 2005, we have established a strong track record and we remain committed to delivering 2012 earnings within our guidance range. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Security Research. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Security Research: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go a little more into the usage patterns that you are seeing on weather adjustment basis, the flat, and what you guys have booked so far in terms of usage growth. Which jurisdictions are you seeing more positive weather adjusted usage signs? Which more negative? Then to the extent that you might be seeing the DSM in conservation programs affecting that, do you think you are fully realizing the lost margin through those riders that you have?
Ben Fowke: Those are all great questions. Let me just try to answer your first question. I think the strongest sales that we are seeing are at SPS, based upon the energy related businesses they had down there. We are also seeing on the C&I sides, some pretty good pick up in Wisconsin. Again, that's energy-related, but in this case, it's more sand mining, which has really become quite the business in that part of Wisconsin. I think we are seeing some growth in the last quarter with PSCo and in Colorado. Again, I think that's primarily energy-related. Then when you move to Minnesota, it's been pretty sluggish across the board in both the C&I and residential class and, Travis, just as a broad stroke we are adding residential customers, but the residential usage is definitely less per household than it has been in the past So that's something we are watching very closely, and maybe that segues into your second part of your question, it was the impact of DSM. It's been pretty attractive for us, but we do believe that shades off 70, 80 basis points on our sales growth expectation, and I guess the thing that we continue to analyze is whether or not there's a shadow effect to that that perhaps we are not getting compensated for, but it's certainly in Minnesota, it's pushing us in the rate cases pretty quickly.
Travis Miller - Morningstar Security Research: Imagine that's one of the key issues I think coming up in November. You will address usage?
Ben Fowke: We have tend to miss forecast what sales are going to be. We have been too optimistic. So, we will have to make sure that we temper that optimism coming into this rate case.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: On the Minnesota regulatory process. Teresa, you mentioned the Commission is working on process that would give some clarity on how a multiyear plan would work. Is that how to think of it? Can you give us some color on that?
Teresa Madden: You are thinking of that correctly, and in fact they are going to have a preliminarily discussion about that today. So, that's exactly right. It's not just for us, but it's for all utilities.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: Would you expect that then they would give you some pretty specific ideas that well here you could file, say for a three-year rate deal, How should we think of what to expect from what they are doing now?
Teresa Madden: Well, Kit, it's early to say exactly what would come out of that. Our plan right now is to file the one-year and then pursue like we did in Colorado, ultimately a multiyear, potentially as just part of that as we move forward in that case.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: Any idea on when they would have some specifics on multiyear rate making?
Teresa Madden: Comments are due in October and we will just proceed through the process in the fourth quarter.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: Obviously that should be available some sort of feedback from the commission should be available before you file that rate case?
Teresa Madden: Could be, but our plans as I indicated Kit.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: In Colorado, I think the idea was when you got the three-year deal that and that would help you to manage to the revenue outlook that you saw then. Can you give us some idea of how the Colorado business is going in terms of achieving allowed our ROE and what the prospect for that is, going forward?
Teresa Madden: As you recall we have the 10% parameter and we will share above that but we are feeling good that this is going to provide sufficient revenue release in terms of meeting our objective.
Kit Konolige - BGC Financial: Great, thank you.
Teresa Madden: Thanks.
Ben Fowke: Kit. I guess I would add that all of our jurisdictions with the exception of Minnesota probably are going to be in the mid 9s ROE this year. Minnesota will not be in the 9s which is reason why we have filed in rate case. I think it's off the line.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: When you talk about managing your O&M cost and regionally thought that would be a 3% to 4% escalation, looking at 1% or so, how much of that is a permanent reduction in O&M? How much is sort of timing and temporary? How should we think about O&M going forward from an escalation perspective?
Teresa Madden: Ali, in terms of O&M, just in general, as we go through the year, we have variations, we move projects around. In terms of the longer term, we would expect to be more around 3% potentially 4% range increases. So, this year as we said 0% to 1% and we would expect to get back on track to 3% to 4% next year and in the future after that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Then secondly, could you remind us if you used 12 as a base in terms of your rate base currently across the portfolio and look at the CapEx that you have budgeted for the next four to five years, what's the underlying annualized rate base growth that CapEx is supporting starting from a 12 base?
Teresa Madden: Ali, it's less than seven around six or so.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: That is, Teresa, using 12 as a base, right?
Teresa Madden: Yes.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay, and last question Ben, you alluded to the fact you are going to be earning, mid 9% across every jurisdiction other than Minnesota, remind us what's embedded in for Minnesota this year and that's these are ROEs at the utility right, we are not talking any corporate leverage, et cetera on top of that?
Ben Fowke: I was talking about utility ROEs and then I think Minnesota will probably be in the 8% range. I mean, obviously losing $24 million in property tax hurts. Sales have been continued sluggish in Minnesota. So that's the reason why it's the laggard.
Teresa Madden: I would add to that Ali, at a consolidate basis we expect to see just slightly above 10%.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: But that's again at the corporate?
Teresa Madden: Yes.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: And, you have been talking about the lower end of the range, but you have also been talking about better weather et cetera, is there a scenario that you could actually go to the higher end of the range as the year progresses or is it given where we are, that's probably not realistic?
Ben Fowke: Ali, we have given you the best short of where we see it now. Clearly, July, we haven't closed the books on July, but weather has been favorable in July. We have some more regulatory proceedings to go through and we will keep watching the sales. So, I think we will be in good position to update you better in the third quarter, which is typically when we refine our estimates anyway because that's our earnings season. So, stay tuned.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Paul Fremont - Jeffries: First question I have is with South Dakota, what sort of drove their decision for that level of ROE and if South Dakota's coming in low, does that that have an effect on sort of the surrounding states and their way of thinking about ROE?
Ben Fowke: Well, I would just have to tell you, we totally disagree with the ROE that we were given and it pushes us right away to filing a rate case. Again, as Teresa mentioned, and, it's an historic test here, so you have got lag on top of that and it is disturbing to us. Clearly, we want to see it get better. If it doesn't get better, we will have to figure out what we were going to do going forward, because I mean your question is a good one, capital needs to go where it's being rewarded. Right now, I think it was unintentional signal, but I think the South Dakota Commission is saying, we don't want you to spend money on the infrastructure. That's certainly when you get that kind of return, that's what it's telling you.
Teresa Madden: We just to add in terms of your question about influencing our other jurisdictions which seems to be at that same level, obviously there is pressure on ROEs all over. Do we see that in Minnesota or North Dakota to that degree? Not to that degree, outside of just normal pressures on ROE.
Paul Fremont - Jeffries: Then I guess my second question is, how does the Minnesota decision on the tax recovery impact your strategy for future settlements? Because obviously under the settlement, the parties I think were amenable to allowing you to recovery those costs, but you still got shot down by the commission, so I mean does that make it more difficult to settle?
Ben Fowke: Well, the staff didn't sign-off on that. So ideally we would have staff sign-off. So, we will have to work harder on that going forward. Settlements still make a lot of sense. We did that in Colorado and we will continue to try to do things like that in Minnesota, but we were clearly disappointed.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: Just going back to the Minnesota comments and kind of in the nature of a slower growth environment, what elements do you think can be most important to get it a multiyear structure done as you lay out a plan with the commission?
Ben Fowke: Well, the benefits of a multiyear plan from a customer perspective is certainty. It’s just a great opportunity to talk about the infrastructure refresh challenge, the need for that, lay that out with stakeholders, get them to understand and have them understand what the rate impact is to them and I don't think that goes away in a low sales environment or high sales environment. I just like the transparency. Now on our end, clearly when we know what our revenues is going to be in the next three years, I think it positions you better to manage your O&M, manage your capital budgets and manage through your revenue expectations. So I think it works for both. Hopefully that answers your question. Does it?
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: I guess you had a long lines of of what sort of your mechanisms you think need to be in place as far as kind of revenue protection at the lower volume to offset the higher rate of O&M cost inflation and property tax and things like that?
Ben Fowke: There are so many other things there are give and takes, if you can agree on what the sales are going to be, one of the things you could do is have some kind of true-up mechanism may be a band like we did down in Colorado where if it gets at roads pass a certain point or we don't achieve a certain point, you have some kind of mechanism if it’s extreme. That’s part of the settlement process but typically if both parties see it differently. There’s an opportunity to compromise on some mechanism that doesn’t create a windfall or hurt anybody.
Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse: I guess one other questions is on transmission investment, what opportunities are you guys have seen within the region as the EPA rules come into effect and we expects to see more coal plant retirement announcement in MISOs that open more windows of those spending from what’s in the plan right now?
Ben Fowke: I don't know if it’s going to do that much through transmission, the retirements. To answer your question, the opportunities for transmission investment are enormous in all of our territories and the upper Midwest is no exception. It happens to be where we are further along in the development of those plants and we are going to spend, what is it Teresa, close to $4 billion over the next five years?
Teresa Madden: Right, that's correct, out of our $13 billion budget. So it's a pretty robust budget right now.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Michael Bates with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson: On your guidance, as you talk about the rider revenue expected to be $35 million to $45 million higher than last year, do you have the number as far as where you're at mid-year?
Ben Fowke: Michael, can you restate the question? You were breaking up a little bit there?
Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson: Sure. I was wondering, in your guidance you assumed that rider recovery is $35 million to $45 million higher than it was in 2011. I'm wondering do you have the number to kind of show us where you are at mid-year?
Teresa Madden: Well, I would say we are on track. The biggest variation in terms of the variance is due to the PSIA, the new rider in Colorado related to gas infrastructure investment. So, nothing different in terms of our assumptions from prior quarters around that, so we are not seeing any necessary updates from where we have been.
Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson: Then going back to your comments on the Brush Power assets and I am sorry if I missed this earlier, but when do you expect to put those into PSCo's rate base?
Ben Fowke: We expect the transaction to close in the early part of next year.
Michael Bates - D.A. Davidson: You would expect it to immediately go into the retail rate base then upon closing?
Ben Fowke: Typically, remember, it's under a PPA right now. So embedded in our rates right now is the capacity recovery.
Operator: Thank you and there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Teresa for any closing comments.
Teresa Madden: I want to thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, Paul Johnson and the IR team are available to take your calls. Thanks.

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, April 26, 2012. I will now like to turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Management. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy’s First Quarter 2012 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. This morning we’ll provide you with an update on recent business development, discuss first quarter results, review our 2012 earnings guidance, highlight our strong corporate governance and take your questions. As a reminder, there are slides that accompany today’s call which are available on our web page. In addition some of the comments we make will contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Thank you, and good morning. Today we’ve reported first quarter earnings of $0.38 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2011. I’m sure you’re aware that weather was significantly warmer this quarter, and that had an adverse impact on our results. However, we’ve initiated actions to help offset the impact of warmer weather and lower than forecasted at electric sale. As a result of our efforts, quarterly O&M expenses came in roughly flat with last year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect 2012 earnings to be in the lower half of our earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Now Teresa will discuss our quarterly results and earnings guidance in greater detail in a few moments. I’ll now provide you with few updates, beginning with the review of our regulatory development. In Minnesota, we are pleased that the Commission approved our rate case settlement at the end of March. The annual rate increases of $58 million in 2011; $15 million in 2012 are based on 10.37 ROE. This settlement also includes a $30 million reduction through depreciation expense. As part of the settlement in the Minnesota Electric case, the settling parties recognized that NSP Minnesota would follow up the decision sticking deferred accounting for 2012 property tax expense above the level approved in a rate case. In December, we filed the petition requesting a deferral of incremental 2012 property taxes, which are currently estimated at $24 million. In April, the Department of Commerce recommended that the commission denied the request. However, a coalition of large industrial customers and the Chamber Of Commerce were supportive of our deferred accounting request. Our earnings guidance reflects the assumption that we are able to defer incremental property taxes in Minnesota. We believe we’ve met their criteria for deferred accounting treatment. Last week, we filed our response to the department’s concern, which provide strong support for our request. We expect the Minnesota PUC to rule on this request during the second quarter. In Colorado, we arrived at a comprehensive multi-year rate settlement agreement with the PUC staff, the office of consumer counsel and several other intervenors. The agreement reflects a 73 million electric rate increase in 2012; an incremental $16 million increase in 2013; and a $25 million increase in 2014, based on a 10% ROE and a 56% equity ratio. In addition, the settlement enables us to defer incremental property taxes. We believe this is a constructive settlement that provides revenue and regulatory certainty for both our customers and our shareholders, while establishing a regulatory framework for a multi-year plan. Hearings were held on Tuesday, and the commission is deliberating on the settlement this morning, and may rule later today. Turning our focus to 2013; in June we plan to file an electric and natural gas case in Wisconsin. During the second half of the year, we plan to file several cases, including electric cases in Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota. Finally, we plan to file an electric case in Minnesota, where we are anticipating pursuing a multi-year plan. Together these cases will drive earnings in 2013. One final regulatory item. In March, we asked the Minnesota Commission to reaffirm that increasing generating capacity at our Prairie Island nuclear plant within our customer’s best interest. We are seeking a reaffirmation as much as change since the Commission issued a certificate of need for the Prairie Island operate in 2009. Key changes since 2009 include a more lengthy approval process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, less expected incremental output from the plant to operate, higher project costs, lower natural gas prices, as well as lower demand growth. When circumstances change significantly after an initial regulatory approval as with this project, our approach is to step back and take another look before continuing. It’s prudent to have this review now rather than after completing the project. This is consistent with our focus on stake holder alignment. We anticipate the Minnesota PUC will rule on this request later this year or early next. We also continue to make good progress implementing our transmission strategy. Notably, the Minnesota Commission granted the last siting and routing permit needed for the CapX2020 lines in Minnesota. The right of first refusal bill was signed into law in Minnesota. We began phase II of the Fargo-St. Cloud line and the construction of the Brookings Hampton line and in Texas we reached a settlement for the route of the Tuco-Woodward line. Clearly, our transmission projects remain on track. Next, I’d like to provide you a brief environmental update. During the last year, EPA continue to pursue its regulatory agenda, which significantly raises the bar for environmental compliance. In most cases, our proactive environmental strategy has dramatically reduced our cost of compliance with EPA’s new mandate. For example, in late 2011, EPA finalized its Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule. But we’ll have to make some emission control investments under this rule; our cost of compliant is lower than the rest of the industry, primarily because of the actions we implemented over the last decade. EPA also proposed to approve, our regional haze plan for Colorado this year. That plan incorporates our Clean Air Clean Jobs emission reduction program, a plan which mitigates the cost of EPA regulations for our customers. As a result of our proactive environmental action, Xcel Energy is well positioned to meet various environmental challenges over the next decade. We believe our customers and shareholders had benefited from these actions. The biggest environmental challenge we’re currently facing is EPA’s CSAPR rule. Because of its short compliance window, CSAPR was unusual and that it had a significant impact on Xcel Energy and our customer. As a result, we joined other utilities in several states in challenging the rule and seeking its stay. Late last year, the Court of Appeal stayed the rule, while it continue to consider the merits of our challenge. Last month the court listened to arguments over the legality of the rule. We expect the ruling sometime this summer and remain optimistic that this litigation will result in better environmental regulation. Clearly, public policy will continue to impact our capital spend. Our five-year capital forecast includes approximately $470 million for CSAPR compliance; and $300 million for the Prairie Island upgrade. The changes in timing or compliance with CSAPR as well as the Minnesota Commission’s decision on the upgrade to Prairie Island could potentially reduce our capital forecast. If these projects are modified or canceled, we still project strong rate-based growth over the next five years. In addition, a reduction in our capital forecast would reduce our financing requirement, and provide us with increased flexibility. One final comment before I turn the call over to Teresa. The continued low price of natural gas is a hot topic for our industry. With deal closes or recovery mechanisms in all of our states, low natural gas prices are very beneficial for our customer and for Xcel Energy. This is especially true as we investments to modernize our systems. Our customers see lower bills, and a lower share of their income is spent on energy consumption. While we make investments in our system to provide our customers with long term value, our mission is to provide our customer with clean, safe, reliable energy at a competitive price. Lower fuel prices certainly help us achieve that mission. Tune it over to Teresa.
Teresa S. Madden: Thanks, Ben, and good morning. Today I will discuss first quarter results, 2012 earnings guidance and a shareholder proposal included in this year’s proxy. Let’s begin by reviewing our first quarter results at each of our four operating companies. As Ben indicated, warm weather throughout our service territory negatively impacted our first quarter results, mostly notably in Minnesota, which experienced the warmest March in over 100 year. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.01 per share due to lower sales as result of the warmer weather, decreased wholesale revenue due to the expiration of the Black Hills contract, higher depreciation and interest expense partially offset by higher gas revenues, resulting from new rates that were effective in September 2011. At NSP Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.03 per share due to weather, final rates which were lower than interim rates last year, higher property taxes and higher O&M expenses. These negative drivers were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, which I’ll discuss in a few moments. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin and SPS were both flat for the quarter. Quarterly results at both companies were positively impacted by new rates effective in January 2012, offset primarily by the negative impact of weather. Let’s take a closer look at the drivers that affected various line items in the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin decreased by $25 million, primary drivers of the reduced margins were $22 million from the estimated impact of weather and $11 million from lower firm wholesale revenue largely driven by the expiration of the Black Hills contract. These negative items were partially offset by higher transmission revenue, retail rate increases in several states and other smaller items. Weather normalized retail electric sales grew 0.3%, and had a negligible impact on electric margin. However, this modest increase included the benefit of an extra day of sales due to leap year, without the extra day the first quarter electric sales declined eight tenths of 1%. We might recall that our fourth quarter sales were also slightly negative. This is a disappointing trend, and as a result, we now expect our weather adjusted annual sales growth to be flat for 2010. Natural gas margins decreased by $19 million in the first quarter, primarily due to warm winter weather which reduced margins by $21 million. Turning to expenses, first quarter O&M expenses were essentially flat for the quarter. In January, we began a comprehensive review of our O&M expenses with a goal of not compromising reliability or customer service. We were able to implement several initiatives such as deferring merit increases for non-bargaining employees, reducing incentive company accrual, corresponding new hires, cutting training and other items to offset the impact of lower than forecasted sales and warm weather. As a result of these actions, we now expect O&M expenses to increase between 0% and 1% for the year. Previously, our guidance reflected an annual O&M increase of 3% to 4%. Other taxes increased approximately $9.1 million or 9.4% largely due to increased property taxes in Minnesota. As Ben discussed, we’ve requested deferral of incremental property taxes in Minnesota for 2012. However, we’ll continue to expense the incremental property taxes until the Minnesota Commission rules on this issue. If our request is approved, we would retroactively defer these incremental property taxes for the beginning of the year. You may have noticed, we have an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. We expect this tax rate was primarily due to the recent completion of a tax planning analysis regarding the eligibility of certain expenses that qualify for an extended carry back. As a result of the differential between a higher tax rate in prior years and the current tax rate, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the first quarter. As a result of this tax benefit, we’ve adjusted our projected effective tax rate for 2012 to a range of 34% to 35%. This has been a challenging year for us, very warm winter weather and declining normalized sale. However, we’ve taken steps to at least partially offset these impacts by managing O&M expenses and implementing a tax planning strategy. Clearly, we still have a lot of work to do. With our management action, normal weather the rest of the year and assumed constructed outcomes in our regulatory proceedings, including commission approval of our settlement agreement in Colorado, and our deferred property tax request in Minnesota, we continue to expect to deliver earnings in the lower half our guidance range, of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Before we open up the call for your questions, I’d like to draw your attention briefly to this year’s proxy statement, which includes the shareholder proposal for Xcel Energy to adopt the policy or the Chairman of the company would be an Independent Director. Our Board of Directors recommend a vote against this proposal. Xcel Energy has demonstrated sound corporate governance trends for many years, including annual election of Directors, and independent non-employee Directors among its 11 members, an annual election of a lead Independent Director. Board committee is composed entirely of Independent Directors and Committee Chairs review and approve agendas for Committee meeting. These practices have served our shareholders well. Xcel Energy has consistently delivered on its operational and financial objectives. A strong track record is reflected and [achievement] of total return to shareholders that exceeded our peer group of the EEI investor owned electric and the S&P 500 Index for the 5 year period ending December 2011. The board believes that it is in the best position to evaluate the current and future needs of the company and to judge how the capabilities of the company’s Directors and Executives can collectively be most effective in meeting those needs. The Board believes that maintaining flexibility to decide the appropriate leadership structure of the Board is consistent with effective governance by serving the shareholders’ interest and that this proposal would deprive the Board and its ability to govern the company in the manner it seems most effective. We request that you consider these factors as you vote your proxy in the coming weeks. For more details, I urge you to review the Board’s response to this shareholder proposal in our proxy statement. If you have any questions or comments regarding the content of this year’s proxy, please contact our IR team. That concludes my prepared remarks, operator we will now take questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller – Morningstar: Thanks, good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Hey, Travis.
Teresa S. Madden:  Good morning. 
Travis Miller – Morningstar: I wanted to go to Minnesota here for a little bit. If you get that property tax deferral there, do you think you can earn the allowed return of 10.37 in 2012, and corollary there, is that embedded in your guidance weather normalized?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: The deferral of the property tax is embedded in our guidance, and the reality is, Travis, even with that deferral, the accounting order for the deferral of property taxes, we want to earn the allowed return of 10.37, I think we anticipate NSP Minnesota would probably be in the low 9.
Travis Miller – Morningstar: What’s the biggest thing driving that, is the capital side or the operating cost side?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Well, I mean it’s this erosion of sales that we’ve seen in Minnesota which is probably the most pronounced in all of our jurisdiction. This is really the – essentially the second year of staying out or a rate case, and so there is a number of factors like that, that will push that down.
Teresa S. Madden: Ben, I’d just add to that, greatest impact of our weather is in the Minnesota company. So…
Travis Miller – Morningstar: And then third on that, what risks you see if you file in November. Do you expect based on the negotiations from the previous year, though the risk I’m thinking of in ROE come potentially from even 10.37, disallowance of some kind of operating costs, disallowance of potential capital costs, what are the key risks based on settlement negotiations et cetera from previous case that could go into the November ’12 base?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: I mean, I think the issues that you raised were always the issues when you ever could follow rate case. I mean, so I would probably say that the ROE would always have to – and it’s one of the key things we defend. Our capital, Travis, tends to be a much easier sell, particularly because it’s pretty easy to see the value of that return. I mean this is a year, again, I want to talk about on the call, but we’re starting the year off very strongly with reliability and all the operating indicators that are so important to our customers. And it’s really a reflection of the money we can put in into our system. So at the end of the day, I mean, it’s litigated, it’s as interveners, let’s see it another way, but I think at the end of the day, we’ve got a track record that demonstrates that, we get constructive outcomes. And I think one of the advantage of going to a multi-year plan, like we did in Colorado, is we get that regulatory certainty, and we get a little pause. I mean, I think we have recognized that when you modernize an infrastructure, you follow a lot of rate cases. So, I think it'd be nice to get a multiyear plan or something close to it and kind of get our marching orders and move on with it. 
Travis Miller – Morningstar: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. Good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Hi, Ali.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hi, how are you?
Teresa S. Madden: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning, Teresa. Ben, if you look at Colorado, and assuming you do get the settlement approved, at least in Colorado should we assume that that gives you the tools to earn your authorized returns or are there still going to be lag there as well?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Well, Ali, there will still will be some lag. I mean, but I think we will close it a bit and I think we have a little more control of our destiny. And, I mean, Ali we didn't get everything we wanted and then, that's kind of the way it goes when you do a settled agreement, but I think we made a lot of progress, we set the precedent going forward for multi-year plans. And I think if we manage expenses and capital in our business well that we can help eliminate some of that lag that plagued us in Colorado, but we won't cut it out completely by any stretch.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And, I mean, along those lines if you look at your two biggest jurisdictions Minnesota and Colorado, you are looking at multi-year plans, you get into run rate increases you got that in Minnesota as well. From a logistic point of view, is that a particular functional change that is still required in both of those jurisdictions to be able to earn an authorized ROE, what needs to – in broad terms, what big item needs to change for you to eliminate the lags in Minnesota and Colorado?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Well, I mean, it will help us to bounce back. I mean, that would be one thing that helps in between rate cases. Ali, it’s some of the expenses that we've had, the pension amortization which hopefully starts to level-off, I think in 2013 and beyond that will help and I mean as we start to – as our capital forecast starts to flatten-out, albeit at a relatively higher amount than we have seen historically, I think that will be helpful too. I don't know, Teresa, if you want to add anything?
Teresa S. Madden: I think you have covered the major items. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And last question, looking more near-term…
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Ali, can I just…
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Yes never mind.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Never obviously add something, but I will take it back. Go ahead.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, I just want to say, near-term, when you look at the trends that you reported in the first quarter, including the tax benefit, was that sort of plugged in to your budget for the year? In other words, was Q1 pretty much on track, because if you took the tax benefit out, that’s about $0.03 swing right there? So just wondering, was that a positive offset to some other slowdown or how should we be thinking about that in the context of your own budget?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: I guess, let me start it out and I’ll have Teresa add. I mean the plan here – we knew we are planning around this tax benefit. The question was going to be what quarter we would take it in and which is why we don’t do quarterly guidance. So, it was always in our guidance range of $1.75 to $1.85 and we knew we had that when we talked about it. So, as far as the timing of it, I think that’s a function of when the planning was completed and some things like that. Teresa, I don’t know if you want to add anything.
Teresa S. Madden: I mean, you’re exactly right, Ben. I mean we had assumed a certain level in terms of the tax planning strategy. We actually completed the work at the end of the first quarter. Obviously, we consulted with our auditors about different methodology, the approach, and the amount, and including the timing, and in fact, we determined it was most appropriate to recognize it in the first quarter. So, again, short answer is, yes, we had assumed a level in our guidance, and in the quarterly estimates, there was some variability in that.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  But earlier today you called out that you’re budgeting a 34% to 35% effective tax rate for the year. Remind me was that not the original plan or is it down from what your original plan was for the tax rate for the year?
Teresa S. Madden:  It's down, it was 34% to 36% originally and which is now at 34% to 35%.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Keep in mind, Ali we expected that this would possibly come in, but weren't necessarily sure on the timing and the ultimate magnitude of it.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Got it, got it, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crudel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Anthony Crudel – Jefferies:  Hey, good morning. Some questions mainly related to Minnesota and I guess the regulatory environment. You guys plan to file, I guess latter this year, rate case and when you see how sales and also weather had impacted you guys. Is there a potential for I don't know even if it's allowed for like revenue decoupling or something like that in Minnesota? And the second question is, what type of premium does the regulators in Minnesota historically have given for a multiyear rate plan?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  I don't think there's ever been a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota. So, this would be groundbreaking. And, what was the first part of your question, I'm sorry?
Anthony Crudel – Jefferies: First question was, is there any ability to get some revenue decoupling or somehow you guys you’re so impacted by either weather or just flat sales if there is some way that you could be made hold for a stuff like that? 
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: I mean that’s always something – that’s a conversation that potentially we could have, but there's a lot of trade-offs with that and then there's a lot of devil in the details with those sorts of things. So I think we need to continue to evaluate that. There’s others ways that I think accomplish something close to that – that maybe aren’t as dramatic. But we’ll keep looking at all the adoption.
George E. Tyson II: And Anthony just a point to well we haven't implemented a multiyear rate plan in Minnesota. We have done step increases which is eventually a two-year rate increase. We've done that both in Minnesota, North Dakota and Texas in the last year so that progress towards that multiyear plan.
Anthony Crudel – Jefferies: It just seems that with flat sales or declining sales, and I know you're getting your step-up increases, but it's tough to have a stay-out of longer than a year, maybe two, just because there's really no incentive where I think you have to say a premium return or some type of premium, like a 50 basis point premium, maybe this as an incentive to book something longer than a year, but to put these sales, it just seems that you're going to always going to earn. Is that a right rate of this situation or no?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  It depends how big the step increases are and what sales forecast is embedded on that and what kind of exit you have. We do have for example in Colorado, some exit ramps, albeit they are not without their pain, but that's the benefit I think, that's the trade-off and along with that goes with the benefits for multiyear plan. So hopefully, you get your three year plan right, and you've got some true-up mechanisms and other things that such things are maybe outside of your control.
Teresa S. Madden: Maybe just to add to that in terms of the Minnesota sales, the compression we’ve seen has really to spend in the last two quarters and its two quarter the trend potentially, but we’re continuing to watch that. So it’s maybe a little bit early for that larger bit. As Ben said, that's why we're looking at alternatives.
Anthony Crudel – Jefferies: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Hi, good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Hi, Dan.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  I have some questions related around the regulatory issues and rate cases as well. First on Minnesota, you mentioned part of the impact in the first quarter was due to the approved rates being lower than the interim rates a year ago. And I was wondering, how do you, I guess flow through that over recovery will that be over 12 months or how is that done just mechanically. How should we expect that to impact the year-over-year in comparison?
Teresa S. Madden: Well, when we were collecting early on the interim rate, we set up the revenue subject to refund and in essence those are – we've had all the true-up relative to the income statement, so they are not being given back to the customers. So we will not see any more income statement impact from that revenue subject to refund.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  It's really, Dan, just the timing of the quarter, first quarter this year to first quarter last year because in first quarter 2011 we were recording at the higher interim rate level, subsequent to that that Teresa mentioned we made adjustments to recognize that.
Teresa S. Madden: And really why we were recording, we were recording at the ROE of 10.88 and the big driver down was 10.37. So…
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. I noticed that you also had similar outcome in North Dakota will that have any impact?
Teresa S. Madden: No.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. And then I just want to verify. I think you said that you expect later this year you are going file electric cases to just say Texas, New Mexico, and Minnesota were those the ones you said?
Teresa S. Madden: Correct.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Yeah.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  What about the gas case in Minnesota, what was your ROE there, especially given the weak weather related sales and what's your plan for gas rates in Minnesota?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Dan, are you talking about our regulated 2011 return for our gas utility?
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Right.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: We don't file that until next week with the regulators.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. You didn't mention anything about gas do you have plans at all that you might be filing?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: We'll evaluate our gas business. I mean keep in mind, Dan, if you have warm, mild winter weather, it doesn't impact your revenue requirements when you file a rate case, because it's normalized. So, you're absolutely right that our gas operations will be under-earning more than we anticipated because of the weather, but there's a number of other factors we have to consider before we file a rate case.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. And then I was a little curious in your write-up about the rate case in South Dakota. You mentioned the staff actually lowered the cost of debt, which is usually an embedded cost. What there a new issue or something that wasn't incorporated that they included that would cause them to lower the cost of debt?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Dan, I think you stumped the team. I suspect it has to do with capitalization of short-term and long-term and some other capital ratios, but we’ll probably have to take that offline and get back to you.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, and then I was curious, once you take out the effect of the leap day, the commercial and industrial sales were down almost a percent, weather normalized, I was just wondering if you can give a little more color on what you are seeing since those sales typically aren’t as impacted by weather and what’s going on with your business customers?
Teresa S. Madden: In terms of – I would say for our large industrial customers in Minnesota and one of our large industrial customers is a paper mill and they’ve discounted a line of paper, they closed the board facility. So you are right, they are no impacted by weather, then we’re just seeing some in their business, business plans changed. In Colorado our big customers are pretty much dismoderating, as they have been. We are not seeing big increases, but we are not seeing decreases either.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  The biggest decreases are in this small C&I and the residential and that's really across almost all of our jurisdictions, it's most grounds here in Minnesota. It is a bit perplexing Dan because I mean if you look at the unemployment rates, job growth, et cetera we typically in all of our jurisdictions but we typically do a bit better than the national average. So, I mean, it could be a number of factors that we're trying to analyze that are causing this trend. One of which might be more shadow effect of our own demand and conservation programs which we know probably take-off about 0.008% of sales and we're compensated for that, but maybe there's more of an impact than we realized. I think the economy continues to impact customer behavior and then we're also looking at things like we're starting to see appliances get refreshed and maybe seeing some efficiencies there that perhaps we don't have our full handle on. So there’s a lot of things that we're looking at right now.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay. Then the last one I had was just related to, you mentioned that PS Colorado, the impact from loosing the, or expiration of that wholesale contract Black Hills. Is that going to be continuing year-over-year negative for the rest of this year, when did that contract expire?
Teresa S. Madden:  That contract expired at the end of the year, but we needed to shift from a cost recovery from wholesale to retail customers and that is incorporating in our Colorado settlement. So assuming we get new rates, the 1st of March and that will cover that.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: That's first of May
Teresa S. Madden:  Excuse me, May, sorry.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: That reminded me, so you mentioned that you had a comprehensive settlement with multi-party are there, what parties are not part of that settlement or are there any disputed issues that...
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: In Colorado?
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Right.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: All the major interveners signed off on it, Dan you always get a few outliers that won't but Dan again, we expect to have a decision out of the Commission today, potentially it already happened. So we should have full clarity on that very shortly.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. Well, thank you.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Timothy Yee with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning, just to be clear on that, just to be clear on the Minnesota property tax proposal; relative to your guidance, do you think you would still have additional room to find offsets if the deferred property tax in Minnesota is not granted?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: We said in the call, I think in the absence of the Commission not giving the $24 million, it’s a pretty big hit to overcome. So I don’t think we could get it without sacrificing things that we won’t sacrifice as far as maintenance of the system. So it would be tough. Now that said, there’s always backup plans and we could ask for reconsideration or we can consider filing our planned rate case in Minnesota early. Those aren’t the preferred routes, obviously.
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Okay, fair enough. And just one other question regarding the updated earning guidance assumptions, were there any changes to your CapEx this year kind of driving the lower depreciation expense and the lower AFUDC equity or is that kind of more a function of the expected regulatory outcome?
Teresa S. Madden: We haven’t had any changes yet in terms of our CapEx this year, and while it’s a very small increase, remember in the Minnesota case, we agreed to a $30 million annual reduction in our depreciation expense. So, we’re seeing that reflected in this period, the first quarter’s expense.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: It also reflects updates and in-service dates and timings and things like that, that have impact those lines.
Operator:  Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I’d like to turn the call back over to Teresa for closing remarks.
Teresa S. Madden: I want to thank you all for participating in our first quarter earnings call this morning and if you have any follow-up questions, Paul Johnson and our IR team are available to take your call. So thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We’d like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode and following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Management. Please go ahead.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s year-end 2011 earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today, we’ll discuss our 2011 results, provide you with the recent business and regulatory developments and review our 2012 earnings guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call and are available on our web page.  Before we begin, let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Thanks Paul and good morning. I’m pleased to announce that Xcel Energy enjoyed another successful year. I’ll review some of the highlights from 2011 and also comment on some of the challenges we face in 2012. Teresa will then discuss our 2011 results in greater detail. As you probably read in this morning’s press release, we reported 2011 earnings of $1.72 per share, compared with $1.62 per share in 2010, representing a 6% increase. We feel good about delivering earnings results in the upper half of our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. This marks the seventh consecutive year that we have met or exceeded our annual earnings objective. We were also successful in meeting our other financial objectives. We raised an annual dividend of $0.03 per share or 3% to $1.04 per share and we maintained our strong credit ratings. Continuing to meet our financial objectives is certainly important; however, I’m equally proud that we delivered a high level of system reliability in a year that clearly presented us with some weather related challenges.  In addition to our hot summer throughout our service territory, we experienced some rather noteworthy storms in 2011, including a tornado in a densely populated Minneapolis neighborhood and early season snowstorms in the Denver area. All of these storms resulted in significant damage and widespread power outages. I commend our employees for how rapidly and thoroughly they responded to these challenging events, restoring service in all situations in record time. Delivering value to our customers has led to a record customer satisfaction rating of 93% in 2011, slightly above the 92% rating we received in 2009 and 2010.  We had some significant operational successes in 2011 that should position us to continue to provide a high level of service to our customers for many years to come. To name a few, the NRC renewed the operating license for our Prairie Island plants, authorizing the units to generate emission free base load generation for another 20 years.  In Texas we put the Jones 3 combustion turbine into service one year early and substantially under budget. At NSP, the MISO Board approved multi value project status for the Brookings Hampton line with the projected investment by Xcel Energy of $480 million and we had the first segments of SB100, Power for the Plains and the CapX2020 transmission projects, which totaled over 180 miles going to service.  In addition, Xcel Energy was named to the 2011-2012 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. This is the fifth year we earned a place in the Index, which includes companies considered to be best in class in terms of economic, environmental and social performance. Xcel Energy also ranked second at a 2,500 publicly traded companies on Trust Across America’s 2011 list of Most Trustworthy Companies in the United States.  Another positive event occurred in late 2011 when the D.C. Circuit Court suspended the order on CSAPR. This is great news for our customers, particularly in Texas. The unexpected inclusion of Texas under CSAPR created significant issues for SPS. With limited options to comply by 2012, our plan was to alter the dispatching of our plants in Texas by simultaneously reducing the energy output of our coal plants, while increasing the operation of our natural gas plants.  This stay allows us to defer the rules significant cost increases and potential reliability problems, which would have affected our customers SPS. We are hopeful that the court’s decision on the merits of the rule expected later this year, will enable us to comply in a more reasonable, cost effective manner.  Our five-year capital forecast includes about $470 million for CSAPR. While it’s possible the timing and the total investment may change, we don’t plan to revise our forecast until there’s more clarity surrounding the court’s final determination on the rule.  So 2011 was a good year. Unfortunately 2012 is not beginning as we had anticipated. As we noted in mid-January, the Colorado’s Commissions decision to deny our request for interim rate increase of $100 million poses a challenge for us as we start the year. In addition, our fourth quarter weather normalized electric sales declined slightly, something we haven’t experienced since 2009. As a result, our annual weather adjusted sales growth was only six-tenth of a percent in 2011. This leads us to believe that sales growth in 2012 could potentially be weaker than we originally forecasted.  Compounding the negative sales trend, the winter has been relatively mild thus far. We estimate that the mild weather in January will reduce first quarter earnings by approximately $0.02 per share.  Finally, we received our property tax statements in December and they were higher than we anticipated for both 2011 and 2012. The combination of these factors creates some headwinds for us. Fortunately it’s early in the year, so we have time to take action and we are.  While we are facing some challenges as we begin 2012, I believe our long-term prospects remain very favorable. Specifically, I believe the recent setback in Colorado is not indicative of an erosion in the regulatory compact. While the Colorado Commission did not authorize interim rates, they did approve an accounting order that will allow us to establish a regulatory asset to offset the impact of the expiration of the Black Hills contract. This decision represents about $0.02 per share to our projected 2012 earnings.  Additionally, we are implementing actions to reduce O&M expenses, which are expected to partially offset the impact of the headwinds I mentioned. We’ve established a solid track record of delivering on our financial objectives and we intend to do so in 2012.  Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Teresa Madden.
Teresa Madden: Thanks Ben and good morning. Today I will discuss our year-end results, pending rate cases and 2012 earnings guidance. Let’s begin with a review of 2011 results at each of our operating companies.  PSCo earnings decreased $0.04 per share for the year. The decrease is due to the implementation of seasonal rates in June 2010, higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by the impact of warmer weather last summer.  At NSP-Minnesota, earnings increased $0.13 per share, largely due to interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation and property taxes.  Earnings at SPS increased $0.01 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by record-breaking hot summer weather. These positive items were also partially offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense.  Finally, 2011 NSP Wisconsin earnings increased $0.01 per share. The positive impact of new electric rates was partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense.  I will now discuss some of the primary drivers on the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. In 2011, retail electric margin increased by $334 million. Significant drivers include a $102 million increase from interim and finance rates in multiple states, $124 million increase in revenue requirements reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado in late 2010.  This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing costs associated with these facilities. Finally, we met or exceeded our conservation in DSM targets, which resulted in a $45 million increase from higher conservation and DSM revenue and incentives.  For the year, natural gas margin increased by a modest $28 million, driven primarily by conservation and DSM revenue, as well as weather.  Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and natural gas margins were increases in a few expense categories. O&M expenses increased $83 million or 4%, largely driven by increased plant generation, labor and employee benefit cost. Our O&M expenses came largely in line with our expectations for the year.  Depreciation expense also offset some of the improvement in margins, increasing $32 million or 3.7%. The increase was driven by incremental capital investments representing an additional 1,800 megawatts of generation, including several larger projects that went into service such as a portion of the Monticello nuclear power upgrade come into Q3, the Minnesota Nobles wind project, two natural gas plants in Colorado that we acquired from Calpine and our SPS Jones 3 Unit addition.  However, the annual increase in depreciation expense was reduced by $30 million due to deprecation life changes agreed to in the settlement with various parties and the pending Minnesota Electric rate case.  As Ben mentioned, we experienced higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, which led to a $43 million or 12.9% increase in taxes other than income.  Last year was another busy and largely constructive year for us on the regulatory front. In addition to completing several rate cases that I will detail in a few moments, it’s also important to recognize some new mechanisms were approved that are designed to reduce regulatory lag.  For example; in Colorado, we received approval for a new rider towards the cover cost associated with the Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Management Program. In Texas, we received legislative approval to implement a distribution rider and in Minnesota we gained legislative approval for a multiyear rate plan.  I will now touch on some of our recently completed rate cases. In December, the New Mexico Commission approved our settlement agreement to increase electric rates by $13.5 million effective in January 2012. In Wisconsin, the Commission approved a $12.2 million electric rate increase and a $2.9 million natural gas increase, both effective last month.  We reached settlement agreements in our Minnesota and North Dakota electric rate cases last year and expect decisions by the respective commissions during the first quarter of 2012. As you might remember, interim rates for both states were effective in January 2011 and settlement agreements include step increases in 2012.  In South Dakota, we implemented an interim rate increase of $12.7 million last month. We continue to anticipate that the commission will decide this case in the first half of the year.  We’ll continue to pursue constructive regulatory outcomes in 2012. Of course, our pending Colorado electric case will be of great significance during the first half of the year. We’ve requested a $142 million increase and anticipate that final rates will be effective in the July-August timeframe. We are optimistic that the Commission will support the use of the forecast test year, which our request is based upon. In addition, we continue to explore the potential of multi-year rate plans with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be achieved through a settlement.  Other expected rate cases to be filed in 2012 include a 2013 Wisconsin rate case, and in Minnesota we continue to proceed with plans to file a 2013 electric case in November. This request may include a multi-year plan. Finally, we will consider filing rate cases in some of our other jurisdictions.  Turning to our outlook for 2012, Ben already highlighted some of the challenges. I’ll reiterate; it’s early in the year and we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the decision by the Colorado Commission to deny our interim rate request. As a result we now forecast 2012 earnings per share to be in the lower half of the $1.75 to $1.85 range.  Achieving 2012 earnings in the lower half of the range would be consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective. Using 2009 as the base year, the lower half of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% to 6% compound and earnings growth.  Certain events entering 2012 were unique. Looking ahead, you shouldn’t anticipate that we will provide future quarterly updates or color regarding where we expect to end up in the guidance range.  As noted in today’s release, we’ve updated some of the guidance assumptions. We lowered our expected increase in O&M expenses to reflect the management actions we have implemented. We also added an assumption related to the increase in property taxes. It’s important to recognize that we requested a deferral of the 2012 increase in property taxes in Minnesota, consistent with our settlement in the rate case. The guidance range assumes a favorable outcome with respect to that request.  In summary, 2011 was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered on our financial objectives; we exceeded our energy efficiency and conservation program targets; we anticipated and responded to adverse weather events in a timely and responsible manner and as a result, we improved our historically high levels of customer service.  Our efforts were also reflected in our stock price, which rose more than 17% in 2011 and hit a nine-year high during the last day of December. We delivered a total return in excess of 22%.  Looking ahead, we’ve outlined some challenges we face in 2012, but as our track record demonstrates, we are committed to delivering on our financial objectives, while providing excellent service and value to our customers. I am confident we’ll deliver on those commitments again this year.  That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions. 
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Thanks. Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Hey Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: On all the regulatory activity that you guys have in process and you expect over the next year, year and a half, how concerned are you about ROE cuts that could come under 10% rather, given where interest rates are and some other rate case decisions we’ve seen across the U.S.?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think it’s a concern Travis and we’ve talked about it before, that the trend is to see lower authorized ROEs. I’d certainly hope we don’t go below 10%, but as you also have heard as I talked about before, I think we have upside even in a falling authorized ROE environment if we can close that regulatory lag that we talk about through things like multi year and the riders that Teresa talked about, so that we actually can make up more ground than we might lose on the authorized basis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. What did you earn in 2011 rather across your service territories?
Ben Fowke: Correct me if I’m wrong Teresa, but on a consolidated basis, I think we earned about 10%. But remember, that reflects a little bit of debt at the holding company, so I would say our average ROE earned at the OPCo’s was probably in low 9%.
Teresa Madden: They ranged 9% to 10% or just that, except for SPS was slightly lower.
Ben Fowke: Yes, so our aggregates probably about low 9% I would think.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Thank you and good morning.
Ben Fowke: Hi Ali.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Ben, to be clear on the Colorado situation, as I recall, after they denied your interim request, you went back with another interim request at a lower amount. Where do we stand on that and is that still possible that they could grant that?
Ben Fowke: They denied that too at the same time that they suggested that we look at the accounting order approach, which as you know we took them up on that suggestion and they did approve that just recently here. That has, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks about a $0.02 positive impact and helps to mitigate the denial of the interim rates.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay, okay. And as you mentioned low 9% ROEs at the OPCo level in ‘11, what’s embedded in the ‘12 guidance assuming as you mentioned you end up in that lower end of the range. What should be the corresponding OPCo ROE roughly there?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think some of the things we’ve talked about, like multi year plans, etcetera certainly are going to help. I think that impact would be more evident in 2013 than 2012. I mean we had the setback on the interim rates as we entered this year. So I suspect that we will probably have about the same kind of ROE at the consolidated level in ‘12 that we have in ‘11.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Consolidated, and also at the OPCo as well, the same thing?
Ben Fowke: Yes, I mean it will be variance. Go ahead Teresa.
Teresa Madden: Yes, it will range in the 9% up to 10% amongst the OPCos. Generally the range, whoever has a rate case in that period, like we will earn a little higher, so if we look at ‘11, Minnesota is slightly higher than Colorado and then it will flip around. So this is somewhat driven, but they are all within that range. It has new rates.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: And Teresa if I heard you correctly earlier, is it fair to say that when you look at lag across the system, is SPS, does that have the largest lag between authorized and earned right now or how would you categorize your biggest lag utilities at this point?
Teresa Madden: Yes, I would say it’s the largest. Their rates are set on a historical test year. So we do see the largest lag and we have less riders in Texas as well.
Ben Fowke: Ali, keep in mind though that SPS has made some pretty significant improvements as we all know from where we were just a few years ago. So, we continue to, I think improve the regulatory compact there and look to do that in future years as well.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Yes, and also one other clarification. Teresa, I think you mentioned the property tax deferral in Minnesota, you asked for that and you’ve assumed you’ll get it. Can you remind us how big of an amount that is?
Teresa Madden: Yes, it’s $28 million and it’s both electric and gas. So even though it came out of the electric case, it’s for both businesses.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Okay, last question, given your assumptions and guidance, fair to assume you’re not looking at any scenario that would cause you to issue equity in ‘12 or could that change depending on stock price, performance, etcetera?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think as we’ve indicated before, we are not planning to issue any equity in ‘12, but we’ll be opportunistic and if we see conditions that would warrant that, we would consider entering into a forward transaction. So we are still in the same position and consistent with we’ve previously indicated.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Thank you very much.
Teresa Madden: Your welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Thank you. I have two questions. The first one is about the retail sales and the weather analyzed load growth. You mentioned that it was disappointing in the fourth quarter and I’m just wondering, is this just purely the economic slowdown or is this sustainable conservation?
Ben Fowke: We were disappointed I think in the last quarter of 2011, which drove the overall year to just a little over a half or six-tenths of a percent. It’s a little bit perplexing, because while haven’t been immune to the recession, generally our states have done very well. Lower unemployment; we’re seeing jobs growth and we didn’t lose as many jobs and where we are seeing a lot of the fall off is in the residential and small C&I.  I wish I had a better explanation for you, but outside of our DSM programs, which probably account for about seven-tenths of a percent of the fall-off and as you know Angie, we are compensated for that; it’s a little harder to explain.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: There’s clearly a trend that we are seeing across the country and pretty much every single utility now says that it has nothing to do with conservation, it’s nor the economy, but yet at DSM macroeconomic indicators seems to be at least mix and maybe slightly even positive and so it’s just hard to believe that pretty much every single region has seen the flattish weather normalized power sales.
Ben Fowke: Well, I mean typically you can add 70 basis points back to whatever our sales are because of our DSM programs. So I would definitely say our DSM programs are having the intended effect, but then once you get past that, whether it’s efficiencies we don’t know about or change in consumer behaviors or there’s a lot of different theories, household consolidation, etcetera, we are not quite sure, but we are certainly seeing it and we are going to have to continue to monitor it.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Okay. My second question is about CSAPR. I recall that you guys mentioned that if CSAPR was in fact implemented on January 1, you would have ran your gas plants more, which in turn would increase your O&M expenses. Now that CSAPR has stayed, that you don’t have to tick up in expenses, shouldn’t that be helping your 2012 guidance?
Ben Fowke: Well Angie, the biggest impact of having to basically turn our dispatch order upside down was the increase in fuel expense, so not the O&M expense, so not too much of a delta on the O&M there.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Okay, okay, that’s fine. Thank you very much.
Ben Fowke: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thanks. I guess when the interim rate relief was originally denied and you guys talked about earning at the low end of the guidance range, the impact of that seems to be on the order of magnitude about a nickel and it looks like you’ve got $0.025 back obviously, based on your ability to defer the Black Hills contract.  So I’m just wondering, since you’re still sort of projecting the low end of your guidance range, did something happen between then and now that’s making you more concerned about other parts of your operation, be it slower load growth or more difficulty potentially in cutting O&M?
Ben Fowke: No. I mean I think the original request would have had about – I think we had it more, I guess $0.06 if we had everything we asked for, which we typically don’t and then we have the account in order to your point which knocks off $0.02 of that, so it’s a setback.  It’s certainly helpful. I think we have a much better opportunity to work our way up towards the middle of the range now as a result, but we continue to have some of the other headwinds that I talked about. We just talked about sales. This has been, I think the fourth warmest winter on record in Minnesota and I don’t have the results for Colorado, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they are not similar and that’s impacting us $0.02, and frankly February is starting out pretty warm too. So those are the things along with property taxes that we’ll have to concentrate on.  We do have plans to mitigate that to some O&M reductions and that will help too. So the order I think was a definite improvement and again, if we get a few breaks we’ll push it back towards the middle.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Based on what you just said, the weather impact so far, you would calculate at about $0.02 negative for the first quarter?
Ben Fowke: Through January, it was $0.02 negative, roughly.
Paul Fremont - Jefferies: Thank you.
Ben Fowke: Your welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Just go ahead.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Hi, good morning. 
Ben Fowke: Hey Dan.
Teresa Madden: Morning.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: First think I was wanting to ask about was, you laid out your CapEx on Page 11 of the release and you put a note in there related to the CSAPR. I just wondered if you could give us a little more color on if the stay were removed, with CapEx should have laid out there for CSAPR stay the same or would that have to be moved in some way?
Ben Fowke: Well, you’re kind of hitting on it Dan. There’s three outcomes, right. They could be reinstated. I don’t think that’s very high likelihood, but it’s certainly possible. It could be repealed completely, which I do think is a possibility or the courts could remand it back to the EPA and ask if they’d modify it in some way.  So we currently have 474 I think or 470 in there for CapEx. If it was reinstated now, we’ll spend about that amount. If it’s repealed, we might not have to spend anything at least in the near term. I think some other rules eventually might catch us, but it certainly will be very favorable, and then somewhere in between if it’s remanded. So I mean obviously that’s about $0.5 billion swing, but that’s where we are right now.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, and if the current rules were enforced, would that impact any of your plants as far as being retired?
Ben Fowke: No, you’re saying if the core came back and just basically restated everything?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Right.
Ben Fowke: We would be back to the plan that we entered the year with and we would, we’d be looking at different dispatches, hopefully find some allowances in the market. We haven’t had a lot of success as you know and we talked about that and we would plan to put the CapEx in. So hopefully that doesn’t happen, at least not with an extension of the compliance base.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. The another thing I had was on your pending rate cases, your ongoing rate cases, where you don’t have the settlements and basically in Colorado Electric and South Dakota Electric. I was wondering what the last authorized ROE is versus what you requested? I think you would lay out what the requested ROE is, but I was curious how those compare with what the last authorized ROEs were.
Ben Fowke: The last authorized ROE in Colorado was 10.5%.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: How about in South Dakota?
Ben Fowke: 10% for South Dakota.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay, thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo: Good morning everyone. Just a quick question on the interim rates and the setback there, and this maybe speculative in nature, but do you think that that has any implications for the appetite of multi year plans in the state? I mean is there any read through there at all?
Ben Fowke: No. I mean, there is two ways to get a multi year, through settlement or through the Commission deciding and I don’t think it really probably impacted very much Neil.  As I said in my remarks, I mean we were obviously disappointed by not getting the interim rates and our interpretation of the Clean Air-Clean Jobs legislation certainly would indicate that we were very much eligible for it, but the Commission looked more to a historical precedent, which is a much tougher bar to meet.  So, it’s disappointing, but I think it’s more of an anomaly given the accounting order. I mean, I still think we have a Commission there that wants to be constructive and understands that what we are trying to accomplish in Colorado is good for the state and good for our customers.
Scott Wilensky: Neil, just as a point of reference to you. During the hearings, the Commission at the end of it also indicated that they’d like to see us work towards the multi year settlement if the parties were interested. So I mean, they clearly gave us the signal that they were open and thought it was a positive thing.
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo: Okay thanks. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. I’d like to turn the call back over to Teresa Madden.
Teresa Madden: Thank you for participating in our year-end earnings conference call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Paul Johnson and the IR team. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. If you’d like to listen to a replay of today’s conference, please dial 303-590-3030 or 800-406-7325 and enter the access code 4502443. We’d like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Xcel Energy’s Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode, and following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today, October 27th, 2011. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Management. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s third quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Sparby, Senior Vice President and Group President; Scott Wilensky, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today, we’ll discuss our third quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we’ll provide an update to our 2011 guidance and introduce 2012 guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. In addition, please note that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Third quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. Third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.69 per share compared with $0.67 per share in 2010. Last year third quarter GAAP earnings include a non-recurring benefit of $0.05 per share related to the settlement of a law suit. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and are more representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental earnings power. Therefore we will be discussing ongoing earnings today, during our review of third quarter results. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings results. I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke, who became CEO of Xcel Energy in August of this year.
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and welcome everyone. Let me just say that I’m truly honored to be CEO of Xcel Energy. We have a great company with a strong balance sheet, a sound strategy, a constructive regulatory environment, a visible pipeline of investment opportunities, engaged employees and a history of delivering on expectations while managing risk. I will build on our great tradition with an emphasis on improving earned returns, while continuing to bright our customers with safe, clean, reliable energy at a reasonable cost. So, with that let me turn to our results. This morning, we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.69 per share compared with $0.62 per share in 2010. These results represent a continuation of solid performance this year and give us confidence that we will deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth objective. Now I’ll brief you on some recent developments, beginning with an update on our regulatory proceedings. This has been a busy one for us with several rate requests pending. As most of you are aware, we arrived at constructive settlements in North Dakota and New Mexico. In North Dakota, the commission recently held hearings on the settlement we reached with staff, which would result in a rate increase of about 14 million in 2011, and an additional spec increase of 2 million in 2012 if approved. This is a black box settlement which was based on a 10.4% ROE. The settlement represents approximately 76% of our requested increase. We also reached a settlement in our electric rate case in New Mexico; the black box settlement is unopposed, resolves all the issues and increases rates by 13.5 million effective January 2012. Here again, the settlement if approved represents approximately 68% of our requested rate increase. We expect the North Dakota and New Mexico commissions to rule on these settlements by year end. We are also discussing a potential settlement agreement in the Minnesota rate case. While we believe our request in Minnesota is reasonable we think working towards a settlement has the potential to leave to a constructive outcome. Especially in light of the delays the case has experienced and considering the overall economic environment. If our efforts are successful we would expect that an agreement could be sent to the commission by year-end. These settlements are up our evidence of our ability to effectively manage regulatory risk. The constructive outcomes if approved position us to continue delivering on our financial objectives in 2011 and beyond.  Next, I would like to comment on EPA’s recently issued Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR, as you are probably aware CSAPR impacts our operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Texas. While we have proactively addressed environmental issues, the late inclusion of Texas and the required compliance by 2012 creates significant issues for SPS.  SPS has very limited options to comply with the rules by January 2012. This short timeframe does not allow for the installation of additional control equipment at our coal plants. In addition SPS doesn’t have many viable options to comply with the new rules due transmission constraints that limit energy import and the expected lack of a liquid allowance market in the region.  Xcel Energy is one of many parties challenging the recently proposed EPA rules. Over 45 petitioners including 13 states, several utilities and others, filed challenges to CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. Twelve separate motions for stay including our motion are pending before the quarter. Although the outcome of any litigation is difficult to predict, we are confident in the strength of our challenges to the rule. Clearly we are not alone in challenging these new rules and are encouraged that FERC Commissioner Moeller has stated that the timing of these rules is too aggressive and could hinder grid reliability. The EPA itself appears to recognize the potential problems with the rule and hence proposed modifications. But we don’t believe these adjustments go far enough to alleviate our concerns, we’re optimistic that a more reasonable time line may be established. To address CSAPR ultimately, we’ll need to increase our capital investments at SPS. We will update you on our plans, including an updated capital expenditure forecast at our analyst meeting in December.  Now most of our comments on our conference calls tend to focus on financial results. However, operational excellence is a cornerstone at Xcel Energy. Periodically, it’s helpful to provide an example to emphasize this point. This summer 80 mile per hour winds and rain damaged 94 miles of infrastructure including transmission lines, turbines, wind collectors and distributors lines in South Western Minnesota. I am pleased to report that we completed the design and reconstruction of 64 miles of transmission infrastructure and energized it with new and stronger structures in less than three months. The remaining wind collector feeders were completed in mid-October. The successful and timely completion of this project demonstrates the people, alliances resources and internal processes are in place to achieve outstanding results.  I would now like to introduce you to Teresa Madden, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Many of you have met Teresa over the years at various investor conferences. I’ve worked with her for many years. She has incredible depth of understanding of every aspect of the company’s finances and I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding CFO. Teresa, the floor is yours.
Teresa Madden: Thanks, Ben for the kind introduction and good morning to everyone on the call. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results, our recent financing activity, update you on other pending rate cases and close with our 2012 earnings guidance. Let’s begin with a review of the significant drivers on the income statement. Strong growth in the third quarter earnings was largely driven by a 139 million increase in electric margin. Significant drivers include a $41 million from interim and final rate in multiple states, a 29 million increase in revenue requirement reflecting the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado. This margin impact is partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property taxes and financing cost associated with these facilities, a $19 million increase from the higher sales as a result of warmer than normal weather and an 18 million increase for conservation and DSM revenue incentives. Natural gas margins increased modestly by 4 million over the quarter. As you’re primarily aware, natural gas usage is relatively minor in the third quarter. Partially offsetting the improvement in our electric and gas margins were increases in a few expense categories that I will review. O&M expenses increased 23 million or 4.6% largely driven by increased plant generation, labor, and employee benefit costs. In addition, due to warmer than normal summer temperatures, we are seeing incremental O&M to ensure continued system reliability and high customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2011 O&M to increase approximately 4.5%, which is modestly above our original guidance of an increase of 4%. Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins was higher depreciation and amortization expense, which increased $21 million or 9.3%. The increase is driven by incremental capital investment including the Nobles Wind Farm that went into service in 2010 and the new two natural gas plants we acquired from Calpine. Higher property taxes, primarily in Colorado and Minnesota, led to a $7 million or 8.8% increases in taxes other than income. Finally, during the quarter, we announced the redemption of $105 million of preferred stock and incurred a call premium of a little over $3 million, which is not tax deductible. These opportunistic financing streamlines, our capital structure and lowers our cost of capital. Now I’ll review the results of each of our operating company. First, earnings in NSP Minnesota increased $0.05 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota and conservation incentives, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense. Second Earnings at PSCo were flat for the quarter. Higher margins primarily due to weather were offset by higher O&M, property taxes and depreciation expense. Third, NSP Wisconsin earnings were also flat for the quarter. The positive impact of new electric rates was offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. Finally, earnings at SPS increased $0.02 per share, largely due to an electric rate increase in Texas and higher sales driven again by hot weather. Similar to our other OPCos, these gains were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense. Now turning to the balance sheet, we were very active on the financing front during the third quarter issuing $700 million of debt at very attractive interest rate. At PSCo, we issued $250 million at 30-year first mortgage bonds with a 4.75% coupon. At SPS, we issued $200 million of 30-year first mortgage bond at 4.5% which temporarily tied the record for the lowest 30-year coupon across all corporate sectors. In addition at the holding company, we took advantage of historically low rates and issued $250 million of 30-year senior note at 4.8%, this represents the lowest 30 year coupon ever for a utility holding company bond. Earlier Ben provided an update on several of the rate cases in which we’ve either greed on are working towards a settlement. We do have a few other rate cases pending that are expected to be wrapped up by year end or in early 2012. In South Dakota we filed request to increase electric rate by 14.6 million based on a 2010 historic test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and an electric rate base of $323 million. There has been delayed in the South Dakota rate case process, and we don’t anticipate a decision until the first quarter of 2012. As a result we are planning to request interim rate to be affective in January of 2012. At NSP Wisconsin we’ve filed a request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to increase electric rates by $29 million and gas rates by $8 million. At filing this based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE and equity ratio of 52.5% and electric rate base of 718 million and a natural gas rate base of $84 million. Earlier this month staff a testimony and recommended an electric rate increase of approximately $18 million and a natural gas rate increase of about $3 million both based on an ROE of 10.3%. The staff recommendation reflects a lower ROE and adjustments to nuclear costs, employee compensation and benefit as well as the recovery of future MGP cost. We filed our rebuttal testimony last week and expect to commission to rule on the case by yearend. We anticipate new rates to be effective in January 2012. Looking ahead, we plan to file an electric rate case in Colorado during the fourth quarter. As you recall we are required to file an electric rate case in Colorado prior to April 2012. A few noteworthy items, we plan on requesting interim rate to be effective in the first quarter of 2012 and we are also discussing the possibility of a multiyear rate plan with key stakeholders to determine whether this approach can be implemented through this case. Constructive outcomes in these cases combined with the anticipated approval of the settlements in New Mexico and North Dakota, as well as the constructed outcome in Minnesota are key components of our 2012 earnings guidance, which we are introducing today. For 2012, we expect earnings to be in a range of $1.75 to a $1.85 per share, which is consistent with our 5% to 7% earnings growth adjusted. Using 2009 as the base here, the low end of the 2012 guidance range represents 5% compounded earnings growth with the upper end representing compound earnings growth of 7%. Some of the key drivers for 2012 include very modest electric and gas sales growth including the impact of an additional way of sales due to the leap year, stepping rates in Minnesota, new rates in Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, increased rates from the planned 2012 Colorado electric case. Incremental revenue from various capital writers and finally increased an AFUDC equity earnings associated with our capital investment program. These drivers will be offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. For more information see our earnings release for a listing of our preliminary assumptions. We plan to provide additional information related to our 2012 forecast including an updated five year capital expenditure plan at our analyst meeting on December 1St in New York. In closing we’re pleased to report another strong quarter. As we enter the last few months of 2011 Xcel Energy is well positioned for continued success. We are on track to deliver 2011 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We financed our growth as historically low interest rate. We’re continuing to demonstrate our ability to manage regulatory risk across several jurisdictions, and finally we’ve established 2012 guidance that is consistent with our earnings objective of 5% to 7% growth. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator we will now take questions.
Operator:  Thank you. We’ll now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Keith (inaudible). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:  Just a couple of quick questions. First of all I was hoping you could give us a little sense of what the other key stakeholders in Colorado, who they would be and some kind of read on how likely you think it is that a multi-year plan would be a possibility. And secondly I’d be interested in what your ‘12 guidance or outlook assumes about equity issuance?
Ben Fowke:  Well, I’ll at least the first part of that question. Keith, I think our stakeholders in Colorado are just who you would think they would be. The commission itself, the staff, the consumer abdicate groups and of course, largest C&I type customers. So we’re working with all of those stakeholders now as we try to put together a plan that they can buy in to and that’s been a significant portion of our outreach efforts over the last year. In terms of equity I’ll let Teresa, handle that.
Teresa Madden:  In terms of equity we’re currently not planning to issue any equity outside of our DRIP programs for 2012. However, we will be opportunistic and if condition warrants we potentially could maybe enter into a forward equity sale. But currently no plans for any equity issuances outside just our normal DRIP.
Operator:  And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  I am glad I didn’t change jobs again. Your analyst day is going to be in early December and final mercury rules posting date has been delayed now till mid-December. So are still going to get a reasonably good read on what you think the potential environmental spend is going to look like or is that something that we’re going to wait for until after we see the final rule.
Unidentified Company Representative:  Greg, I don’t know which rule you are referring to...
Greg Gordon – ISI Group:  The mercury rule.
Ben Fowke:  Yes, I think the biggest variable for us is going to be the CSAPR Rule. And that as you know as I mentioned in my remarks we are litigating, we’ll probably get some kind of response first quarter I think is what we’re anticipating next year. So that’ll be a little bit later most likely than when we are at the analyst meeting. But we have run various scenarios on how we would respond and how we can respond to CSAPR and we’re going to share that with you in December.  Now Greg keep in mind that last year when we issued the CapEx forecast, we had a placeholder for all of these EPA rules and if I recall correctly at SPS it was about 400 million during the five year timeframe. So we’ll update that obviously timing and some other things might change. But I think we are anticipating at some time having to having to do these things. We just weren't anticipating having to do it by January of this year, coming year.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with Keybanc. Please go ahead
Paul Ridzon – Keybanc:  A couple of things can you kind of put bookings with the impact of trading and fuel swings were in the quarter. It looks like that might have driven part of the earnings.
Teresa Madden:  In terms of trading it was very small, and when you say fuel, in terms of you referring to the deferred fuel adjustments?
Paul Ridzon – Keybanc:  Yes.
Teresa Madden:  That deferred fuel adjustment was actually in the third quarter of last year and it was around $20 million. So actually this year we don’t have any adjustments like that. So that’s the primary driver.
Paul Ridzon – Keybanc:  Okay. Thank you again. With the expedition of the process for the Hampton-La Crosse line, how do you view that impact? Do you think it’ll get accelerated or does it make you feel comfortable with the current schedule?
Ben Fowke:  It makes us feel comfortable with the current schedule, Paul.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company:  Thank you very much. Quick question just on understanding sort of the upcoming Colorado filing. Should we assume that just to stay even with where you are right now, you’re going to need to file at least for the $121 million of non-fuel expense that’s currently in the rider?
Scott Wilensky:  This is Scott. We would need to incorporate the transfer of what currently in the PCCA rider for the Calpine assets into our base rate request. And you’re right, that’s about 120 million. We’d also anticipate that we’d have rate request that’s incremental to that.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company:  Okay, but in other words, the comparator then should be anything over and above 120 million would be essentially an increase over what you’re currently collecting in that state?
Scott Wilensky:  That’s right and we actually noticed the filing, there is legal notice that would require that we indicate that 120 million is part of the request, but as we’ve tried to share this with our customers, we’ll indicate that the level we increase is, the true increase to customers build not the transfer the Calpine assets from the rider debase.
Paul Fremont – Jefferies & Company:  And just as a point of clarification, I’m assuming that premium paid for the preferred stock is a non-recurring expense item even though it’s included in your ongoing EPS calculation.
Teresa Madden:  It is non-recurring, that’s correct.
Operator:  And our next question comes from the line of Carl Seligson with Utility Financial Experts. Please go ahead.
Carl Seligson – Utility Financial Experts:  I’m somewhat concerned although it’s been beaten back on other places, about what’s going on in Boulder and the effect that that might have other Colorado communities as far as municipalization. Could you give us a few words on that?
Ben Fowke:  Yes, the votes by ballot are due November 1st, so I’ll be able to tell you how it all turned out, pretty shortly. You know Carl, Boulder has had a history of wanting to municipalize. I don’t really don’t think it’s indicative of other cities and municipalities in Colorado. You know and just to reiterate, I mean we want to continue to serve Boulder, I think well, you might have be aware, Carl, we had a major snow storm in Colorado and it impacted Boulder. And I think it’s another example of the service we provide and we were prepared, we call crews up from SPS and out from Grand Junction, and we had them ready and available the night before the snow storm. So we do a pretty good job of serving, we do a good job of providing reliable energy and clean energy, and I sure hope the citizens see it that way too, if not we’ll work with them, and it will take a while, but we’ll figure out the fair price, so that our other customers in Colorado aren’t disadvantaged. But I don’t think, the short answer to your question is, that it’s a trend that you’re going to see across our jurisdiction.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Justin McCann with S&P Capital. Please go ahead.
Justin McCann – S&P Capital:  Regarding the economic outlook in your service territories, in which state do you have the greatest concern?
Ben Fowke:  Greatest concern?
Justin McCann – S&P Capital:  Yes.
Ben Fowke:  I would say that the states that we’re seeing the flattest sales would be Minnesota and in Colorado, which happens to be our two largest states.
Justin McCann – S&P Capital:  All right.
Ben Fowke:  We are seeing much greater sales in Texas and we’re seeing an uptick in Wisconsin as well. So you got to keep in mind though that when the recession hit the hardest a few years ago, we were much less impacted than other parts of the country. So we are not seeing that rebound, we continued to see sluggish and flat sales, but we weren’t hurt as bad others to begin with. And there are signs that the larger C&I customers are starting to pick up, they always had in Texas, but in other regions as well.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha – SunTrust:  Ben or Teresa, I mean going back to your plans for equity issuance, I know in the past you’ve said no earlier than 2012, which would imply say ‘12 or ‘13 just given the CapEx program, is that still a fair way to think about it, I mean if it’s not ‘12, it’s likely ‘13, but you may be opportunistic in ‘12, is that the way we should be thinking about equity?
Teresa Madden:  Well, as I’ve said before, we’re not planning any in 2012, but if we saw an opportunistic option, we may potentially sell an equity forward.
Ben Fowke:  Ali, I don’t think there’s anything more we comment on related to equity. And as a point two, we’ve always said no equity in 11; we haven’t really talked about ‘12 before.
Ali Agha – SunTrust:  Okay. That’s right. Maybe I was getting my ears mixed up.
Ben Fowke:  Yes, I think what we have done Ali then is just give the amount of equity we need over multiyear timeframe and we look at market conditions and all the other things that you would think and we pick when the best time is.
Ali Agha – SunTrust:  Okay. And then second question, just looking at the results as they’ve come true, say maybe on an LTM basis and I don’t know if you whether adjust or not, but can you just remind us what kind of lag is still in the system in terms of what the earned ROEs are versus authorized across the portfolio?
Teresa Madden:  Sure, Ali. In terms of our earned ROE at the utility, there tends to be around an average of up to about 100 basis points. So we do pickup from leveraging the holding company about around 50 basis points. Hopefully that helps.
Ben Fowke:  Well, Ali, you raised this question, I think it’s a great one. We certainly are going to address regulatory lag. We have the writers, we have the forward testers, but things like an expanded CapEx program sluggish sales, they’ve kind of kept those spinning our wheels on regulatory lag. Multiyear rate cases etcetera will help tremendously to close that lag and we’re under earning now. So I think we can close that gap that would be a nice pickup for us.
Ali Agha – SunTrust:  Just to get a flavor I mean given the flurry of rate cases going on and so on, I’m just curious I mean that’s always that lag, but where would you say you are in the cycle, is it historically I mean the narrower than normal, wider, I mean just to get some flavor of how it’s looking?
Ben Fowke:  I mean we’ve – we are enjoying some good weather this year always, so it’s a little bit – I would just say it’s normal and if there is anybody else who has a different break on it.
Teresa Madden:  I think that’s correct.
Ali Agha – SunTrust:  Yes. And then final question, looking at your remainder of PPAs with other IPPs. Are you seeing more opportunity today to do that Calpine type acquisition of assets or other conditions or the PPA terms not ripe today to replicate something like that?
Ben Fowke:  Well, it’s a great question. We are always looking, we’re filing resource plans in our two major jurisdictions here over the next, I guess it would be the next month, and you will see what kind of resource we need and you kind of have to start there. Then we’ll work backwards with the opportunities that go with IPPs and PPAs. Always looking Ali if it makes sense and we’ll do it but I don’t see anything any, it’s kind of new neutral I guess is what I would say that this point.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of the Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Leslie Rich – JPMorgan:  Hi. I wondered if I could go back to Texas for a minute for FPS and CSAPR assuming that you can’t install a scrubber in 15 minutes. And that you are forced to comply by 2012. I assume you would be purchasing emissions allowances, is that recoverable from customers in terms of a passer or would that be absorbed by shareholders?
Ben Fowke:  No, that’s all what we would do is recoverable, Leslie I am not sure that there is much of an emission allowance market and that’s the problem. So when we think about what we would do, if we had a compliant 2012, we’d obviously wait to see if that emissions to market developed, but in the absence of that we would try to basically a lot of ways turn our system upside down and run gas plants more like base load plants and not run our coal plants nearly as often.  So the cost of that would be fuel and that fuel is that’s passed through to our customers. Obviously we don’t think that’s a good plan from a cost perspective and clearly it’s not a good plan from a reliability perspective. Hence the suit that we’ve filed and again I just think there has to be a more reasonable outcome than a 2012 compliance plan.
Leslie Rich – JPMorgan:  So, if compliance was pushed off, say one year, would that yield the same strategy?
Ben Fowke:  I think one year will be pretty tough too Leslie, I think it takes time to put, I think the plan would probably be SCRs and NCRs and Scrubbers and/or DCI technology and that takes time. So we would be looking for a longer timeframe than that.
Leslie Rich – JPMorgan:  Okay. But importantly the environmental CapEx, the incremental fuel cost from coal gas switching and then the emissions allowance cost are all recoverable?
Ben Fowke:  That’s our assumption. And that would be the best practice.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Acres with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo:  As a follow up to that question, as you see CapEx ramping at SPS, can you remind us what kind of recovery mechanisms you have in place that you are going to be spending a lot on environmental, do you have the writer and if don’t would you pursue a writer in Texas?
Ben Fowke:  Well, the recovery platform at SPS has improved. We continue to make sure that we can continue to improve it. So at this point we don’t have a writer to cover these sorts of things, but I think we have the opportunity in just like we have in Colorado we are working with our stakeholders down there and I think we have a lot of stakeholder support to do the right thing for the system and get the kind of recovery we need to. So we are not there yet, but it’s my anticipation that we would have a good regulatory plan to go along with this, Dave or Scott anyone of you want to add anything.
Scott Wilensky:  I would just add is we do have about 50% of our loan in the whole sale market there and that’s on a formula rate and that would be picked up immediately even without writer really for the states.
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo:  Okay, it’s great. And since the last quarter do you have any update or progress on potentially adding wind in South Dakota?
Ben Fowke:  Are you talking about North Dakota?
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo:  Yes. I apologize; where (inaudible) was canceled then there might have been a follow on.
Ben Fowke:  Yes. We continue to look for opportunities there and we don’t have anything to announce. But I can tell you that we continue to look for the opportunities and be in a position of with take care of production tax credit but obviously the math has to work for our customers as well.
Operator:  Thank you the next question comes from the line of Scott (inaudible). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi. Thank you. Can you give us a sense of any increase or decrease in pension expense you expect to see in ‘12 from ‘11 if all the marks were made today, with the returns and discounts rates and everything?
Teresa Madden:  We are expecting to see some increase between ‘11 and ‘12 and I would say in general, it’s probably in the $30 million to $40 million range. And we do have that included in terms of our assumption. We have based that on a somewhat lower discount rate and we currently have in our 2011 at a 5.5% discount rate. So we have taken that into consideration. We do expect to see some increase, but we have factored that into our guidance.
Unidentified Analyst:  Okay.
Ben Fowke:  I just might add to your question that coming into the year, our plans were some of the better funded plans in the industry. We took a conservative approach with our plans. So while lower discount rates and asset performance in general hasn’t been stellar this year as well all know. I think we’re in a lot better shape and we’ll be in a lot better shape by the end of the year. So it’s an expense for us but we’re a better positioned I believe than most.
Unidentified Analyst:  Okay, thanks. And then also just can you give us any color on why guys kind of like the forward sale equity mechanism versus any of the other options?
Scott Wilensky:  I think the reason we like to forward is there is the ability to avoid the dilution impact. There is a cost to use in a forward and so you want if you can use it, you don’t want to have something like that at least we don’t want it have it outstanding for a year. But if you like the price of equity and you want to delay the dilution for four to six months, it’s not a bad way to go.
Ben Fowke:  I think if you have a large capital expenditure, it’s not a bad risk management tool either. But it’s just one tool that we have at our disposal.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  I just wanted to touch base with you on the wind contract that guys have with FPL. Did you guys already discuss this; I apologize because I’ve been distracted a little bit here and there.
Ben Fowke:  You’re talking about the alignment of two projects?
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Yes, the one that decreased rates, same as you guys have made an announcement about and I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit about what sort of drove that and how things look in terms of the wind story out there in.
Ben Fowke:  Yes, Paul I mean I think what drove our decision to pursue that is that we think the economics much less the environmental benefits speak for themselves, the pricing was so attractive that. One of the things that I think we probably need to do a better job of is just talk about the economics of our wind portfolio which average over years and as if the prices are lower today about $40 megawatt an hour which on an energy basis is not a bad hedge against natural gas. And this is the same kind of thought process which drove us to say, it’s a pretty good deal that’s offered to our customers. So I don’t know if you are interested in the approval process but...
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Well, I’d think you’d get it, I mean it seems like a remarkable I guess benefit for customers particularly, but I mean was that sort of a something particularly unusual about that project or is that’s what you are sort of seeing because of the what you’re seeing out there just with the fundamentals of the market. I just wonder if you add a little bit to it, I would talk to you guys offline about it, just sort of wondering if there is there any kind of remarkably sort of beneficial story.
Ben Fowke:  I think it’s a product of lot of things, I mean if you look at wind; it tends to have some correlation with price of natural gas. There is a lot of uncertainty around production tax credits expire in 2012. So I think developers are interested in moving where they can and I think this is a great site with very good capacity and some new turbine technology. So, all those things came together to make for I think compelling economic deal. I mean there is other opportunities like that as well. But everything has to come together as this one did.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates:  Okay. I didn’t mean to cut you off on the regulatory processes, is there anything that we should be thinking about as being an issue there or I mean it just seems like it was such, I don’t know maybe I am missing, but I am sort of playing dunk, I don't…
Ben Fowke:  No, I think from my perspective, I think the issue is whether or not we put this in our wind source program or whether or not we just think it up to normal system. I think the deal you are right is the economics are pretty compelling; it’s just a matter of how we want to introduce it into our portfolio.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  I was just wondering, I noticed in your discussion on the Minnesota rate case, you mentioned that their decision to delay the (inaudible) power upgrades. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what went into that decision and how we should think about that plant going forward?
Ben Fowke:  Sure, Dan it’s really two drivers, one we have some delays in equipment and we also are seeing some delays in the NRC license and so all those things together let’s just push it off to a scheduled refueling in the spring of 2013. So it’s just simple as that really.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay. So it’s just held outside of the rate period, say it will just be done at that in a couple of years as opposed to…
Ben Fowke:  Yes. It will be picked up in the rate case that we file.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Is there the amount of the up rate still expect to be the same and so forth?
Ben Fowke:  Yes. It’s still economic and it’s still about the same.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay. I also noticed you mentioned in our financing plans that you plan to refinance the two issues that are maturing in 2012, well, do you expect any need for debt financing beyond just the refinancing of those two issues in 2012?
Ben Fowke:  Yes. We’ve got 450 million maturing at NSP Minnesota, 600 million at (inaudible) and we would expect incremental debt issuance beyond that and.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Do you have a size of potentially range of…?
Ben Fowke:  We’re still working through the numbers. I mean, it’s probably I would say between the two of them, you’ll see a couple of hundred million more of debt. And we’ll also look at NSP Wisconsin and SPS; there could be some smaller issuances there.
Dan Jenkins – State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay. And then somewhat related to that, since you have 2012 guidance does the CapEx plan for 2012 still pretty much in line with what you’ve reported before or do you have any additional color you can give us on 2012 CapEx?
Ben Fowke:  We’ll update our CapEx working forecast on December 1st our Analyst Day, Dan. So, we’ll give you a new 12 to 16 forecast. I mean this CapEx forecast will go up a bit.
Operator:  Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I’d like to turn the call back over to Teresa for closing remarks.
Teresa Madden: Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. I look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference in November, and at our Analyst Meeting in New York at New York Stock Exchange on December 1st. If any of you have any follow up questions, please contact Paul or the IR team, and thanks a lot.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Paul Johnson – MD, IR and Assistant Treasurer Benjamin Fowke – President, CEO and COO David Sparby – VP and CFO Scott Wilensky – VP, Regulatory and Resource Planning
Analysts:  Justin McCann – Standard & Poors Investment Advisory, Inc. Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Greg Reiss – Catapult Capital Management Travis Miller – Morningstar Research Mike Bates – D. A. Davidson & Co. Jim Bellessa – D. A. Davidson & Co. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 28, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s second quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today, we plan to cover our second quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2011 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of the comments we make may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. You will notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Second quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.33 per share compared with $0.29 per share in 2010. The second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.33 per share compared with $0.30 per share in 2010. While there are no differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings during the second quarter of 2011, the second quarter of 2010 included a $0.01 per share benefit due to recognition of a tax benefit related to a previously-held investment. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of results, and is representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental core earnings power. As a result, we will only discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings. I will now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Benjamin Fowke: Thank you, Paul, and welcome to everyone on today’s call. This morning, we reported second-quarter ongoing earnings of $0.33 per share compared with $0.29 per share in 2010. As a result, we remain well-positioned to deliver ongoing earnings within our 2011 earnings guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Dave will discuss second-quarter results in more detail in a few moments. Let me now bring you up-to-date on some recent developments, all of which are favorable to our customers and supportive of our goals. We continue to make excellent progress on our transmission construction plans, as witnessed most recently with the completion of the Midway project in Colorado, a project consisting of 82 miles of 345 kV transmission line. In June, we passed an important milestone regarding one of the CapX2020 transmission lines. The MISO Board of Directors granted approval for the Brookings transmission line on the condition that this project is included in the full portfolio of multi-value projects being approved in December 2011. Our CapX2020 transmission project remains on schedule. These transmission projects will facilitate access to renewable energy and improve reliability for our customers. There are also positive developments regarding our nuclear operations. We are pleased that the NRC renewed the operating licenses for our Prairie Island nuclear generating units for 20 years. The renewal will allow units one and two to continue to provide emission-free power to our customers through 2033 and 2034, respectively. These units have operated in a safe, reliable, economic, and environmentally sound manner for nearly 40 years and our significant investments to support life extension will enable continued solid performance for the next 20 years. Another positive event for our customers was the settlement we reached with the federal government regarding costs incurred by NSP and its customers related to the DOE’s failure to provide long-term spent fuel storage facility by the required deadline. Under the terms of the settlement, the federal government will pay NSP approximately $100 million for spent fuel storage costs at our nuclear plants incurred through 2008. The federal government will also pay for spent fuel storage costs incurred from 2009 through 2013. We project those costs to be an incremental $100 million. Finally, the settlement does not address costs for used fuel storage after 2013, which could be the subject of future litigation. Settlement funds will be refunded to our customers in our NSP service territory. As you know, we are striving to improve regulatory recovery and reduce regulatory lag in each of our jurisdictions. In that regard, another significant development occurred in Minnesota this spring, when a law was passed which allows utilities to file multi-year rate plans. As a result, we plan to seek to implement a multi-year plan that would establish rates for a three-year period, adjusting rates annually based on our investments and costs. We will first propose a multi-year plan in Minnesota, potentially followed by similar proposals in North Dakota and South Dakota. Undertaking a significant change in our regulatory process will require collaboration with stakeholders to demonstrate the benefits of the plan. We anticipate proposing to implement the plan concurrent with the 2013 Minnesota Electric Rate Case filing expected to be filed in November 2012. Finally, we continue to make significant progress on our efforts to provide our customers with competitively-priced renewable energy and to meet the 30% renewable portfolio standards in Minnesota and Colorado. We recently took advantage of favorable market conditions for the development of new wind projects by signing long-term renewable energy purchase agreements in Minnesota and Colorado. In Minnesota, we contracted to purchase 200 megawatts of wind energy to be generated at the Prairie Rose Wind Farm in Southwest Minnesota; while in Colorado, we agreed to purchase 200 megawatts of wind energy from the Limon Wind Energy Center. In addition, we’ve been negotiating with several wind developers for the potential ownership of a wind project in North Dakota. These projects will provide our customers with competitively-priced energy and increase the amount of emission-free generation in our portfolio. I’ll now turn the call over to Dave.
David Sparby: Thanks, Ben. Let’s begin by reviewing second-quarter earnings results at our four utilities. Earnings at NSP Minnesota increased $0.04 per share, largely due to higher interim electric rates in Minnesota and North Dakota, partially offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense. Earnings at PSCo decreased $0.02 per share, primarily due to seasonal rates which were implemented in June 2010, higher O&M, property taxes, and depreciation expense. At NSP Wisconsin, earnings increased $0.01 per share, due to the implementation of new electric rates, partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation. At SPS, earnings were flat for the quarter.
 : Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $7 million for the quarter, driven primarily by weather and recovery of conservation expenses and incentives. The improvement in our second-quarter electric and natural gas margins was partially offset by O&M expenses, which increased $16 million or 3%; higher plant generation costs; and higher labor and contract labor costs were the primary drivers of the increase. Through the first half of the year, O&M expenses increased 4.5%, which is consistent with our expectations. We continue to project 2011 O&M costs to increase approximately 4%. Also offsetting some of the improvement in margins, depreciation and amortization increased $17.8 million or 8.4% versus the comparable period last year due primarily to several plants going into service in 2010, including Comanche Unit 3, the Nobles Wind Project, and the acquisition of two natural gas plants. In addition, we experienced an $11.5 million or 14.2% increase in non-income taxes. The increase was primarily due to higher property taxes in Colorado and Minnesota. Let’s move on to our financing plans. Our plan enables us to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong credit metrics. As I’m sure you can appreciate, this plan is subject to change depending on the timing of capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions, and other factors. Our financing plans for 2011 are relatively light. We plan to issue approximately $250 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo during the third quarter and approximately $200 million of bonds at SPS in the third quarter. In addition, Xcel Energy also anticipates issuing approximately $75 million of equity through our DRIP and various benefit programs. Now I’ll provide an update on several of our pending and recent rate cases. In Minnesota, we are requesting $123 million of electric rate increase for 2011 and a $45 million increase for 2012, both based on a 10.85% ROE. The primary intervener, the Department of Energy Resources, is recommending a 2011 rate increase of approximately $85 million and a $34 million increase for 2012, based on a 10.37% ROE. The main difference between our position and the Department’s is ROE. During the second quarter, we established a provision of approximately $15 million for the Minnesota Electric Rate Case. This reserve is sufficient to address an outcome that is more consistent with the Department’s position and NSP Minnesota’s position on several issues. However, we strongly believe that the appropriate level of rate recovery is our request of $123 million, and we’ll continue to advocate for our position. We are anticipating an ALJ recommendation in the fall and a PUC order in the fourth quarter, although there will be some delay as a result of the recent government shutdown in Minnesota. In Colorado, we reached a constructive settlement in our natural gas rate case. The settlement effectively provides approximately $21 million in additional revenue, beginning in September 2011. In addition, a rider for gas pipeline integrity cost is projected to add an additional $13 million in revenue in 2012. Turning to North Dakota; we are requesting a 2011 electric rate increase of $18 million and a 2012 electric rate increase of $2.4 million, based on an 11.25% ROE. Interim rates of $17.4 million were effective in February. Intervener testimony is expected in mid-August; rebuttal testimony in September; and evidentiary hearings in October. We anticipate a final decision in the first quarter of 2012. And, in South Dakota, in June 2011 NSP Minnesota filed a request to increase electric rates $14.6 million, based on a 2010 historic test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes; an 11% ROE; an equity ratio of 52.5%; and an electric rate base of $323 million. South Dakota does not allow interim rates but they typically process rate cases in about six to seven months. Final rates are expected to be effective in early 2012. At NSP Wisconsin, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission at Wisconsin to increase electric rate to $29 million and gas rate to $8 million. The filing is based on a 2012 forecast test year, 10.75% ROE, and an equity ratio of 52.5%. NSP Wisconsin’s 2012 rate base is forecast to be approximately $718 million for the electric utility and $84 million for the natural gas utility. Finally, in New Mexico, as you recall, last February SPS filed an electric rate case with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, seeking an annual base rate increase of approximately $20 million. The rate filing is based on a 2011 test year adjusted for 2012 known and measurable changes; a requested ROE of 11.25%; an electric rate base of $390 million; and an equity ratio of 51%. Rates are expected to go into effect during the first quarter of 2012. That concludes my regulatory update. In summary, we had another good quarter, highlighted by several positive outcomes. Our strong financial results position us to meet our annual earnings guidance. We received conditional approval for our Brookings transmission line. We received approval to extend the operating license of our Prairie Island nuclear plant by 20 years. We were awarded a $100-million settlement from the DOE. The Minnesota Legislature passed a bill, authorizing multi-year rate plans we contracted for 400 megawatts of wind power. We’ve made good progress on our multiple rate cases. The Board of Directors raised the annual dividend by $0.03 per share, and the Board ensured a smooth management transition, naming Ben Fowke to succeed Chairman and CEO, Dick Kelly, upon his retirement next month. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Justin McCann with Standard & Poor’s. Please go ahead.
Justin McCann – Standard & Poors Investment Advisory, Inc.: Good morning.
David Sparby: Good morning.
Justin McCann – Standard & Poors Investment Advisory, Inc.: Two things; one, what are the conditions of the conditional approval for the Brookings transmission line? And two, an update on Minot.
David Sparby: What was the second half of that question, Justin? An update on...?
Justin McCann – Standard & Poors Investment Advisory, Inc.: An update on Minot, the flooding.
Paul Johnson: Minot, the flooding.
David Sparby: Okay. Well, with respect to the Brookings line, the condition is the approval of the remainder of the portfolio under condition – under consideration at the end of the year. And, the flooding situation in Minot, the recovery tends to go well up there. Obviously, there was significant amount of damage to the system but it – we continue to recover as we planned.
Justin McCann – Standard & Poors Investment Advisory, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. Good morning.
David Sparby: Good morning, Ali.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Ben or Dave, I believe you mentioned that your O&M expense through the first half are pretty much on plan. Could you also let us know your – the retail sales – weather-adjusted retail sales that you’ve been seeing so far, how they are comparing to plan? And any change for your outlook from listening to your customers looking forward?
David Sparby: Sure, Ali. The – certainly, the first half of the year sales were a little weaker than we anticipated. It’s important to remember, though, there were some unique events in the first half of the year. We had the Texas cold snap if you recall. That was a fairly significant impact. Second quarter, in Colorado we had some large customers also that had some fairly unique situations. And, it’s also important to remember that our conservation programs, of course, are running very well for us in the first half of the year. That said, certainly our local economies, like others, face some headwinds from higher gasoline prices and other impacts during the first half of the year. And so, we are at the lower half of our guidance range that we provided in terms of sales for the remainder of the year.
Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Ali. I would also add to Dave’s comments that July has been an extremely hot month for us across all of our service territories. And, it’s been pretty active from a storm perspective too. So, just factor that into your analysis as well.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And, also related to that, just remind me and I think, Ben, you alluded to that, in terms of making sure you minimized regulatory lag. Where do we stand currently, if you look at, say, LTM, ROEs, et cetera? What kind of lag are you currently estimating in your system?
David Sparby: Well, we’re currently anticipating at an Xcel basis to earn about 10% this year, Ali. We continue to make progress reducing regulatory lag, as you saw in the settlement of our Texas case. We certainly did win the ability to defer some costs and have a 2012 step – looking at putting a 2012 step in place in our Minnesota case and our North Dakota case. So, we continue to make progress that we can point to on reducing that regulatory lag.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And, then just to keep it apples-to-apples, the 10% you expect to earn across the Xcel – at the Xcel level, what would that compare to in terms of authorized ROE?
David Sparby: Well, the – probably the average, and of course each state is fairly unique, but probably the average authorized right now is close to 10.5%.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, got it. And, last question; any further updates or thinking on the next round of equity offering? Is that still something that you will look at in 2012? Or, have the timelines changed somewhere on that?
David Sparby: We’ve said, Ali, that we don’t have any intention to offer equity this year and we have provided no guidance following 2011.
Benjamin Fowke: Ali, you usually – this is Ben. You usually ask about the ROEs, and Dave’s absolutely right. Consolidated ROEs are about 10%. But, remember, we do have some additional leverage at the holdco. So, when you really look at what our utilities are earning, the lag is a little more pronounced than what it might appear on the surface. That’s the challenge but that’s also the opportunity if we can close that gap through multiyear plans etcetera and get closer to our authorized ROEs.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And Ben is that usually like a 50 basis point extension?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes, I think, I’m looking at the group, I think it’s probably about 50, maybe a little bit more of that, so that would imply that the regulated utilities are earning somewhere around $9.5, so about 100 basis points off of the authorized. So I mean that’s the opportunity and the challenge for us.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Correct. You’re right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Greg Reiss with Catapult Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Greg Reiss – Catapult Capital Management: Hi, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.
David Sparby: Thanks, Greg.
Greg Reiss – Catapult Capital Management: Just real quick question, could you just comment a little bit more about this $15 million refund? Does that mean you are not currently booking earnings on a portion of that $123 million interim request?
David Sparby: What we said, Greg, is we reserved $15 million second quarter and that reflects our assessment of looking at the issues and also that it’s more consistent with the DOER’s position on several issues in the case.
Greg Reiss – Catapult Capital Management: And do you anticipate to reserve any more money going forward?
David Sparby: We would anticipate, yes, reserving another $15 million over the remainder of the year.
Greg Reiss – Catapult Capital Management: Got it. Thanks, guys.
David Sparby: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you (Operator Instructions) And our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: Good morning.
David Sparby: Good morning, Travis.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: A quick follow-up on that last one. If you’re going to take those charges, why would you keep your request at that same level? Because you’re roughly in line right now with the interim rate so if you have another $30 million or so why wouldn’t that result in another decrease in your request?
David Sparby: Well, we strongly believe that our request is appropriate and is consistent with the cost of the company so it remains our request. Our reserve reflects our review of the current positions of the Department as well as some Commission decisions as well.
Benjamin Fowke: Travis, I mean, it’s basically the principle of conservativism. So that’s what we’re doing while we continue to push for a better outcome than what we’re reserving for.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: Okay. So it suggests that you would expect somewhere in the range of a $93 million increase?
David Sparby: Yeah, we do expect to prevail on our request. We’re reflecting, once again, the Department’s position as well as some Commission decisions.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: Okay. What’s the impact from bonus depreciation in the rate cases that you filed, say, in the last six months?
David Sparby: We have really seen very little impact. Because we were in an NOL position entering into the rate cases, it’s had very little impact on us. Some movement of monies between companies, but no revenue requirement impact, Travis.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: Okay. So it hasn’t reduced rate base all that much –
David Sparby: No.
Travis Miller – Morningstar Research: ...for any particular one? Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Bellessa with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Mike Bates – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning, guys; this is actually Michael Bates here with Jim. I had a couple of questions for you. In reference to the legislation in Minnesota that’s going to allow you to file these multiyear rate plans, can you give us just a little more color on how receptive has the PUC been to the concept? And will there be any need for a change in legislation to file these plans in North and South Dakota in the future?
David Sparby: Well, the PUC has shown some interest in the plans. They certainly are interested in seeing a plan come from us. With respect to the question about North Dakota, I’m not sure, Scott, do you have an answer for that?
Scott Wilensky: I think that the Dakotas we would not need legislation. They’ve been more willing to exercise their general authority on alternative rate-making. We’ve actually had alternative rate-making plans in North Dakota in the past. So we don’t expect that need. Minnesota, when they’ve actually wanted to move to alternative rate-making, has done that by legislation and that’s why this was so important to get done.
Mike Bates – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Got you. Okay. And then one other question. You mentioned that you’re negotiating at this point for a possible ownership of a North Dakota-based wind project. Can you give us any idea of what the timeframe or the size of that project might end up being?
David Sparby: Well, I can tell you we recently filed a kind of a brief progress report with the North Dakota Commission. We informed them that we continue to make good progress and will update them in other couple weeks as to where we stand at that point in time. That’s about all the additional color I can provide at this point.
Jim Bellessa – D. A. Davidson & Co.: This is Jim Bellessa and I have a question about the municipalization efforts in Boulder, Colorado. I don’t believe I heard much from the Company. I heard a lot from Boulder, Colorado, but does company have any comment?
Benjamin Fowke: Well, this is Ben. I mean, yes, you’re hearing a lot of press about it, but I think you’re starting to also see some of the facts come out. And the bottom line is that we believe municipalization would be a bad thing for the citizens and customers that reside in Boulder. I ultimately think the facts will speak for themselves and they won’t vote for municipalization. If they do, and I think it’d be an unfortunate thing if they vote for municipalization, be assured that we will make sure that we get a fair price and include elements of fair market value of our asset separation cost, stranded cost, etcetera. And we’ll make sure we get the price that we’re entitled to so that our customers in Colorado, outside of Boulder, aren’t harmed nor are our shareholders. But, in a nutshell, I think it’s a bad idea for Boulder. And I think what we offer in terms of price, reliability, and environmental leadership is pretty tough to beat.
Jim Bellessa – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you (Operator Instructions)
David Sparby: Okay. Well, I want to thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings call this morning. We look forward to meeting with many of you in the next couple weeks. If you have any follow-up questions, please direct them to Paul Johnson and the IR team, who are available to take your calls. Thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. If you’d like to listen to a replay of today’s conference, please dial 303-590-3030 or 1-800-406-7325, followed by the access code of 4451887 and the pound sign. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q1  (2011-04-28 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Paul A. Johnson – Managing Director – Investor Relations Benjamin G. S. Fowke III – President and Chief Operating Officer David M. Sparby – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Michael Bates – D.A. Davidson & Co.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Xcel Energy First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, April 28, 2011. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead. 
Paul A. Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy’s first quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer and Dennis Koehl, Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer.  Today we plan to cover our first quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. You’ll notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. First quarter 2011 ongoing earnings were $0.42 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2010. First quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were also $0.42 per share compared with $0.36 per share in 2010. While there was no difference between GAAP and ongoing earnings in 2011, during the first quarter of 2010 ongoing earnings excluded the impact of adjustments related to the discontinued COLI program and adjustments associated with Medicare Part D subsidies. Management believes ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energy’s fundamental core earnings power. As a result, we will only discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G. S. Fowke III:  Thank you and good morning. As Paul mentioned, we reported first quarter ongoing earnings of $0.42 per share compared with $0.42 per share in 2010. I’m pleased to report that in addition to delivering a solid quarter financially, we continue to execute on our strategy. This morning I’ll focus my prepared comments on three items of current interest; our decision to terminate the Merricourt Wind project, our preliminary take on EPA’s proposed MACT rules and the depth of our safeguards at our nuclear operations.  Earlier this month we terminated our argument with enXco for the development of the 150-megawatt Merricourt Wind Project in North Dakota. This was slated to be a $400 million project going into service in late 2011. We terminated the agreement because the project did not close by the contractual closing date and certain conditions required for closing were not satisfied. These conditions included a failure to resolve concerns about potential adverse consequences the project could have on two endangered species and a failure to obtain the Certificate of Site Compatibility. Given the uncertainty around the timing, cost and prospects for resolving these issues, we concluded it was in the best interest of our customers to terminate our agreement for this project based on our contractual rights. As a result of this decision, all of our investment in the project has been refunded. We are now forecasting 2011 capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. We’ve also updated our Rider revenue guidance for 2011 to reflect the termination of this agreement. We remain interested in owning additional wind capacity and we are evaluating wind ownership opportunities in North Dakota.  Turning to the recently proposed EPA rules, last month the EPA issued their proposed MACT rules addressing emission. Like many of our peers, we are in the process of evaluating what if any impact they may have on our operations. Based on our preliminary review we do not anticipate that the rule will require extensive changes to our plans at NSP and PSCo. Our proactive steps to reduce emissions through the MERP project in Minnesota and our plans for the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act in Colorado put us in good position to comply with these rules. The proposed rules may have a significant impact on our facilities at SPS. However, at this point we do not anticipate a material change to our five-year CapEx forecast. Lastly, I’ll comment on the safety of our nuclear fleet. In response to the recent events of Fukushima nuclear plants, all U.S. nuclear power plants including our Prairie Island in Minnesota have assessed their capability to maintain safety in the face of sever adverse events including the loss of significant operational and safety systems. Nuclear power plants are built to withstand environmental hazards including earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. Even plants like ours that are located outside of areas with extensive seismic activity are designed for safety in the events of such a natural disaster. As either of our plants experience in adverse events, our normal safety systems will keep the reactor core cool. We have two diesel generators for each unit, each one capable supplying power to meet all the safety related needs for that unit should the plant be disconnected from the power grid. In addition, our fuel tanks are stored and sealed below ground, which protects them from natural disasters. Should diesel generators fail, our facilities are equipped with battery backups systems. In addition, we have pumps that are driven by steam turbine that do not depend on electricity. In the unlikely event that none of the normal and backup safety systems were available to keep the reactor core cool, we have potable pumps that could be hoped up to supply cooling water into the reactor from the Mississippi River. Finally, our plans have multiple sources of getting water into the core. For example, our Minnesota plant has eight independent ways to get water into the core during an emergency, while our Prairie Island plant has nine independent ways to get water into the core. In summary, we believe the design of our plants, their geographic location and the robust nature of our systems significantly reduce the likelihood of an emergency on the scale experienced to Japan. And as said, there are always lessons learned from a disaster. We are participating in an industry-working group. The groups’ focus will center on understanding the events that occurred at Fukushima and recommending actions to improve the ability of U.S. plants to withstand similar events. In the meantime, we continue to work to complete the life extension on our Prairie Island plant and our plant power operates at both Minnesota and Prairie Island. We anticipate the timeframe may be delayed a bit but we don't anticipate any material changes to our plants. I’ll now turn the call over to Dave, who will walk you through our first quarter results and provide the regulatory update. Dave?
David M. Sparby: Thanks, Ben. Now let's take a look at the details of our first quarter results beginning with a review of each of our subsidiaries. For the quarter, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.03 per share due to the impact of lower seasonal rates as well as higher O&M expenses, property tax and depreciation expense. These expense increases were partially driven by capital investments made in 2010 including Comanche 3 and the natural gas plants we acquired in Colorado. At NSP Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.04 per share due to interim rate increases in Minnesota, North Dakota as well as moderate sales growth and colder weather. The positive items were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, property tax and depreciation expense. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin and SPS were both flat for the quarter. Next, I’ll discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement beginning with retail, electric margin. Our first quarter electric margin increased by $90 million driven by two primary items. Retail rate increases in Colorado, Texas and Wisconsin along with interim rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota increased electric margin by $34 million.  The impact of rate increases was partially offset by the impact of lower seasonal electric rates in Colorado. Electric margin also increased by $34 million due to recovery of the revenue requirements associated with PSCo’s acquisition of two natural gas facilities in late 2010. Please note that the increase in revenue requirements was partially offset by expenses such as higher O&M depreciation and property taxes. Increased rider, conservation and DSM revenue as well as increased sales and weather also contributed to the quarterly improvement in electric margin. Natural gas margins increased $13 million in the first quarter due primarily to increased conservation and DSM revenue, which is partially offset by expenses. In addition, colder than normal weather also helped to offset a modest sales decrease. Turning to expenses; first quarter O&M expenses increased about $29 million or about 6%, this was driven by several items including higher employee benefit expenses related to pension, higher labor cost, as well as higher plant generation and nuclear plant generation cost. We expect that O&M expense will increase up to 4% in 2011. The quarterly increase is slightly higher than our annual guidance largely due to the timing of O&M expenses.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased about $19 million or 9%. This increase is consistent with our expectations and was driven by several plants coming online in 2010 including Comanche 3, the Nobles Wind Farm and the acquisition of two natural gas plants. Finally other taxes increased approximately $15 million or 19% largely due to increased property tax from capital projects going into service primarily in Minnesota and Colorado. Next I’ll discuss our 2011 financing plans. We have updated our plants to reflect the 2011 capital expenditure forecast of approximately $2 billion. As a result, we no longer plan to issue first mortgage bonds at NSP in Minnesota this year. The rest of our financing plans remain unchanged. In addition to periodic issuance and repayment of short-term debt, we plan to issue the following securities. Approximately $250 million to first mortgage bonds at PSCo during the second half of 2011  SPS may issue approximately $150 million of bonds during the summer of 2011, and we anticipate issuing approximately $75 million of equity through Xcel Energy strip and various benefit programs in 2011. Naturally, our financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors. Lastly I’ll provide an update on the rate cases that are currently underway in our various jurisdictions. In Minnesota, we have a pending electric case seeking a 2011 rate increase of a $148 million based on a 2011 forecast test year. 11.25% ROE, rate base of $5.6 billion and a 52.6% equity ratio. Interim rates of $123 million subject to refund went into effect in January. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by an additional $48 million for known and measurable cost increases.  Earlier this month, Intervener’s filed direct testimony. The primary Intervener, the office of energy security, recommended an increase of approximately $57 million for 2011 based on a recommended ROE of 10.53% and an equity ratio of 52.6% they also recommended an additional $34 million rate increase for 2012. While the overall recommendation was lower than anticipated, we plan to file a better testimony next month in which we will provide additional support for our position and adjust our request as appropriate. We are confident that we can work to many other more complex issues such as income tax adjustments and pension costs, which represent a large portion of the difference. We anticipated a decision from the Minnesota commission in the fourth quarter. In Colorado, we have a $26 million gas request pending. The requested is based on a 2011 forecast test year at 10.9% ROE and an equity ratio of 57%. In April Intervener’s filed testimony and we were disappointed by the recommendations. The Staff recommended a rate decrease of $20 million based on a historical test year, a 9.375% ROE and a hypothetical capital structure within equity ratio of 51.8%. Next month we’ll file rebuttal testimony in which we’ll provide a significant amount of additional support for our position on a number of issues, including the cost of capital. Ultimately we expect to reach constructive outcome. In North Dakota we are requesting a $20 million electric rate increase. Interim rates of $17.4 million went into effect in February. Intervener testimony is scheduled for June and Rebuttal testimony in July and anticipate a decision later in 2011. At SPS we filed an electric rate case in New Mexico, seeking an annual base rate increase of $20 million. Notably the rate filing is based on 2011 test year adjusted known and measurable changes for 2012. Rates are expected to be effective in early 2012. In Texas the Commission approved our settlement, which provided for an overall increase of $23 million in 2011 and a stepping increase of $13 million for 2012. While there is still work to be done we continue to make progress at SPS. Looking ahead, we’re required to file an electric and gas rate case in Wisconsin early in June. We’ll update you on this request during our second quarter conference call. You may have noticed that we have adjusted some of our key guidance assumptions in our earnings release. Specifically we reduced our rider revenue depreciation and interest expense assumptions to reflect the cancellation of the Merricourt project. The overall impact is a reduction in EPS of about $0.02 per share for 2011. However, we’ve had another solid quarter and remain on track to deliver earnings within our annual earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. With that, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of James Bellessa with D.A Davidson. Please go ahead.
Michael Bates – D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning, guys. This is Michael Bates through Jim. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments, Dave, about your taxes other than income taxes. It’s higher because you brought on new capital projects. But is the $96.6 million level that we saw in the first quarter a good kind of run rate going forward, was there anything that you thought irregular about that?
David M. Sparby: Hi. Property tax rates may creep up throughout the year, I mean, what we have seen is primarily attributable of course to property additions, but all of the counties we serve of course are continuously evaluating their property tax rates. And it is possible that we could see some additional creep towards the end of the year.
Michael Bates – D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks guys.
David M. Sparby: Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And I’m showing no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
David M. Sparby: Yes. I want to thank everyone for attending the call this morning. If there is any follow-up questions, please direct them to our IR team. Thank you very much for attending.

Operator: Welcome to the Xcel Energy fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded today, January 27, 2011. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy's yearend 2010 earnings release conference call. I am Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today we plan to cover our 2010 yearend quarter results, provide a business update and reaffirm our 2011 guidance. Please note there are slides that accompany the conference call which are available on our web page. I want to remind you that some of the comments that we make today will contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. You'll note that today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. 2010 ongoing earnings per share were $1.62 compared with $1.50 per share in 2009. 2010 GAAP earnings per share were $1.62 compared with $1.48 in 2009. We believe that ongoing earnings, which remove the impact of our discontinued company-owned life insurance program, Medicare Part D and discontinued operations provide a meaningful comparison. As a result we will discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see our earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and ongoing earnings results. I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Paul, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to announce that Xcel Energy enjoyed another successful year. I'll touch on few of the highlights and Dave will discuss our detailed results in a few moments. As Paul just mentioned, we reported 2010 ongoing earnings of $1.62 per share compared with a $1.50 per share in 2009. We feel good about delivering earnings results in the upper half of our 2010 earnings guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share. This marks the sixth consecutive year that we've met or exceeded our annual earnings objective. We were also successful in meeting other financial objectives. We raised the annual dividend $0.03 or 30% to $1.01 per share, and our credit ratings also improved, as S&P raised its rating on Xcel Energy and three of our operating companies by one notch. In a year where we experienced hot weather throughout our system, I am proud that we maintained our system integrity and once again delivered a high level of customer service. We achieved a customer satisfaction rating of 92% for the third consecutive year. In 2010, we completed two major construction projects: Comanche 3, an 800-megawatt coal plant in Colorado; and Nobles, a 201-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota. We also began construction on the CapX2020 transmission project. In addition, we finalized the purchase of two natural gas plants in Calpine. This asset acquisition will save our customers' money in the long run and will also be accretive to 2011 earnings. We were able to finance this transaction and other components of our growth strategy by raising $1.9 billion in the debt and equity market at very attractive rates. Lastly, I'll provide a few comments regarding the Clean Air Clean Jobs Act in Colorado. In December, the Colorado Commission approved a plan for PSCO to reduce annual emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 70% to 80%. The plan is designed to achieve this goal through a combination of retiring older, less efficient coal plants, returning to natural gas and installing emission controls by 2017. The primary difference between our recommendation and the CPUC approved plan has to do with Cherokee Unit 4. Under the approved plan, we will fuel switch Cherokee Unit 4 to natural gas. The Commission also provided for a recovery on construction work in progress and future rate cases. In addition, they incurred stakeholder meetings to discuss a multiyear rate plan. In January, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission approved the cooperation of the Clean Air Clean Jobs plan into Colorado's Regional Haze State Implementation Plan. Next in the process, the Colorado legislature must approve the State Implementation Plan. Upon legislative approval, the State Implementation Plan will be sent to the Governor for his signature. Our total investment for the plan is estimated to be approximately $1 billion over the next seven years and is expected to increase customer bills on an average by about 2% annually. I think this is another great example of our ability to work with key stakeholders to arrive at a creative solution to reduce emission while ensuring timely recovery of cost. In summary, this was a really great year for us. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Sparby who will walk you through our results and provide a regulatory update.
Dave Sparby: Thanks, Ben. Let's now take a look at details of 2010 starting with a review of the annual financial results at each of our operating companies. Earnings at PSCO increased by $0.14 per share in 2010. The increase was largely due to new electric rates in warmer summer temperatures, partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. At NSP-Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.04 per share for the year, largely due to higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by warmer temperatures, incentives under our conservation programs and weather-normalized sales growth. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin decreased $0.01 per share due to fuel recovery and higher O&M expenses, partially offset by warmer-than-normal temperatures and the implementation of new electric rates. Earnings increased $0.02 per share at SPS due to electric sales growth, the reversal of previously established fuel cost allocation reserves and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher O&M expenses. Now, I'd like to discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement, beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased by $408 million for the year. Approximately $228 million of the improvement in electric margin was due to the implementation of new rates in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico. Warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2010 compared with cooler-than-normal temperatures last year resulted in a $65 million improvement in electric margin. Conservation and DSM revenue, which is partially offset by expenses, contributed $72 million of the improvement. Finally, retail sales, adjusted for weather and the sale of our Lubbock distribution assets, increased 1.4% and contributed $18 million of improvement in margin. Other factors that had a smaller impact on 2010 electric margin are detailed in our earnings release. Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $20 million for the year. The increase was driven primarily by conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. In addition, we implemented new rates in Minnesota. Higher costs partially offset the increases in electric and gas margin. We are investing significant levels of capital, which is growing rate base 7% annually. As you'd expect, this is resulting in additional O&M, depreciation and interest expense. In 2010, our O&M expenses increased $149 million or about 8%. As a reminder, we decided to invest additional O&M in our generation, transmission and distribution system after a summer of prolonged hot weather. We made those investments to ensure that our customer service and reliability remain at levels our customers have come to expect. Approximately $77 million or roughly one-half of the increase in 2010 O&M expenses came from higher plant generation, nuclear plant generation and nuclear outage costs. These costs increased as result of higher levels of maintenance and overhaul work, incremental operating costs associated with new facilities and increased security costs for nuclear plants. Other factors contributing to the increase in O&M expense included $24 million of higher labor cost, $18 million of higher contract labor cost, $15 million of higher employee benefit cost largely, due to rising pension cost, and other items on totaling an increase of $15 million. Looking ahead at 2011, we project our O&M expenses to increase approximately 4%. Now, also offsetting the improvement in margin, depreciation and amortization rose $41 million or about 5%. The increase was related to Comanche 3 going into service in the second quarter and our continued investment in our utility system. Turning to income taxes, our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations came in at 36.7% and was 160 basis points higher than last year. The effective tax rate experience from 2010 was due to the following items: the elimination of tax benefits from Medicare Part D subsidies and an adjustment related to the COLI Tax Court proceedings. Those items were partially offset by the reversal of evaluation allowance for certain state tax credit carryovers. We anticipate that our 2011 effective tax rate will be in the 34% to 36% range. Now, let me give you an update on our pending rate cases. In November, we filed a request at Minnesota to increase electric rates approximately $150 million or 5.6%. The filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year and 11.25% ROE, a rate base of $5.6 billion and a 52.6% equity ratio. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by an additional $48 million for known and measurable cost increases. Interim rates of $123 million subject to refund went into effective earlier this month. We anticipate a decision from the Minnesota Commission in the fourth quarter of 2011. In December, we filed a request to increase electric rates in North Dakota by approximately $20 million or 12%. The filing is based on a 2011 forecast test year, a requested of 11.25% and electric rate base of $328 million and an equity ratio of 52.6%. We also requested to increase 2012 rates by additional 4 million or 2.6% to recover certain known and measurable cost increases. In January, the North Dakota Commission approved our request for interim rates of approximately $17 million effective in February. We anticipate a decision from the North Dakota Commission in the fourth quarter of 2011. Now in December, we filed a request to increase Colorado retail natural gas rates by approximately $28 million. The request is based on a 2011 forecast test year, a 10.9% ROE, a rate base of $1.1 billion and an equity ratio of 57%. We anticipate a decision later this year with new rates effective this summer. In Texas, we have revised a request to increase electric rates by approximately $48 million on a net basis. The filing is based on a 2009 test year adjusted for known and measurable changes and 11.35% ROE, a rate base of a little over $1 billion and an equity ratio of 51%. We continue to work with the various parties on a potential settlement. Last week, on behalf of all parties, we filed a motion to abate the procedural schedule to allow time to complete settlement negotiations. The parties agree to set February 11 as a deadline to file a stipulation or a status report. Interim rates subject to refund or the ability to surcharge will be in effect in the middle of February. Looking ahead, we plan to file New Mexico electric and PSCO wholesale rate cases in the upcoming months. We will provide additional details on these cases as they become available. In summary, this was another great year for Xcel Energy. We delivered on our financial objectives. We maintained historically high levels of customer service. We met or exceeded our energy efficiency and conservation program target. We completed a forward equity sale and issued bonds at record low coupon levels. We completed construction projects on time and on budget. We acquired two natural gas plants. And we agreed to a comprehensive plan to invest $1 billion to reduce emissions in Colorado. Our efforts were also reflected in our stock price. For the third year in a row, shares of Xcel Energy outperformed our peer group of mid-to-large cap regulated utilities. When taking into account the reinvestment of our dividends, we delivered a total return of more than 16%. We expect continuing success in 2011 and are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. Please note there are modest adjustments to the earnings guidance assumptions included in our earnings release. These changes largely reflect our current information and 2010 actual results and will not have a material impact on our projected results. This concludes my prepared remarks. We are now ready for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question does come from the line of Michael Worms with BMO.
Michael Worms - BMO: Just a quick question for you. Can you talk a little bit about the political environment in Colorado? I believe I read somewhere some were talking about perhaps trying to reduce the renewable standard going forward.
Ben Fowke: There is a number of legislation that's been introduced in Colorado, and that's one of them. I think they want to roll it back. You may recall though that just last year the 30% standard got passed. So we really don't think that will be successful. I think one of those things we probably need to do a better job of, Michael, is communicating with all stakeholders, particularly with some of the controversy around Clean Air Clean Jobs, just how affordable renewables, particularly wind, in all our service territories are, because it hasn't cost customers' money. We think it's positioned us very well for the future, as you know. That's a long answer. The short answer is that we don't think it will pass.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: One of the changes in the assumptions was the interest expense decline. What's driving that? Is that lower rates or is that lower (inaudible).
Ben Fowke: It was the actual results reflecting our bond sale in Colorado plant.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And it looks like the Wisconsin debt issuance is no longer in the financing plans. Has something happened there?
Ben Fowke: No, it's just more recent information updating our models.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Ben, you talked a little bit about it, but what kind of controversy are we getting around Clean Air Clean Jobs? And do you think that's going to go in there?
Ben Fowke: I think it'll pass. I think the controversy is really kind of localized in our service territory that are mining. And as you know, the Act itself had a bit of a controversy nationally, the kind of a battleground for coal versus gas. And so I think we are seeing a little bit of the residual of that. We had to do something to meet the haze requirements. I think we did a very balanced plan. And I think when you look at the facts, we're still going to burn coal and we are going to modernize the infrastructure, which a lot of this is about, and address haze and other things. And we made a decision to put some pollution control equipment on more modern plant with the later vintage, but some of these plants that frankly go back to the ice and hot era and are right in the heart of the city, we just determine that it was better to re-power and use those sites, but go to gas and rebalance our portfolio. Last year, with Comanche 3 coming on, a very new modern plant at a price point, we burnt more than 70% of our energy in coal. So this allows us to rebalance the portfolio, modernize and do all the good things and I think at a very good price point for our customers. However, it is always the local few that aren't happy. And that's what I think you are seeing here.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And just separately, given that (inaudible) has involved the DEI, what's ceasing with regards to any action on how ETI views EPA's upcoming actions in potential for delays or what could be happening there?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think what Dick and the industry will concentrate on is trying to get a comprehensive and reasonably balanced approach to addressing some of the environmental regulations that are coming out. Whether that's delays or whether that's just moving to more of a system versus the plant-by-plant approach, I think as a group we are working to get consensus on that. What we don't want to see is an avalanche of regulations coming out with very tight timeframes and very low flexibility coming upon the industry at a time when that all just raised costs necessarily. So I think what Dick will try to do and what the industry will try to do is come out with a more sensible economically based plan to address some of the concerns. It won't be easy, Paul.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: I assume you had some preliminary discussions with EPA. Do you have a sense if there is any flexibility there? It sounds like they're still going to pretty rigid.
Ben Fowke: To the extent, they want some flexibility. I think it remains to be seen. I mean there is discussion, but there is nothing concrete I can point to at this point of call.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: You guys obviously have some good growth, especially in your guidance here coming up next year. Can you give us some idea of how much of that growth in your guidance estimate is AFUDC non-cash earnings and how much would be cash earnings from these rate increases that you've got proposed coming in from 2011 activity?
Ben Fowke: Travis, AFUDC is expected to be relatively flat in 2011. So really it's more a reflection of sales growth, rate increases, rider revenue, things like that.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: On the rider part, can you give us some idea of percentage contribution from rider?
Ben Fowke: Riders are expected to increase about $35 million in 2011.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: What was your actual earned ROE in 2010 compared to the authorized numbers right now?
Dave Sparby: Ali, at the operating company, they stretch from the mid-8s to over 10. At the holding company level, they are a little over 10 for 2010.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And the guidance you have for '11, what's kind of implied or embedded in that as far as ROEs are concerned?
Dave Sparby: We are anticipating fairly close to 10 at the holding company.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Not a significant improvement year-over-year?
Dave Sparby: Well, there is a little improvement I guess. I am factoring out the weather in that.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: So the numbers you quoted for '10 were not weather-normalized, those were actuals; and in '11 you're assuming normal weather? Is that the way to think about it?
Dave Sparby: Yes.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And then separately, the CapEx program that you guys have made out, a number of these EPA regulations are still coming down the pipe. Given your specific situation, how much variability do you think there is in that CapEx projection that you have depending on what the final EPA regulations across the board may come up? Is there much flexibility for you guys?
Dave Sparby: Ali, I think that our CapEx projections reflect the most expected outcome you appreciate going into this. We're well positioned. You saw in our report that we gave in December to all of our investors that we've anticipated most of the regulations as the industry expects them to be put in place over the next several years. We've also of course made significant investments in the past anticipating this. So although I think we could see, especially in later years, some variability, I think our CapEx as it reflects what we anticipate from EPA is probably pretty close.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: In your assumptions you've laid out, you've assumed equity of around $75 million for DRIP, et cetera. Looking at this CapEx program, can you just remind us again when do you think you would be in a position where you would start to need external equity beyond that?
Dave Sparby: What we said, Ali, is we don't need equity in 2011. As we approach the end of the year, we'll evaluate both market conditions as well as our CapEx requirements and we'll provide some additional guidance perhaps in that regard.
Ben Fowke: Ali, just to the point to it, the analyst meeting that we had in December, we laid out our five-year plan. And obviously CapEx is modified a little bit. But over that five-year timeframe, we kind of anticipate that they might be up to $800 million of just common equity, excluding the DRIP program.
Dave Sparby: That's in '11 through '15, and it's in the slides I have presented, Ali.
Ben Fowke: Yes, Ali, it's one of the reasons why rate base grows faster than our long-term earnings growth range.
Dave Sparby: And the dividend plan is still the same, which will be slightly lower than EPS growth.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: How consistent would you like to say?
Ben Fowke: It's been steady and consistent as you know.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management: Could you just remind us when is the next Colorado rate filing expected?
Ben Fowke: Well, Ashar, we're currently in a gas case right now and the Commission has required that we file before April 2012. That's all the guidance I can provide to you at this time.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities.
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities: Just an update on the High Plains Express, because I think there was a study recently conducted out in the west. It wasn't clear whether they had any implications on the timing of High Plains. So let's hear your latest thoughts on High Plains. Is this still looking at second half of the decade or is there a chance that we could see some capital flow in the next five years? And a follow-up on that is does your current five-year capital forecast include any CapEx for High Plains.
Ben Fowke: I'll kick it off and see if Dave or Scott want to add anything. Our five-year forecast doesn't include anything. I think High Plains is probably going to be in the study mode for quite a while. So I don't anticipate that we'll have them in our forecast anytime soon.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: You seem to have a little downtick in residential usage normalized in the fourth quarter? Give us some insights into that and then maybe marry it together with decision to slightly bump the sales forecast for 2011.
Dave Sparby: First of all, your observation is correct. There was a little bit of a downtick in residential in the fourth quarter. Some of the economists here, Jonathan, have suggested that the consumer is seeing some increases in CPI, but yet the unemployment rate is staying pretty steady. So although they are paying about 15% more for things like gasoline, there really hasn't been any more jobs. And that's probably one of the better explanations, which is a little bit of softness at the end of the year residentially. Now, we do feel better going into 2011 about the economy than we did in 2010. Those industries that were the best performing sectors in 2010 continue to be strong in 2011. There is a little bit of uptick possibly there, but we are seeing some recovery in a couple of sectors of manufacturing also. So we are slightly more optimistic in 2011 about the economy than we were in 2010.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: Could you maybe give us a bit more of a regional sense of what you're seeing across the service territory and where that bullishness is a bit of more pronounced?
Dave Sparby: The sales have been a little bit stronger from south to north and from west to east. So we see most of our sales growth in, for example, Texas where the energy sector has been very strong. We've seen sales growth not quite as strong, but strong in Colorado where we've seen not only some energy, but also some mining, for example, that we expect to pick up. And although Minnesota, which is a bit of anomaly, has one of the lowest unemployment rates, sales have been slow. And it's partially because we have a much more diversified economy here, including things like food and agriculture services, which have started to look like they'll trend up, have just come to stabilize here in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dudack Research.
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research: I was interested in your detailed O&M and especially the 4% increase you anticipate for this year. Is it because of conscious cost control relative to 2010? And do you think that 4% is a trend, or is this just because of timing?
Dave Sparby: When you look at that 4%, you have to keep in mind, as Ben has talked about, the amount of plant that we've been adding over time. And you look at 2011 and it'll be the first full year of Calpine. It is a partial year of additional expense for Comanche. We've got a full year of Nobles here. And together, that's more than $20 million just to serve the additional generation plant. Now, we've got about $20 million of additional in benefits as a result of pension expense, and of course there is about $20 million in labor increase component on top of that. So the 4% is pretty easily explainable. When you take out the new plant, it's less than 3%.
Ben Fowke: It really reflects to what we think our trend line would be going forward. I mean to Dave's point, we were increasing rate base. We're putting money into the infrastructure, doing the things I think our stakeholders want us to do.
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research: So you can stick to that 4% to 5% rate over time as well?
Ben Fowke: It's what we've been doing over the last five years basically. But I think what you're driving at is it takes a lot of productivity improvements to keep it there. And that's what we work on.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Dan Jenkins with The State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
Dan Jenkins - The State of Wisconsin Investment Board: The first question I had is related to your Texas electric case, which you expect rates to be effective here pretty soon. Given that you are in settlement discussions, what's kind of the range, U.S. for $48 million? As far as the parties you're in discussion with, what were their last proposals?
Dave Sparby: We can't discuss settlement negotiations. They've filed no testimony at this point.
Ben Fowke: I think we are making progress.
Scott Wilensky: Yes, we are making progress. We've actually filed with DoJ to set a date to either file a settlement February 11 or to obey procedural schedule. We think we'll be on target for that. And we'll share the results of that. But in this case, it's not they're trying to work forward with the settlement without the testimony in those stated position, as you were looking for us. So we don't have that lower benchmark.
Dan Jenkins - The State of Wisconsin Investment Board: How about the staff today? Do you have a final position?
Scott Wilensky: No party, including staff, actually has filed the testimony, staking out their position. Everybody concluded it will be more productive to work towards this settlement prior to doing that.
Dan Jenkins - The State of Wisconsin Investment Board: What was the customer growth for 2010? What did you use for your budget as far as customer growth for 2011?
Dave Sparby: The customer growth for 2010 was about 35,000 customers. That's electric and gas. It's about six-tenth of 1%. And for 2011, it's just a little bit better than that.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question does come from the line of James Bellessa of D.A. Davidson and Company.
James Bellessa - D.A. Davidson and Company: Quarterly PSCO earning per share were down about 4% due largely to the newly enacted and lower seasonal rates. Do you expect that same pattern to occur, that same type of earning decline in the first quarter because of the same influence?
Ben Fowke: Yes.
James Bellessa - D.A. Davidson and Company: And my research partner, Mike Bates, has a question.
Mike Bates - D.A. Davidson and Company: You guys have given some commentary on this in the past is that your conservation and DSM expenses, which we understand are recovered in your riders. It seems think like you've said that you expect the rate of the increase to taper off herein. Can you give a little bit of commentary on what you expect for that line item this year and going forward?
Dave Sparby: Well, we've had a very successful year of course this past year with DSM and conservation reflected figures. In prior years, we finished the year about 1.3% savings, for example, in Minnesota. We do expect this coming year to be about the same; however, there'll be probably some additional programs that we'll see in other jurisdictions. So what we'll see is probably an increase this year, but it will not be as significant as we saw from 2009 through 2010.
Ben Fowke: I think the one thing to keep in mind too is that the bar increases for us as the incentive mechanisms that come with that do as well. So it's very much a part of our business. I think it's a reason why customer satisfaction is high. And I think our customers appreciate it. But every year, the challenge gets a little bit greater.
Dave Sparby: That is the bar gets raised.
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn it back over to Dave Sparby for any closing comments.

Operator: Welcome to the Xcel Energy’s Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded, Thursday, 28 October, 2010. I’d now like to hand the conference over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy’s third quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today we plan to cover our third quarter results, provide a business update and introduce 2011 guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Third GAAP earnings for 2010 include $25 million or $0.05 per share of non-reoccurring earnings related to the settlement of a lawsuit with Provident Insurance Company regarding our discontinued company owned life insurance program COLI. Our comments this morning will focus on ongoing earnings; a reconciliation of ongoing earnings per share to GAAP earnings per share is available in our press release. I will now turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Paul and good morning. Today we reported third quarter ongoing earnings of $0.62 per share compared with $0.48 per share in 2009. The increase in our quarterly results was largely due to warm weather, late release and the implementation of seasonal rates. As a result, we now expect our 2010 ongoing earnings to be in the upper half of $1.55 to $1.65 per share guidance range. Compared to last year, third quarter earnings increased $0.09 per share due to weather. You might recall that we experienced an unusually cool third quarter last year, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. This year we experienced warmer than normal temperatures, which helped increase earnings by $0.04 per share. The warmer temperatures also produced severe weather throughout our service territory including flooding in Minnesota and Wisconsin and a significant increase in lightning strikes in the twin cities. I am proud to note that we maintained our system integrity and delivered a high level of customer service despite the impact severe weather had on our system. Residential customer satisfaction ended the quarter at 92%, which is above our goal for 2010. Our ability to maintain a high level of customer service during the quarter is attributable to our long-standing commitment to make investments in our system. Let me bring you up-to-date on some recent developments. In Colorado, interveners filed testimony to our recommended plan to comply with the Colorado Clean Air, Clean Jobs Act. Our plan must consider emission control, plant refueling or plant retirement of at least 900 megawatts of coal-fired generation. We analyzed numerous alternatives and scenarios and came up with our preferred plan based on a balanced approach to reduce emissions at the lowest cost to our customers. Our recommended plan would retire about 900,000 megawatts of coal generation, repower with approximately 890 megawatts of natural gas generation and install pollution control equipment on another 950 megawatts of coal generation. Last week Colorado Commission decided that our preferred plan did not meet the legislation’s deadline for full implementation by the end of 2017. This decision affects our preferred plan specifically the proposal to retire the fourth unit at Cherokee and replace it with a new natural gas fired combined cycle unit by 2022. In response to the Commission’s decision we filed an alternative plan, which we feel is the next best option. The alternative plan would retrofit instead of retire Cherokee’s fourth unit with highly efficient pollution control equipment. Overall, the alternative plan would still retire approximately 550 megawatts of coal-fired generation at Valmont and Cherokee. And once implemented, our alternative plan would reduce NOx emissions by 85% and enable us to meet Colorado’s carbon dioxide reduction goal of 20% by 2020. We estimate that customer bills would increase 1.7% annually to achieve these environmental improvements. We also studied an option to accelerate our preferred plan by five years and retire Cherokee unit 4 by 2017. Additionally we looked at an alternative to permanently switch Cherokee unit 4 to natural gas in 2017. Both of these options have a higher near-term impact on customer bills than our alternative plan but we have identified them for Commission's consideration. Ultimately, our proposed plan balanced significant environment benefits while minimizing the cost impact to our customers. We expect the Colorado Commission to issue a decision in mid-December. Also in Colorado we made great progress in our planned acquisition of two natural gas generating assets from Calpine. Last month we reached a partial settlement with the CPUC staff, the Colorado Independent Energy Association and the OCC prior to the case going to hearing. As part of the settlement, we agreed to reduce the annual revenue requirement by $3.9 million. In mid-October, the CPUC approved the acquisition purchase price and cost recovery settlement. We anticipate closing on this transaction in December. I will now turn the call over to Dave who will walk you through our third quarter results, provide a regulatory update and introduce our 2011 earnings guidance. Dave?
Dave Sparby: Thanks, Ben. Let’s start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings at PSCo increased $0.09 per share. The increase was due to a variety of factors including rate increases associated with the 2010 electric case, timing issues related to the implementation of seasonal rates and warmer than normal weather. As NSP-Minnesota, earnings increased by $0.04 per share largely due to warmer temperatures and weather normalized sales growth. Earnings at NSP-Wisconsin increased $0.01 per share due to warmer than normal temperatures and the implementation of new electric rates. Earnings were flat at SPS. Now I would like to discuss the drivers that affected the various lines of the income statement beginning with electric retail market. Electric margin increased $183 million for the quarter, warmer than normal temperatures this quarter compared to with cooler than normal temperatures last year, resulted in a $58 million improvement in electric margin. Electric margin also increased by $88 million for the Colorado rate cases, for the rates cases in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota, New Mexico and the implementation of seasonal rates. As part of the rate design portion of the Colorado rate case, seasonal rates were implemented this summer. Seasonal rates are designed to be revenue neutral on an annual basis with higher rates in the summer months and lower rates throughout other months of the year. As a result, revenue at PSCo is higher during the third quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate that impact of higher summer rates will be mitigated during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first half of 2011. As a result of the implementation timing of seasonal rates in the summer of 2010, we anticipate a positive impact this year. Other factors that improves third quarter electric margin are detailed in our earnings release. Before I leave electric margin, I want to point out that our sales continue to reflect a recovery in our service territory. Our year-to-date electric sales are up 1.4%. We now expect annual sales growth of approximately 1.2% to 1.4%, slightly above our original forecast of 1%. Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $6 million for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by interim rates in Minnesota and conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. Now offsetting some of the improvement in margins, third quarter O&M expenses increased by $43 million or 9%. Factors driving the third quarter increase in O&M expenses included $14 million for higher employee benefit costs related to performance-based incentive compensation and pension costs; $7 million of higher labor costs; $7 million of higher plan generation cost; $5 million of nuclear plant operation cost; and other items totaling $10 million. We continue to make the necessary investments in our system to maintain a high level of reliability, the warmer than normal summer temperatures provided additional margin. Therefore we decided to spend additional O&M to ensure continued system reliability and customer satisfaction. As a result, we now project our annual 2010 O&M increase to be between 8% and 9%, which is above our original guidance of an increase of 6% to 7%. Also offsetting the improvement in margin, third quarter depreciation and amortization rose $23 million or 12%. The increase was related to Comanche 3 coming online in the second quarter and our continued investment in our utility system. We continue to forecast G&A to increase $35 million to $45 million in 2010. Turning to income taxes, our effective rate for the third quarter came in at 34.7% and was 320 basis points lower than the comparable period last year. The higher effective tax rate experienced during the third quarter of 2009 was due to the recognition of additional unitary taxed expense and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state tax carryovers that were set to expire. We continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the 35% to 37% range. Let’s move on to our recent financing activity. To date we have raised $1.5 billion to finance our growth strategy. With our stock trading near its 52-week high in early August, we sold almost 22 million shares of common stock to a forward equity agreement. This transaction covers our equity needs in 2010 and 2011 and captures the accretion of our anticipated acquisition of two natural gas plants from Calpine. We expect to physically deliver the shares of common equity in the fourth quarter to close out the forward agreement. Also, in August at NSP-Minnesota, we issued $250 million of five-yea first mortgage bonds at 1.95% and $250 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at 4.85%. These bonds set temporary records for the lowest coupons at the time. Now looking ahead, we plan to issue approximately $400 million of first mortgage bonds at PSCo before the end of the year. Now, let’s turn to an update of our pending rate cases. In Minnesota, we are currently seeking a gas rate increase of $10 million based on a 10.6 ROE. The case is coming to a conclusion and we anticipate a decision from the MPUC later this quarter. In Wisconsin, we recently filed an application with a public service commission requesting to reopen the 2010 rate case and increase electric rates by $29 million based on a 2011 test year. The requested increase is primarily related to production and transmission fixed charges. We anticipate a ruling by year end. In Texas, we filed for a $62 million electric rate increase last May. In September we filed an agreement with intervening parties to abate the original procedural schedule. As part of this agreement, interim rates will become effective in the middle of February 2011. If we cannot reach a settlement agreement in the coming months, the procedural schedule would begin with the intervener testimony in January 2011. Finally, we plan to file an electric rate case in Minnesota in early November with interim rates subject to refund going into effect in January 2011. We expect the commission will rule on this request in the fourth quarter of 2011. This case will be driven by continued capital investment in Minnesota and rising nuclear pension and medical cost. We are in the process of finalizing our filings and anticipate seeking a 2011 rate increase in the 5% to 7% range. We will provide your more details on the Minnesota rate case at our New York Analyst meeting in early December. Now before I turn the call over to you for questions, I have just a few more items. This morning we are introducing our 2011 ongoing earnings per share guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75. A list of the assumptions for our earnings guidance can be found in today’s press release. However, some of the key assumptions in drivers include constructive outcomes in all rate case proceedings, weather adjusted retail electric utility sales normalized with the planned sale of our Lubbock distribution asset to grow about 1%, O&M expenses to increase 3% to 4%, depreciation expense to increase $55 million to $65 million and common stock and equivalence will increase to 485 million shares reflecting the forward equity sales we entered into this summer. The 2011 guidance range is consistent with our long-term earnings growth target of 5% to 7%, whether you use the 2009 ongoing results or a normalized 2010 earnings as the base. In summary, this was another greater quarter for Xcel Energy. We delivered strong earnings, enjoyed better than expected sales, completed a forward equity sale and issued bonds at record low coupon levels, maintained a high level of customer service, received commission approval for our acquisition of two natural gas plants, filed our recommended plant for the Colorado Clean-Air Clean Jobs Act and received a $25 million settlement in our COLI lawsuit. We’re pleased to be in a position to deliver 2010 ongoing earnings in the upper half of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and initiate 2011 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objectives. This concludes my remarks. We’re now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Ashar Khan (ph) with Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning Ashar.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Could you just help us at what kind of ROEs will you be – in your 2011 guidance, what kind of ROEs, could you go through each of the different sub ROE report, you report them. So what kind of ROEs will they be earning at each of the subs in 2011?
Dave Sparby: We don’t provide guidance by sub ROEs Ashar.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay, but generally what kind – could you give us a weighted average ROE that you expect to be in 2011?
Dave Sparby: Well the weighted average we expect this year is about to earn just slightly over 10%.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay, and next year?
Dave Sparby: Next year we should be expecting to do about that or slightly better.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Or slightly better. And how much and what would be your weighted average allowed ROEs, how much is there for regulatory lag between the two?
Dave Sparby: We’re earning about that 10.5% or seeing about 10.5% on a weighted average today from commissions and it’s been gradually sort of moving down a little bit throughout the year.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay, so you’re pretty much the regulatory lag as we look at ‘011 it’s pretty much eliminated as we look at 2011?
Ben Fowke: Ashar, this is Ben. I hope you’re doing well. But keep in mind that we talk about a consolidated ROE that also includes the holding company as well. So despite the regulatory improvements we continue to make, regulatory lag in this – the years to come or we’re going to spend, spending significant capital is something that we’ll continue to have to address. And we have plans to do that but we still have I would consider significant lag between authorized versus earned ROEs, so that’s opportunities for improvement obviously.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: And that would be what Ben around, what do you say 50 basis points or so?
Ben Fowke: I think it depends on the year Ashar. So it really depends but I would say 50 at minimum.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay, and then can I just ask you, what are the rate cases should we expect, do we expect a Minnesota filing pretty soon or would support the ‘011 guidance or what?
Dave Sparby: Yes, Ashar I think you should expect a Minnesota case and a case in North Dakota as well as a New Mexico all being filed at the end of either this year or at the beginning of next year. Now well there would also be some smaller cases PSCo wholesale case for example that will filed as well as a PSCo gas case over the course of next year.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay and then if I can just think this guidance range, sorry the earnings long-term growth rate with the Colorado Clean-Air expenditures, I guess they get approved and get finalized. Does it allow you to go towards the higher end of that range or no?
Dave Sparby: Well the expenditures are over a long period of time Ashar, and there is several other projects. There maybe some of those years where likely to be in the upper half of that range but over the six or seven years of construction, they’ll also be some years where we’re in that 5% to 6% range.
Ashar Khan – Visium Asset Management: Okay, thank you so much.
Dave Sparby: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hi Angie.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Research: Two questions, one the pickup in O&Ms that we’re seeing in 2010. Are these O&Ms that were simply deferred since ‘09, are you just simply trying to use the weather – favorable weather in this year to move some expenses forward from 2011?
Dave Sparby: Well Angie, there is a couple of pockets there. Some of these expenses it made sense to accelerate while we were in an area doing pole replacement for example. We took advantage of opportunities to do some of that work that was also included for 2011. We also did some plan for some heat related and reliability related maintenance where it made sense, particularly if that related to for example on NERC standard. So what we tried to do, we did have a little bit more flexibility this year with some margin. We looked at the work that we were intending to accomplish, how we could maximize that and that’s what our plan reflected.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Research: Okay. And then also you have – you mentioned your financing activities now it seems like you have that debts, pretty expensive debt maturing over the next two years. How should we think of it, if you refinance it assuming that the current interest rate environment doesn’t change? Do you expect that you would be able to retain the lower interest expense and the lower coupons for your shareholders, so do you think that you would give it up in future and upcoming rate cases?
Paul Johnson: Angie, this is Paul Johnson. We do have a couple of bonds maturing in 2012 at NSP-Minnesota and PSCo that have high coupons in the 7% to 8% range. Those bonds do include a make whole provision which makes it not economical to call them early. So we don’t intent to do that at this point in time. However, when we do get around a refinancing those bonds, obviously we expect that we’d be able to issue coupons in a much lower rate particular with our improved credit ratings and would expect that those savings would be passed on to rate peers when we file the rate cases and provide a lot of benefit to customers.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Research: Okay. The last question is the rates cases you mentioned, the filings in Minnesota and North Dakota and New Mexico. Would that impact 2011 results as far as Minnesota has interim rights. Is that correct?
Dave Sparby: Minnesota has interim rights and North Dakota does have some.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. Good morning.
Dave Sparby: Good morning.
Ben Fowke: Good morning.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Did I hear Ben or Dave correctly that the forward equity sale essentially takes care of your equity needs for ‘10 and ‘011. So in 2012, you may relook and see if there is need for new equity. Is that correct?
Dave Sparby: Yes, and as we approach 2012 we’ll take another look at where our requirements are.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And then the ‘011 guidance range the $1.65 to $1.75, now that assumes normal weather. So is the range essentially going to be driven by outcome of rate cases or where else would you see the Delta there?
Ben Fowke: Well of course Ali its always affected by rate cases but it’s also going to be affected by the economy and some of the other fundamentals of course that impact our guidance annually.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay and to declare the Colorado Clear-Air Act expenditures, as they ramp up as I recall over some years, do they already factored in to that range or would they be incremental assuming you get the approval by the end of the year. Where do they fit into the ‘011 numbers?
Dave Sparby: Well there is very little impact if any on 2011 resulting from Clean-Air Clean Jobs Ali.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Right, the ramp up happens what ‘12 through ‘16 or something like that, right?
Dave Sparby: Yes.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, and last question more near-term, you’ve guided us towards the higher end of the range for this year. I would imagine the results through the first nine months, how far above plan are you so far, given the help from the weather etcetera?
Ben Fowke: Well, right now, we’re looking to be right in the – in that top half of the guidance, Ali. I mean, we’ve had some – as we talked about several factors, we’ve had to see the impact of seasonal rates, we’ve seen the impact of some increased O&M fourth quarter. So we looked to be right within the top half of our guidance range.
Dave Sparby: Ali, if you look at where we think we’re going end the year, if you normalize it for the ins and the outs and weather, I mean it’s probably about in the middle of that guidance range. So we’re enjoying obviously the benefit of weather, but we’re also making the commitments to our – to reinvest and to keep investing in our system, and when we have warm weather we do that. And as I said in my remarks, I think the fact that we kind of have that strategy, it is why our reliability continues to be very strong and customer satisfaction is very high, which is always a good place to be when we’re going to be asking for the rate relief for the years to come. So I think our strategy works.
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Understood, thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dudack Research. Please go ahead.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Thank you. I was wondering seasonal rates, I didn’t catch, how much did that improve your earnings for the third quarter?
Ben Fowke: About $43 million, Daniele.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Okay, okay. And am I supposed to be assuming that half of that will be taken out in this fourth quarter?
Ben Fowke: About 40% or so. Yes, almost half.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Okay, okay. And when you’re talking about the Colorado Clean Act and your plan, it seems that the numbers are not exactly precise yet or do you know about how much it will cost for the period 2012 to 2014?
Ben Fowke: Daniele, it’s – you’re right. The numbers aren’t precise yet, it’s still in hearing. The commission will decide on the very specific plan in December.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Okay. And your total number when you filed was roughly how much? I mean, was there a number to it?
Ben Fowke: The number including the improvements in gas through 2022 was about $1.4 billion.
Dave Sparby: Daniele we included in the press release what the expenditures would be through 2017 under our recommended plan. Now, depending on what plan the commission fix, that will change a bit. And most likely what will happen is, expenditures that we haven’t targeted in ‘22, some of those would most likely be accelerated into a more near-term timeframes through 2017. But more to come at today’s point.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Okay. So the timing is more of the essence at this point than the amount per se.
Dave Sparby: It will be a little bit of both. But I mean again it depends on what plan the commission fix. And the issue there as you know is that the commission interpreted the legislation is everything having to be fully implemented by 2017. Our preferred plan extended the Cherokee Unit 4 plant to 2022, so we’ll see some changes with that.
Daniele Seitz – Dudack Research: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Yee with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hi. The $88 million electric margin increase that you saw due to rate increases and seasonal timing, do you have a split on how much was between the two and how much of that you would expect to reverse in the fourth quarter due to timing?
Ben Fowke: Yes, about $43 million of it was related to seasonal rates, the rest rate increases. As we talked about 40% or so of the seasonal rates will reverse out over this quarter. The rest will reverse out of course over the next couple of quarters in next.
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. And then, just to follow-up on the Cherokee Unit, about how much of those costs if the commission decides to go with the plan in 2017 would that be accelerated I guess from the 2022 timeframe?
Ben Fowke: About $150 million.
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great, thank you very much.
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I am showing no further questions in queue. I’ll hand it back to management for any further remarks.
Ben Fowke: Well, I want to thank all of you for participating in our third quarter earnings call this morning. We look forward to meeting with many of you at EEI next week. In addition, I hope you’ll join us at the New York Stock Exchange on December 1st for our Annual Investor Meeting. If you have any follow-up questions, the IR team is available to take your calls.

Operator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2010 Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 29, 2010.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's second quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. I'm Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today we plan to cover our second quarter results and provide a general business updates. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of our comments may contain forward looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. GAAP earnings for 2010 include a $0.01 per share benefit from discontinued operations, largely due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Our comments this morning will focus on ongoing earnings which do not include discontinued operation. A reconciliation of ongoing earnings per share to GAAP earnings per share is available in our press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Ben Fowke. 
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Paul and welcome everyone. This morning we reported second quarter ongoing earnings of $0.29 per share compared with $0.25 per share in 2009. In a few moments Dave will walk you through the details of our quarterly results. But I'd like to start by saying after two strong quarters we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our 2010 earnings guidance range of $1.25 to $1.65. Now let me bring you up today on some recent developments. In Colorado I'm pleased to report that (inaudible) went into service in May and achieve commercial operation earlier this month. The plant is certified at 802 net megawatts, which is above the expected output before 750 megawatts. I'm also pleased to note we continue to make solid progress on our CapEx 20-20 transmission project with construction now underway at our (inaudible) substation. In July, we received two of the five route permits needed in Minnesota for the project. Minnesota commission approved our application for the first segment of the Fargo line and for all but one section of the bookings line associated with the river crossing.  We believe that we will be able to reach an agreement regarding this section, soon. Obviously, it takes a long time to build transmission lines and we've been very successful in all aspects of the process. It's really exciting to see construction actually begin. Another development that promises to benefit our customers is our plan to acquire two natural gas plants from Calpine for approximately $739 million. In May we filed a request with the Colorado Commission seeking approval of the acquisition and interim rate recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the plants. In July we received FERT regulatory approval of the transaction and the order imposes no conditions or modifications, other than routine requirements for post closing reports and filings. We've also received clearance into the Hart-Scott-Todino act. The Colorado Commission assigned an administrative law judge to our case and developed a procedural schedule which assumes a initial decision by the end of October. This is consistent with our request and puts us on track for a December closing. One more update from Colorado. The clean air, clean jobs act was signed into law, in April. The bill establishes a timeline and a regulatory framework for PSCo to retrofit retire or replace 900 megawatts or more of older and less efficient coal fire generation. The provisions of the bill are very similar to the successful Merck project we finished last year in Minnesota. We will file our plan with the Colorado PUC in mid August, and the commission will rule on the plan by year-end. Our plan will include several potential alternatives, and our recommended solution. In light of the recent EPA proposals recording coal fire generation, the Colorado legislation is just another example of our ability to work with key stake holders to arrive at a creative solution to reduce emissions while ensuring timely recovery of cost. I will now turn the call over to Dave, who will walk you through our second quarter results, discuss our financing plans, and provide a regulatory update.
Dave Sparby: Thanks, Ben. Let's start by reviewing second quarter results at each of our subsidiaries. Earnings, at (inaudible) increased $0.04 per share largely due to the rate increases in electric sales growth. Keep in mind PSCo's 2010 earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date periods reflect rate increases from both 2009 and 2010 electric rate cases. New rates associated with the 2009 rate case went into effect in July 2009. As a result, improvement in PSCo's earnings in the second half of the year will be driven primarily from the 2010 rate increase. At (inaudible), earnings decreasing by $0.02 per share largely due to higher O&M costs which offset electric sales growth. At SPS, earnings increased $0.02 per share due to the resolution of fuel cost allocation issues, new rates that went into effect in New Mexico July 2009 in electric sales growth. And finally, earnings were flat for the quarter for NSP-Wisconsin. Now I would like to discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased $118 million for the quarter largely driven by rate increases in Colorado, and to a lesser extent south Dakota, New Mexico and Wisconsin. Together, these rate increases improved electric margin by $70 million. In addition to rate increases, other factors that improved second quarter electric margin included conservation revenue, which increased by $14 million, but is largely offset by higher conservation and DSM expense. A $11 million associated with the reversal of the fuel cost a indication regulatory reserves at SPS, $10 million from warmer than normal weather, $8 million from retail sales increases, excluding the impact of weather, and other factors which are detailed in our earnings release. Now in addition, I am pleased to note that our weather adjusted electric sales increased 1.5% year-to-date. This is fairly consistent with our expectations. Turning to our natural gas business, margins increased $2 million for the quarter, driven primarily by conservation revenue, which is largely offset by conservation and DSM expenses. Offsetting some of the improvement in margins, second quarter O&M expenses increased $44 million or 9.4%. Factors driving this second quarter increase in O&M expenses included $13 million of higher employee benefit costs related to performance-based incentive compensation and pension costs; $12 million of increased nuclear outage and plant operation costs; $7 million of higher labor costs; $6 million of higher plant generation costs, and other factors totaling an increase of $6 million. Through the first half of the year, O&M expenses increased 5.6%. We continue to project annual O&M costs to increase approximately 6% to 7% in 2010. Let's move on to our financing plans. Our financing plans for the balance of the year are unchanged. In May we issued $550 million of 10 year unsecured notes at 4.7% at the Xcel Energy holding company. At NSP-Minnesota we plan to issue $500 million of first mortgage bonds early in the third quarter. At PSCo we plan to issue approximately $400 million of first mortgage bonds in the fourth quarter. Finally we plan to issue $400 million of equity in 2010 or 2011. The timing of our equity offering will take several factors into account including market conditions; the timing of the Calpine asset acquisition; capital expenditures; cash generation and overall liquidity. We have flexibility on the timing. And we will be opportunistic regarding our stock price. The proceeds of the transaction will be used to fund our capital investment program, term out our short term debt; fund 2010 bond maturities, and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we'll use a portion of the proceeds from the holding company transactions to infuse equity into our utility subsidiaries. Our financing plan will enable us to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong credit metrics. As I am sure you can appreciate, our financing plans are subject to change depending on the timing of our capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions, and other factors. Given the number of investment opportunities, we have strong credit ratings are critical to support our strategy. We recently received positive news that Standard and Poor's upgraded the corporate credit rating on Xcel Energy and NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and SPS to A- from Triple B+ They also affirmed the A- corporate credit raining on NSP-Wisconsin. S&P stated that the rating upgrades reflected our successful execution of our strategy to invest in our regulated utilities and recover costs in our regulatory jurisdictions, most of which they consider to be credit supportive. In addition, Fitch recently reaffirmed Xcel Energy's credit ratings. Now let me give you a quick update on our pending and planned rate cases. In Colorado, we recently reached settlements with one of our wholesale customers. New rates reflecting an electric rate increase of approximately $17 million, for these customers, will be effective in July, subject to FERC approval of the settlement. In Minnesota we completed hearings in our gas rate case. Our request has been modified to a rate increase of about $10 million based on an ROE of 10.6%. The office of energy security is currently recommending a rate increase of approximately $7.5 million; we anticipate a commission decision this fall. In May we filed for $62 million electric rate increase in Texas. The request includes an 11.35 ROE and an equity ratio of 51%. On a net basis, the request seeks to increase customer bills by approximately $53.5 million or 7%. Intervener testimony for this case is scheduled to be filed in September. We anticipate final rates going into effect in early 2011. Looking ahead, we plan to file a limited re-opener in Wisconsin next month. In addition, we anticipate the need to file an electric rate case in Minnesota later this year. Finally we're pleased to put our discontinued corporate owned life insurance program call behind us for good. In July we reached a settlement with provident life and accident insurance company related to all our claims regarding our discontinued call program. Under the terms of the settlement we received $25 million earlier this month. The settlement of $25 million or approximately $0.05 of non-reoccurring earnings per share will be recorded during the third quarter. In summary, it's been a very good quarter. Comanche 3 came on line. We received route permits from two of our CapEx 20-20 projects. We reached a settlement in our call lawsuit. We continue to make good progress on various regulatory front and we received an important credit rating upgrade from S&P, which recognizes the successful execution of our business strategy. Year-to-date, our ongoing earnings are $0.07 ahead of last year. In addition, July weather has been warmer than normal. As a result, we're very comfortable reaffirming our ongoing earnings guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share. That concludes my prepared remarks. We're now ready for your questions.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of [Ashar Khan] with Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Just to check in. Could you just remind when you come up with your Colorado I guess environmental plan? When is that expected?
Ben Fowke:  We expect to file that August 13.
Unidentified Analyst:   August 13.
Ben Fowke:   Yes.
Unidentified Analyst:   And then just on your financing, if I could understand it, you said you could be opportunistic, with your stock at a 52-week hike, and then you said it depended upon the timing of the Calpine acquisition. I was just trying to get a better sense as to if you wanted could you do something in the immediate future, or you have to wait for some more nods on the Calpine acquisition?
Ben Fowke:   I'm, Ashar, really not going to elaborate beyond the prepared remarks in our script this morning on our equity issuance.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Daniele Seitz of Dudack Research Group. Please go ahead.
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group : I was just wondering - could you explain the Minnesota re-opener and also the regulatory decisions that will be made regarding CapEx 20-20 just from the point of view of how does it go into rate base, etcetera?
Ben Fowke:  What we have seen is the approval of our certificate of need, of our major lines here in the CapEx projects. Now we're currently recovering the cost of those projects through a rider mechanism and also as Ben spoke to we have received two of the very significant route permits that we were looking for with, you know, one segment of one of those lines, we have to yet clear up, and also, some of those certificates of need have been appealed and those appeals have been resolved. So we continue to advance on all fronts from a regulatory perspective and a cost recovery perspective.
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group : And also, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the PSCo pipeline and storage and what is the outlook and that at this substituting?
Ben Fowke:  It continues to operate this year, very much as planned with storage and transportation and we have been very please with what we have seen to date.
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group : With some expansion expected in the future? What are your plans there?
Ben Fowke:  I'm sorry Daniele…
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group : Do you see any expansion in the future?
Ben Fowke:  No, not at this point.
Operator:  Our next question comes are the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Given where you ended up through the first half and your comments that July obviously is trending harder as well, is it fair to assume that probably more comfortable on the higher end of the range that you have laid out for us for this year?
Ben Fowke:  Ali, I think you need to go back and look at that guidance, and understand that some of those lines of expenditures are not proportional to the quarter. And, you know, especially in northern utilities, O&M expenses are tilted a little bit more towards the third quarter, for example.  Also, you go back and take a look at where we are on interest and depreciation, and you see some back-end waiting. So, we have had lesser expense in the first half. You will see us catch up a little bit in the second half of the year. We remain very comfortable with the guidance range though. And, among your larger utilities going into this year it appeared that Colorado electric was the one that appeared to be under earning relative to a lot of ROEs. You wonder rate increase that you have full year of '09 and then the '10 increase, is it fair to say that Colorado electric should pretty much earnings its authorized return this year?
Dave Sparby:  We should get close to earning our authorized return.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And last question. Whether David you or Ben would like to comment you folks are obviously fairly active with EEI, activities, and any recent read on how you thinking things are shaping up out of Washington, whether in regards to the dividend, tax, or, you know, the EPA regulations, any thoughts from your perspective?
Ben Fowke : This is the Ben. We're cautiously optimistic on the dividend, and I mean, what will obviously come down to is an overall tax bill and, hopefully, we can get that. As we all know that is very important for the business. As far as EPA goes, it is one of the reasons why we have tried to as an industry group get some comprehensive Federal legislation regarding climate change because we don't think the EPA approach is the right approach.  And I think you have probably seen as we all have the death by thousand cuts or regulations that is out there with EPA is not great. I mean, as a company we're positioned pretty well for what came out just recently. But nevertheless, it is not the right way to go. But I think you're basically going to see gridlock on anything around that, for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, we won't see the same for the opportunity to reduce the dividend tax.
Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: From a CapEx perspective, then, can we expect any changes for '11 or even '12, what you're currently budgeting?
Ben Fowke:  I will let Dave give you the details but I think the short answer is no.
Dave Sparby:  Yes, the answer is no.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Go ahead. 
Leslie Rich - JPMorgan: You discussed in Wisconsin that you might file for a limited re-opener. And I wondered if you could just elaborate on the magnitude of that and what items you're looking to address?
Ben Fowke:  I will let Scott Wilensky in charge of our regulatory area and is managing that filing speak to that. 
Scott Wilensky: That is going to address the capital costs for production and transmission that we have planned to incur in 2011, as well as an update of our fuel expenses. We're going in the neighborhood of, relatively modest increase in the 3% to 6% range. We're still obviously finalizing things.
Leslie Rich - JPMorgan:  Okay and you said you would be doing that in the third quarter?
Scott Wilensky:  Early in August, yes. 
Leslie Rich - JPMorgan: And that would be decided how quickly? 
Scott Wilensky:  We're hopeful that we will get a decision by the end of the year.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: I was wondering if you could give us any insights on what you're seeing economically in your service territories, you know, are you seeing some pickup in activity or place the read in Colorado and Minnesota and in the Southwest?
Ben Fowke:  We have seen some pickup, but it has not been across the board. When we talked to you last quarter, what we were seeing was, some sectors who have continued to be strong, like energy, and other sectors, continuing to be weak, like services, agriculture, and food.  But we have seen more of, in the second quarter is a pick up in some segments of manufacturing. Things like mining, some steel, some industries that make parts for automobiles. All pick up a little bit. But the increase in production and manufacturing has not been broad-based and that's why we have a bit more cautious outlook than maybe others do. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: And then I was curious, on your break down of the electric margin. You have one item is the retail sales increase, and then the other is sales mix and demand revenues. What's the distinction between those two items?
Ben Fowke:  Well, what we see from time to time is a change in demand. (inaudible)And, that's often reflect of customers moving between classes, the particular tariffs into effect and how they are affected by ratchets and other items.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay. Then the last thing I was curious, part of increase in the O&M was related to line outages and nuclear outages just kind of what's the schedule going forward. How do you expect that to compare, say, in the second half?
Ben Fowke:  With respect to the outage schedule, it will say strong. As I talked about earlier, this is a point in the year when a fair amount of that is done. I think it's important to keep in mind when you look year-over-year this is a lot more normal summer for us. There was some things that we didn't have to do last year because it was much cooler. This year, the maintenance schedule, particularly that maintenance that's key to the run hours and the starts of a lot of units, is going to look much more like our historic spend pattern.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: As far as the nuke unites, what's that? Are there any outages planned in the second half and…
Ben Fowke:  There is just one outage this year, Dan. 
Dave Sparby: And Dan, just a point to remember is that we have a deferral and amortization that's it for nuclear outages. As a result of that what you see is a fairly levelized cost. Now, obviously if nuclear outages increase in cost that cost would be reflected. And there is a little bit of a pick-up in 2010 because we're starting to this is probably the last year of the step increase of making the accounting change. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Rudy Tolentino with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley : Just a kind of as a follow-up to Dan's question. Was there a part of the country in your service territory that had higher load increases than others? Was Minnesota stronger than Texas or Colorado? If you could give a little color on that? 
Ben Fowke:  Sure, Rudy. What we saw in first quarter was as we moved from south to north, and from west to east, we went from seeing recovery being above average to recovery being much closer to average. So, we saw recovery, and in fact the downturn being very slight in Texas. We've seen Colorado with an above average recovery. And what we've seen in Minnesota and Wisconsin parallels very much the national recovery. 
Rudy Tolentino - Morgan Stanley : Okay and then, speaking of Texas I know you send the Texas rate case 11.35 ROE and 51% equity ratios, which send a release as far as what you asked for. What is it currently? 
Ben Fowke:  Yeah. Scott, do you want to address that? 
Scott Wilensky:  Our last two rate cases in Texas have been achieved through black box settlements where those items have not been identified specifically. There really isn't an authorized ROE at this point. 
Operator:  Our next question comes as a follow-up from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dudack Research Group. Please go ahead. 
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group: In your August filing in Colorado will that also include assuming your plan is adopted, riders associated to different projects and will that also include the two gas plants that you just purchased or are the gas plants separate from in terms of rate consideration. 
Ben Fowke:  Daniele, the answer to that question is yes. The plan will include a regulatory recovery component. 
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group: Okay and the gas plants will be part of it or are the new gas plants that you just purchased? Or are they going to be considered separately from the plan? 
Ben Fowke:  If you're referring to the Calpine plants that is proceeding under a different docket, and that's one that is to be resolved in October. 
Daniele Seitz - Dudack Research Group: Okay. And that will include the rate consideration as well? 
Ben Fowke:  Yes. 
Operator:  our next question comes from the line of Timothy Yee with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Yee - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Do you have any sense of when you might get that third route permit on CapEx 2020 for that third line? I think it's (inaudible)? 
Ben Fowke:  Scott, do you have an answer? 
Scott Wilensky:  We're expecting that in the third quarter. 
Timothy Yee - KeyBanc Capital Markets: I guess what happens after the route permit as to when the construction begins for each of these lines and the timing of the investments for those lines? 
Dave Sparby:  We begin all of the classic instruction process require land for lay down yards, acquire any land that remains to be acquired and begin construction. 
Ben Fowke:  I think the ramp up, though, probably occurs a couple of years from now really when it relates to CapEx 2020 and continues…
Dave Sparby:  Sure the span. 
Ben Fowke:  So if that's your question. 
Dave Sparby:  So kind of we are looking for a couple of years from now when the ramp up begins.
Ben Fowke:  Transaction transmission will be a very big part of our capital profile as you get to the middle and latter part of the decade it's a result of all the years of efforts we've already put into project like CapEx 2020. It takes a very long time to get these things done. 
Operator:  And at this time there are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. 
Dave Sparby: I want to thank everyone for attending our second quarter conference call. We look forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next several weeks. And if there are any follow up questions, Paul Johnson and the IR team are available to take your calls. Thank you. 
Operator:  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Xcel Energy's second quarter 2010 earnings conference call.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-04-29 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Paul Johnson – Managing Director of Investor Relations & Assistant Treasurer Ben Fowke – President and COO Dave Sparby – VP and CFO
Analysts: Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities Timothy Yee – KeyBanc Mark Barnett – Morningstar Sarah Acres - Wells Fargo 
Operator: Welcome to the first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded today, Thursday April 29, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer Mr. Paul Johnson, please go ahead sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s first quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operator Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today we plan to cover our first quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of a $1.55 to a $1.65 per share. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. I want to remind everyone that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. You’ll note that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. The difference between first quarter 2010 ongoing and GAAP earnings is related to nonrecurring items, which I will explain in a moment. First quarter ongoing earnings were $0.42 per share in 2010 compared with $0.38 per share in 2009. GAAP earnings were $0.36 per share in 2010 compared with $0.38 per share in 2009. The $0.06 variance is due to the following items. In March of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law. One of the provisions of the act reduces deductibility of retiree healthcare costs. Based on this provision, Xcel Energy is subject to additional tax and is required to reverse previously recorded tax benefits. As a result, we expensed $17 million or $0.04 per share of previously recognized tax benefit related to Medicare Part D subsidies in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, after reaching an agreement in principle with the IRS during the first quarter, Xcel Energy recorded an adjustment of $0.02 per share for interest and taxes associated with the completion of a comprehensive tax reconciliation related to Xcel Energy's discontinued company-owned life insurance program. We do not consider either of these two items as part of ongoing earnings as they are not expected to reoccur in the future. Management believes ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of non-reoccurring items provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, we will discuss ongoing earnings during the remainder of this call. Please see are our first quarter earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to ongoing earnings.  With that I'll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Paul and welcome everyone. As Paul mentioned, this morning we reported first quarter ongoing earnings of $0.42 per share compared with $0.38 per share in 2009. This is a positive start to the year. Dave Sparby will discuss quarterly results in more detail. I'll focus my comments on some recent developments in Colorado. We recently announced an agreement to acquire two natural gas plants from Calpine for $739 million. These generation facilities currently provide power to our customers in Colorado through purchase power agreements. Acquiring these assets will provide long-term cost savings to our customers. We believe that owning these plants is important as we strive to meet Colorado's new 30% renewable portfolio standard by 2020. In addition, we expect the transaction will be accretive in 2011 and will drive earnings growth for shareholders. The acquisition is subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. In May we will make a filing with Colorado Commission seeking approval of the acquisition and interim rate recovery of the revenue requirements associated with the plants. We anticipate that this acquisition will have a small impact on customer bills as the rate increase will be offset by savings in capacity payments on other current PPA. The transaction is expected to close in December 2010. In April, the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act was signed into law by Governor Ritter of Colorado. The bill establishes a timeline and regulatory framework for PSCo to develop a plant to potentially retrofit, retire or replace 900 MW or more of older and less efficient coal fire generation. PSCo may retrofit its existing coal fired plants with emission controls, will retire and replace the plants with natural gas fire generation or other low-emitting resources. We will file our plan with the Colorado PUC by mid August and the commission will roll in the plan by year end. The law allows for right of recovery of the investments associated with this bill. The bill also allows for interim rates and helps with achieving forward test years in general rate cases. This is another great example of our ability to work with key stakeholders to arrive at a creative solution to reduce the emissions while ensuring timely recovery of cost. Finally, we continue to make progress putting Comanche 3 into commercial operation. During our recent testing phase the plants delivered output of approximately 800 megawatts which is above the expected output of 750 megawatts Comanche 3 is currently offline to prepare the unit for final full load performance tuning and testing.  A number of punch less repairs associated with the plant were completed and we will installed baffles to address some noise issue that was caused by the new induced-draft fans. We now plan to bring the plant into service in early May. We kind of few startup just to work through, we are very confident this plant will deliver strong value to our customers. With that I’ll turn the call over to Dave, who’ll walk you through our first quarter results, discuss our financing plans and provide a regulatory update. 
David Sparby:  Thanks Ben. Now let's take a look at the details of our first quarter results starting with a review of each of our subsidiary. During the quarter earnings at PSCo increased $0.06 per share largely due to the rate increases that went into effect in July 2009 and January 2010. At NSP-Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.02 per share due to warm winter weather and higher O&M costs. At NSP-Wisconsin, earnings declined by $0.01 per share due to fuel recovery, sluggish sales and higher O&M cost. Higher electric rates effective January 2010 offset some of these negative factors.  At SPS, earnings were flat for the quarter as higher operating costs offset new rates that went into effect in February and July of 2009. Next I’ll discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased by $46 million for the first quarter of 2010. The increase was largely driven by rate increases in Colorado, Texas, Wisconsin and New Mexico which improved electric margin by $57 million.  Conservation revenue increased by $13 million; however this revenue is largely offset by higher conservation and DSM expense. Retail sales increases excluding the impact of weather increased electric margin by $6 million. These positive factors were partially offset by a variety of smaller items which are detailed in our earnings release. We also had strong gas margins which increased $12 million in the first quarter. The increase was largely due to an interim rate increase in Minnesota, the impact of weather and higher weather normalized sales.  Turning to expenses, first quarter O&M expenses increased about $9 million or about 2%. While we did a nice job of keeping cost increases to a minimal level for the quarter, some of this reflects expense timing as we expect that annual O&M cost will increase approximately 6 to 7% for the year. Next I’ll provide you with an update on our financing plans. We have updated our plants as a result of our agreement to acquire two natural gas generation plants from Calpine. The acquisition was not included in our previous capital expenditure forecast.  In addition to periodic issuance and repayment of short term debt, we plan to issue the following securities at the holding company. Plan to issue approximately $500 million of long term debt during the second quarter of 2010. In addition we planned to issue approximately $400 million of equity in 2010 or 2011.  At NSP-Minnesota, our financing plans have not changed. We planned to issue approximately $500 million of first mortgage bond in the third quarter of 2010. We also now planned to issue approximately $400 million of first quarter bonds – first mortgage bonds at PSCo in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Generally speaking the proceeds from these transactions will be used to fund their capital investment program, term out our short term debt from 2010 bond maturities and for general corporate purposes. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the holding company transactions will be used to infuse equity into our utility subsidiaries. Our financing plan will enable us to maintain a solid balance sheet and strong credit metrics. As you’re probably aware our financing plans are subject to change depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors.  Lastly, we have a fairly light regulatory schedule, but let me give you a quick update on our pending and planned rate cases. In November we filed a request with the Commission to increase Minnesota gas rates by $16 million for 2010. The request is based on an ROE of 11% and equity ratio of 52.5% and a rate base of $441 million. The interim rates of $11.1 million went into effect in January and we expect the decision late this year.  In 2009, PSCo filed to increased to Colorado wholesale rates by $30 million based on a 12.5% ROE, a 58% equity ratio and a rate base of $315 million. We are in settlement discussions with our wholesale customers and expect rates to go into effect later in 2010. Finally, in the coming months we’ve planned to file a Texas retail case in May and a Wisconsin re-opener later this summer. We expect final rates from both cases to go into effect in 2010.  This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we can now take questions. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  Thank you, good morning. 
Benjamin Fowke :  Good morning Ali.  
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : David or Ben, when you talked about the Calpine asset acquisition, you said it would be accretive in 2011. So if you give us some sense of the magnitude of that accretion? 
Benjamin Fowke :  Sure and it of course depends on the regulatory timing of approvals and other factors Ali, but I think if you used a $0.02 to $0.03 benchmark that would be pretty close. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey :  Okay. And the second question, David you talked about the expenses and how they were lining up for the year. Could you also give a sense on load growth and the assumptions that you baked in for your full year guidance. So far our expenses and the load growth that you’re seeing pretty much following the assumptions that you guys have made for the year?
David Sparby: Yes, we forecast about 1% low growth, we’re still on track and this is on the electric side to see that, so far expenses are in track so first quarter is following plan. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And my last question, also you alluded to the light regulatory calendar currently and a couple of filings later this year, but as you look into 11 and beyond, you’ve come from a very pact regulatory agenda last several years. Where should we expect a pick up on the regulatory agenda front looking out in the next couple of years? 
David Sparby: Well we continued to evaluate 11 very closely, we have both on increasing rate base as well as increasing pension costs, so we’re continuing to look closely at our larger jurisdictions especially here in Minnesota, Ali. 
Ali Agha – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thank you. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from the line of Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. 
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities:  Good afternoon. Quick question, what’s your sensitivity to every 1% change in demand growth for this year or next? 
Benjamin Fowke :  It of course depends a little bit on the company Nathan and a little bit on the class that’s affected, but if you look to impact both demand and energy change together it’d be about $30 million.  
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities : And now with net income and not EBIT is that right?
Benjamin. Fowke:  Yes.
David Sparby:   But Nathan, that’s pretax. 
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities : Margin, the $30 million and that’s assuming that there is a pretty comparable change across. 
David Sparby:
 : Right. Because of that companies Nathan have different margins and of course the classes have different margins and then there is seasonal rate differences also. 
Benjamin Fowke :  And Nathan, you remember this is Ben, you remember last year we were addressing this question and we kind of used that $30 million rule of thumb but it really, the impact wasn’t as severe because we were seeing declines and places that have more demand based revenue than gettable recovery. So to Dave’s point, it really depends but that’s just a real rough rule of thumb. 
David Sparby:   Yes and just to add to that, if we weren’t seeing a change in demand just looking at the change in energy, it’d be closer to $20 million but again that’s a very general rule of thumb.   
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities : Great and just confirm, you mentioned that your expectations were being met with demand growth and I just know you’re expecting to grow at 1% to your demand growth in the first quarter was well above that on a normalized basis. Can you give us further details on how you see demand play out this year, as it does seem to be some fairly robust recovery demand across the nation and in your service area. 
Benjamin Fowke :  Well we’re of course measuring from a very low point last year Nathan that we had seen significant drop off in sales first quarter of last year, so quarter-to-quarter it looks a little greater, but you shouldn’t think as that is necessarily representative of what you’ll see in the later quarters and although this past quarter we have seen some nice pickup in Colorado in SPS, frankly we haven’t seen it at NSP-Minnesota or NSP-Wisconsin. So we’re cautiously optimistic but we’re not at the point of saying we’re going to beat that 1%. 
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities :  Great, thank you. And just I know you’ve got still positive but just, could you just give us an idea where you are with your coal inventories and anything you see in that market? Thank you. 
Benjamin Fowke:  We’re at about 44 days, we’re just a little bit ahead of target, about the target better said. 
Nathan Judge – Atlantic Equities : Thank you. 
Operator: 
 :
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc : Good morning. Could you just give us a little more detail as to I guess what to expect as far as the Colorado approval for the acquisition and the timing of the interim rates, like when that might go into effect? 
Benjamin Fowke :   Sure, we’d expect the commission to give us a decision before year end and I think realistically you’d expect some type of rider recovery to begin in January 2011. 
 :
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc :  And then I guess just looking at your financing with the mention of the equity, and I’m just trying to reconcile that with no change in your guidance assumptions for shares outstanding this year. Would it be fair to say you might still be opportunistic with the timing of any equity issuances in 2010, or is that just? 
Benjamin Fowke :  No, that’s a fair interpretation, I mean we obviously there is a timeframe that we provided 10 or 11 with respect to when we’ll issue that so you shouldn’t read into our guidance that we’ve made a decision other than that.  
Timothy Yee – KeyBanc :  Okay. Thank you very much.
Benjamin Fowke :  Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Mark Barnett – Morningstar:  Good morning guys. 
Benjamin Fowke :  Good morning Mike. 
Mark Barnett – Morningstar:
Benjamin Fowke :  Well, Mark I’ll say that we are seeing that trend that the large industrial customers are recovering and they are recovering first, but just like as demand declined they were the first to decline and we saw the smaller C&I customers decline later. On the recovery we’re seeing the large C&I especially those affected by the stimulus bill for example those that manufacture parts for the automobile industry recover first but our C&I sales altogether are still being anchored by small C&I which haven’t seen the benefits or recovery get to them yet.   
Mark Barnett – Morningstar:
Benjamin Fowke :  Yes, clearly Colorado and SPS have seen more of a net recovery in that regard large C&I offset the slow recovery of C&I. Here we haven’t seen that yet, we’ve seen large C&I recovered but slow C&I continues to lag them. 
Mark Barnett – Morningstar:  Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Acres [ph] with Wells Fargo.
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo:  Hey good morning. 
Benjamin Fowke:  Good morning Sarah. 
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo: You mentioned in the K, a proposal in Minnesota to eliminate the interim rates. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that and anything else we should keep our eye on the legislative front. 
Benjamin Fowke :  Yes, that proposal never made it out of committee. So it’s no longer being considered in the legislature. There is a bill reflecting some reporting requirements that are already pretty much incorporated into the sates regulatory framework. So there really isn’t anything of any significance pending at this point.  
Sarah Acres – Wells Fargo: Thank you.  
Operator:  And management, I show no further no further questions in queue at this time. 
Benjamin Fowke :  Alright, well thank you everyone for participating in our first quarter call. If there is any additional questions, please call Paul Johnson and our IR team.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer; please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy 2009 year end earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me today are Ben Fowke, President and Chief Operator Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President, Regulatory and Resource Planning; George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer; Michael Connelly, Vice President and General Counsel. Today we planned to cover our 2009 results and accomplishments. Please note that there are slides accompany the conference call, which are available on our webpage. Let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipate are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. You’ll notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. 2009 ongoing earnings were $1.50 per share, compared with $1.45 per share in 2008. 2009 GAAP earnings were $1.48 per share, compared with the $1.46 per share in 2009. As you may recall in 2007, we reached a settlement resolving a dispute with the IRS regarding our Company Owned Life Insurance program, also known as COLI. Our 2009 GAAP earnings included a charge of $0.01 per share, for a legal cost associated with our claims against insurance providers and brokers of the COLI policies. In addition, we incurred a discontinued operations charge of $0.01 per share related to tax expense and legal accruals for previously divested businesses. Our 2008 GAAP earnings include a $0.01 per share benefit from discontinued COLI programs. Management believes that ongoing earnings, which removes the impact of COLI and discontinued operations provides a more meaningful comparison. As a result, we will discuss ongoing earnings during this call. Please see note six in today’s earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and ongoing earnings results. I’ll now turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Thanks Paul and good morning. I’m pleased to announce that Xcel Energy had another successful year. This morning, we’ve reported 2009 ongoing earnings of $1.50 per share compared with $1.45 per share in 2008. Proud to deliver our earnings results at the midpoint of our 2009 earnings guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, despite unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share and decline in electricity sales due to sluggish economy, which reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. To offset the impact of unfavorable weather and lower sales, we took actions to reduce expenses and reached constructive outcomes in seven State rate cases in order to deliver earnings within our guidance range. Resolution of these cases as well as two rate cases also provides greater regulatory certainty as we began 2010. We have a relatively light docket this year with two smaller rate cases pending, a Minnesota gas rate case on a per coal sale rate case in Colorado. In addition, we plan to file our wholesale case in a retail reopened case in Wisconsin. Operationally, customer satisfaction and reliability improved in 2009. We completed major construction projects like MERP and Fort St. Vrain. We also made significant progress on the construction of Comanche 3. Final testing is being completed and we expect this plant to go in service in February. Comanche 3 will deliver tremendous value to our customers with the construction cost of approximately $1500 per KW. I’ll now turn the call over to Dave Sparby, who’ll walk you through the year end results and also give you a regulatory update.
Dave Sparby: Thanks Ben and good morning. Let’s take a look at the details of 2009 starting with a review of the annual results at each of our subsidiaries. For the year, earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.04 per share. The decrease was largely due to the negative impact of weather and raising cost, which was partially offset by new electric rates that went into effect last July. In NSP-Minnesota, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share. The decline result of largely from cooler than normal summer temperatures and timing of nuclear outage expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an electric rate increase that went into effect in January 2009. NSP-Wisconsin, earnings were flat for the year. Increased costs were offset by better fuel recovery and new rates that went into effect in January 2009. At SPS, earnings increased by $0.08 per share, the improved financial results were due to 2009 electric rate increase, in Texas and New Mexico and the resolution of fuel cost issues. Finally, our investment in WYCO, our natural gas pipeline in Colorado generated $0.02 per share of incremental earnings. Next I’ll discuss the drivers that affected various lines of the income statement, beginning with retail electric margin. Electric margin increased by $297 million during 2009. This was largely driven by rate increases in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, which increased electric margin by $218 million. Conservation revenue, non-fuel riders, and MERP riders also to increase retail electric margin by a total of $113 million, increases in the conservation revenue, however, are largely offset by higher conservation in DSM expense. Some of the factors that offset these increases include purchased capacity costs, primarily at SPS, which reduced margin by $44 million, cool summer temperatures, which reduced margin by $6 million, and a decline in weather adjusted retail sales, which reduced margin by $22 million. Turning to expenses, 2009 O&M increased about $130 million or 7%, some of the contributing factors to the O&M increase included higher employee benefit cost, which increased $90 million, the increase was due to performance based incentive expense, active health care costs, and pension expense in 2009. As you recall, we didn’t accrue any incentive compensation in 2008. An increase in nuclear outage costs of $30 million, the increase was the result of the Minnesota commission’s approval of the change in a recovery of nuclear refueling outages in 2008 and finally, higher nuclear plant operations expenses, which increased $21 million primarily due to higher security costs and regulatory fees. Fees and other items were partially offset by lower consulting costs and lower bad debt expense. For the year depreciation expense decreased by $10 million, the decrease was largely the result of regulatory decisions, which extends the lives of our nuclear plants for the purposes of determining depreciation and decommissioning expense. Next, I’ll touch on some of the regulatory developments, starting with the cases that wrapped up at the end of the year. We recently completed our 2010 Colorado electric case. In that case, the commission improved an electric rate increase of $128 million based on authorized ROE of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 58%. Subsequent to the commission’s approval of the rate increase, it became apparent that Comanche 3 would not be in service at the end of 2009. We filed a proposal with the commission to phase in the rate increase to reflect the actual in service date of Comanche 3. The CPUC approved our proposal and as a result, the rate increase will be phased in over three steps. A rate increase of $67 million was implemented on January 1. Electric rates will increase another $54 million, when Comanche 3 goes into service currently expected to occur in February and finally, rates will increase another $7 million in January 2011 to recover property taxes associated with Comanche 3. The phase and due rate reduces the impact on our customers and we’ll have minimal earnings impact on PSCo or Xcel Energy. Last June, we filed a request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by $30 million based on an REO of 10.75% and a 2010 forecast test year. In December the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approved an electric rate increase of approximately $6.4 million and no change in gas rates, based on 10.4% ROE and 52.3% equity ratio. The major differences between the amount requested and the authorized includes a variety of items that do not affect our earnings such as, savings from the life extension of the Prairie Island nuclear plant for purposes of determining depreciation and decommissioning and a significant drop in forecast fuel cost. The major earnings related adjustments were lower ROE and equity ratio. Last June we also filed a request to increase South Dakota Electric Rates by about $19 million based on an ROE of 11.25% and a 2008 historic test year with adjustments for known and measurable changes. Earlier this month, the South Dakota Commission approved a rate increase of $10.9 million. The difference between the requested increase and the settlement amount related to a lower ROE use of a 20 year life for Prairie Island nuclear plant, which reduces the revenue deficiency and expense accruals by a corresponding amount. New rates went into effect earlier this month. After completing an ambitious regulatory effort in 2009, we enter 2010 with an improved regulatory certainty and only two pending rate cases. In November, we filed a request with the commission to increase Minnesota gas rates by $16 million in 2010. The request is based on an ROE of 11% and equity ratio of 52.5% and a rate base of $441 million. Interim rates of $11.1 million went into effect in January. We expect a decision late this year. In 2009, PSCO filed an increase Colorado wholesale rates by $30 million, based on a 12.5% ROE, a 58% equity ratio, and a rate base of $315 million. We are in settlement discussions with our wholesale customers and expect rates to go into effect later in 2010. Before we go to Q-and-A, Ben has a few closing remarks.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Dave. In closing, in a year largely defined by sluggish electric retail sales and unfavorable weather. I’m proud that we were again able to deliver on our financial objectives. On the regulatory front, we received constructive outcomes in our rate cases. These outcomes enable Xcel Energy to continue to make prudent investments across our service territories. Our successes in 2009, demonstrate our commitment to achieving our financial objectives, while delivering quality service to our customers. Finally, we are reaffirming our ongoing earnings guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share for 2010. I’ll now turn it back over to Dave and we’ll open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ali Agha - SunTrust.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Given all the rate cases that you all have completed in ‘09 and as you mentioned fairly light regulatory activity in 2010, if you look at your utility portfolio today and you compare, the ROE’s that you are earning currently versus aloud, would you say that the regulatory lag is pretty much eliminated now? Or how would you categorize that actual ROEs versus authorized ROEs at this point.
Dave Sparby: We continue to make improvement every year as you know. Ali, we’ve added significant amounts to our ability to recover through riders as well as we’ve improved the timing of rate cases. So we’ve seen some lag, we managed to reduce it and we see ourselves continuing to reduce that lag further over the next couple of years.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: So you would not say that you’re pretty much earning authorized returns across the portfolio yet? That is still more to be done?
Dave Sparby: We’ll earn close to 10% across the portfolio. We do have some of our op those more opportunities to earn closer to that average. We see ourselves continuing to make progress in that regard.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: Just to be clear, the 10% you expect would be for the 2010?
Dave Sparby: Yes.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: What was the number for ‘09?
Dave Sparby: It was in the 9.6 to 9.7 range.
Ali Agha - SunTrust: One other question, as you look at your CapEx program going forward and you look at your external capital needs, when do you believe or think that you would need to raise more equity as part of this plan?
Dave Sparby: We don’t have any plans to raise equity in 2010. We’ll continue to evaluate the need for equity based on expenditures and market conditions following that period.
Operator: Your next question comes from Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research: I was wondering it seems that the O&M increase continues to be at the 6% and 7% range and could you explain when an increase is still coming from benefit increases, or if it includes also the effect of Comanche 3.
Dave Sparby: It reflects two primary components. The first was the effect of the Commission’s decision in 2008 to move to a different means of recording our outage expenses, Danielle. That had an impact on increasing costs in 2009 versus 2008. Also is reflected the difference between not paying out any incentive compensation in 2008 as compared to 2009. Those differences account for a big part of that change in our O&M expense. It’s also important to consider that we continue to add rate base over that period of time. We’ve added a lot of projects like our pre-go projects, which is our Buffalo Ridge transmission project. So we continue to add rate base and operating plan.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research: In terms of 2010 outlook, it seems that you’re anticipating roughly the same amount. Is this more due to the new unit again coming in, or is it again mostly due to benefits?
Dave Sparby: It is in part due to the addition of Comanche 3. We see higher chemical costs as well as the last tranche of expense related to our nuclear outage cost as a result of the deferral and amortization method approved by the Minnesota Commission.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank.
Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank: I was going to ask on sales trends it seems that as you look at the fourth quarter in isolation on a normalized basis both in residential and C&I things ticked down a little from the third quarter. Can you talk about what maybe going on in those numbers in the context of your outlook for 2010, and just some commentary of trends across the regions and on the sales front?
Dave Sparby: Sure. Well, we do retain some slight optimism of course for 2010. Overall, we’re seeing about a 1% increase in sales. The optimism is really generated from our look at some regional and local indicators, including things like housing starts, employment prospects, as well as that purchaser managers’ index. Now, we’re seeing more of that come back in the C&I class in 2010 and then of course part of that is because sales retreated a little further on the C&I than on the residential class, but of course, overall, the states we serve have remained pretty strong in ‘09 when you look at employment prospects and others and we think that they’ll be some of the first to recover here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: Two questions, one about your Comanche 3 plans. How should we think about it? You said that the plans should be online in February. Any estimate as to will it be the beginning of the month or simply don’t know. Should we think that the other increase in revenues will be prorated depending on when the plan actually goes online?
Ben Fowke: Angie, this is Ben. The plan has had a few startup issues, primarily with some of the wells, but we think we have that fixed and we anticipate probably in service in the middle of February. Of course we’ll update that, it could be earlier or it could be later, but that’s the best estimate we have right now. As far as the revenue, as soon as it goes in service, we pickup the piece of the revenue that was associated with Comanche 3, which we aren’t receiving right now. With the settlement, as you know it was designed to be earnings neutral for us while we were seeing some delays with Comanche 3. Again as I said on the call, a $1500 KW price, I mean that’s a sensational price point for our customers. It’s going to be a great value for our customers and it’s a very efficient modern plant, which allows us to take a look at some of our less efficient plants.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: Also any updates regarding your environmental CapEx, especially the wind farms, any ownership plans for the future, any update on this front?
Dave Sparby: Angie, they all continue to go well. We’ve received the necessary approvals from the Minnesota and Wisconsin commissions and all other prospects are positive for those facilities, including the work with the transmission.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: Given the fact that there seems to be a couple of distressed wind assets in the region, your still prefer a new build to acquiring existing assets?
Ben Fowke: I’m not aware of any distressed wind asset sales in the region and our plans are to continue with the construction of these assets. Their economic in perspective of our resource acquisition plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom O’Neil - [Green Arrow].
Tom O’Neil - Green Arrow: I just had a question regarding 2010 guidance relative to 2009. I guess 2009 on a weather adjusted basis is $1.55. So I guess just without any rate cases hanging in the balance in 2010. I’m just curious the thinking on the range and is it mainly the economy that keeps you a little more conservative?
Dave Sparby: Certainly the economy is something that we follow very closely. Now, Tom, you also can’t simply take the weather that we didn’t see in 2009 and add it to 2010. That brought with it some natural hedge for us. Units that have maintenance based on number of starts and running hours, for example as well as the lack of escalated operations in our distribution system are events that we wouldn’t expect to see repeated in the event that we had more weather.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: I want to touch basically on two things. First of all, the Minnesota Attorney General, I think along with the State Senator has introduced legislation with respect to I guess the riders or what have you through the interim increases and what have you? Do you feel that legislation has lags or can you give perspective as to that? As I recall, we also saw something in Colorado a year or two ago, where they apparently had some sort of issue associated with automatic or not automatic, but more abbreviated rate increases?
Ben Fowke: In Minnesota, what we have is a regulatory framework that matches up very well the States policy objectives and that’s allowed us to do what we’ve been able to do in terms of managing carbon and increasing DSM and the like. So I don’t expect that legislation to pass because it’s been a very significant part of what we’ve been able to do here. There certainly will be some discussion about it. It is not a policy session at the legislature and consequently, I don’t expect that to be enacted or looked at in great deal detail this coming session.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: The situation in Colorado what is that over with now? I don’t remember what happened actually there?
Scott Wilensky: This is Scott Wilensky. The commission did express some concern about the number of riders we had and it as us to address those in a series of rate cases. We actually did that and I think there’s a comfort that is grown that these riders are actually facilitating some of the public policy goals in the state and are a necessary mechanism to keep the investment going. I think that it moving through the series of rate cases, we’ve dealt with those issues.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Finally on Comanche 3, you that basically just start up issues, you don’t have any expectation that those will be operational issues? Is that correct?
Scott Wilensky: You mean things we’ll be living with for some time?
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: I mean in other words to the steam to problem I think it was I am really it exactly what it is but there’s a mechanical issue there I am just wondering that.
Ben Fowke: We’re if I canning it and we’re fixing it right and the vendor that was responsible and these were factory welds is step up in this is taking them so this going to be some kind of performance or operational issue that plague us post startup very much on top of that actually.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities 
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities: Just a question on transmission. We’ve seen it in other regions throughout getting pushback turn on the economy I want to do comment on your portfolio projects are you seeing is there any change in the thought process in terms of timing or it same pretty much moving along 18 months ago.
Ben Fowke: Neil, as we look across our service territory, all of the transmission projects continue to move forward very well. When we look at CapEx, which is our regional approach in the north, and you look at each one of those lines, we see we’re well into the routing of those lines.  The acceptance has been good and continues to make good progress when we look at the nine lines that are a part of the SD 100 project in Colorado. It’s really only one line where we’re facing some resistance. All lines continue to move forward through the process when you look down to SPS, whether it’s the seven rivers to PSCo project or any of the others we also ten to good progress so that’s moving along as we expected.
Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities: Would there be any concern if sort of loads didn’t do what you thought this year might that threaten so many projects in terms of timeframes?
Ben Fowke: You kind of faded out if I understood the question would we expect to change our plans if loads continue to be low this year? These are very long term projects, looking at bringing very competitive renewable energy as well as addressing some reliability issues in the region. So, I wouldn’t expect our plans to change.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  I was curious first on the South Dakota rate case decision; it mentions on the slide that it was a black box settlement. Does that mean there’s no authorized ROE that we can kind of use as a guide there or how should we think about the ROE for that rate case?
Dave Sparby: None stated, Dan.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: As far as your Minnesota case, what was the, you filed for 11% ROE what was the last allowed ROE for the Minnesota gas?
Dave Sparby: That was 9.71% when our last 2007 natural gas case.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Then I was curious if you could give a little more color on in your earnings guidance, you mentioned 1% electric retail sales growth. Are you expecting any differences between various geographies or are you seeing more or less growth than the various customer classes?
Ben Fowke: We are seeing some differentiation, Dan. There’ll be more growth for example in Colorado CNI than the remaining CNI classes. Although it’s not a material amount relative to what we’re seeing and other PSCo probably last growth than the other PSCo in the class in Wisconsin.  So there are some differences they’re not real significant and, when we talk about growth, it’s important to consider that in the context of our DSM objectives in 2010 because they’re also very aggressive in Minnesota, for example our demand side management objective will be to save about 1.1% energy for our customers. So as you look at these growth rates, we would suggest you put that in that context.
Operator: Your final question comes from Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research :  I was wondering if you had a number for the amount of you got through the riders in ‘09 and how much did you assume for 2010?
Paul Johnson:  Danielle, this is Paul Johnson. Why don’t you give me a call afterwards and I’ll get you those numbers. The increase for 2010 is expected to be about $30 million, but the absolute amount; we don’t have at our fingertips here.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back to Dave Sparby for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Dave Sparby: Well, thank you all for attending our year end and quarter close. If there are any follow up questions, please refer them to Paul Johnson and our IR Team.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all the participants are in a listen-only mode. And following the formal presentation instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, October 29, 2009. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Paul Johnson, who is the Managing Director for Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Sir, you may now begin.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy's third quarter 2009 earnings release conference call. I'm Paul Johnson. With me today is Ben Fowke, President, Chief Operating Officer; Dave Sparby, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller; Scott Wilensky, Vice President of Regulatory and Resource Planning and George Tyson, Vice President and Treasurer. Today, we plan to cover our third quarter results and provide a business update. In addition, we'll provide additional information on our 2009 guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call which are available on our webpage. Let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. You'll also notice that today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Since it wasn't a material difference between GAAP and ongoing earnings, we'll refer to GAAP earnings during this morning's discussion. I will now turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Thanks Paul and welcome everyone. This morning we reported third quarter 2009 earnings of 221 million or $0.48 per share compared with 223 million or $0.51 per share in 2008. In a few moments Dave Sparby will walk you through the results. I'd like to focus my comments on how we're performing relative to our expectations from the beginning of the year. Let me begin with sales, going into 2009, we forecasted weather normalized electric sales would be roughly flat with 2008. As you are well aware electric sales nationwide had been adversely impacted by the economic down turn. And while the impact on our service territory has been less dramatic, year to-date weather adjusted electric sales are down 1.7%. As a result, we estimate that the decline in electric good sales reduced our year-to-date earnings by a little more than $0.02 per share. However, the decline in electric sales has largely been confined to the C&I class and the impact has been partially mitigated by demand revenue. On a consolidated basis, our year-to-date residential weather adjusted sales have actually increased by 0.5%. While the economy has generally been an issue for all companies across the United States, weather and tax issues have been the most significant drivers in the third quarter and year-to-date results for us. Year-to-date weather has reduced earnings by $0.06 per share with a majority of the impact in the third quarter. In addition, we've experienced a higher than expected effective tax rate which reduced earnings by a little over $0.02 per share year-to-date. Offset the impact of unfavorable weather, lower sales and a higher effective tax rate, we've taken actions throughout the year to reduce expenses in order to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result of these actions, we expect our 2009 earnings to be near the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. At the same time, we're meeting our financial objectives. We're also providing excellent customer service and reliability to our customers, where we've seen improvements in both customer satisfaction and reliability indicators in 2009. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Sparby, who'll walk you through the third quarter details and provide a regulatory update.
David M. Sparby: Thanks. As Ben mentioned we reported third quarter earnings of $0.48 per share compared to $0.51 per share a year ago. Let's now take a look at the details, starting with the review on the quarterly results at each of our subsidiaries. Third quarter earnings at PSCo were flat. The positive impact of the electric rate increase that went into effect in July was offset by rising costs and unfavorable weather. At NSP-Minnesota, third quarter earnings declined by $0.05 per share. This decline resulted largely from cooler than normal temperatures, a higher effective tax rate and timing of nuclear outage costs. At SPS, earnings increased by $0.03 per share for the quarter. We continue to financial results due to 2009 electric rate increases in Texas and New Mexico and the resolution of fuel cost issues. At NSP-Wisconsin, earnings were flat compared with third quarter last year. As we look at the quarter on a consolidated basis there are lots of ups and downs that explain the $0.03 per share decline. So it can really be summarized in two words, weather and taxes. We experienced very cool temperatures this summer which reduced earnings $0.05 per share when compared to normal temperatures and $0.04 per share when compared to last year. Couple of interesting facts on third quarter weather. In Minneapolis, there were 40% less cooling degree days than normal. While in Denver, it was 26% less cooling degree days than normal. In addition, in both cities, there was less the half the number of days exceeding 90 degrees compared to normal which is just all another way of saying, it was really cool this summer. Now as you read through our earnings release, you may have noticed that our quarterly effective tax rate was 38.4% for 2009 compared with 35.3% for 2008. The impact of a higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. It was primarily due to the recognition of additional state unitary tax expense and the establishment of evaluation allowance against certain state tax credit carryovers. As a result, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to approach 36%. Next I'll provide more detail regarding drivers that affect various lines of the income statement during the quarter. Electric margin increased by 85 million during the quarter. This was largely driven by rate increases in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin. These rate changes increased electric margin by 98 million. Conservation revenue, non-fuel riders and the MERP rider all served to increase retail electric margin by a total of 27 million. It's important to recognize that these increases in the conservation revenue recovery are largely offset by higher conservation and DSM expense. A couple of factors partially offset these positive results including cooler summer temperatures which reduced margin by 26 million, accruals to record a customer refund of 25 million. This adjustment largely related to a decision in the Minnesota rate case to extend the depreciable life of our Prairie Island nuclear plant. This is offset by lower depreciation expense and finally, higher capacity cost primarily at SPS which reduced margins by 11 million. Turning to expenses, third quarter O&M expenses increased about 44 million or 10% compared with 2008. As we've discussed previously, in the third quarter 2008, the Minnesota Commission approved our deferral and amortization accounting recommendation for nuclear refueling outages effective to the beginning of 2008. This decision resulted in a year-to-date reduction of previously expensed outage costs and the deferral of revenue associated with the recovery of the nuclear outage expenses. The timing of this adjustment resulted in an O&M deviation of $27 million for the quarter. In addition, we have experienced rising benefit cost for pension, medical expense and higher nuclear operating costs. As Ben mentioned, we've taken action to manage our O&M expenses and will continue to so as we finish the year. While we're taking steps to reduce costs, we will not sacrifice customer service or reliability. As you look at the quarterly deviations in our annual guidance, you will note that depreciation expense is lower than previously expected. This reflects the recent Minnesota Commission decision to extend the depreciable life of Prairie Island by 10 years which reduced both the rate increase and the depreciation expense. Next, I'll touch on some recent regulatory developments and our major jurisdictions. First in Minnesota, the PUC recently approved $91 million rate relief based on a 10.88 return on equity. The primary difference between our request and the level of the approved by the Commission was the recognition for rate making purposes of a 10 year life extension for our Prairie Island nuclear facility. This decision lowered both our revenue requirement and our annual depreciation and decommissioning expenses by about $40 million. This adjustment will not affect net income but it will reduce cash flow. Overall, we view the decision as a constructive outcome. In Colorado, we have a pending request seeking an electric rate increase of $177 million based on a 2010 forecast test year and an 11.25% return on equity. In September 2009, interveners filed testimony recommending rate increases below our request based on an adjusted historic test year. In mid-October, we filed our rebuttal testimony which included a proposed earnings test to address intervener concerns regarding the forward test year. Hearings have started and we expect a decision before year-end with new rates effective January 2010. While the intervener testimony is disappointing, we remain optimistic we'll reach a constructive outcome in this rate case much like we've done in the past. In June, we filed a request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by 30 million and proposed no change in our natural gas rates. This request is based on an ROE of 10.75% and a 2010 forecast test year. Staff recommended a rate increase of 14.5 million based on a 10.75 ROE and a 51.6 equity ratio, about 6.5 million of this staff's recommendation is the result of changes in depreciation for the life of Prairie Island. We expect a decision by year-end and new rates effective in January 2010. Also in June, we filed a request to increase South Dakota electric rates by $19 million based on an ROE of 11.25% and a 2008 historic test year with adjustments for known and measurable changes. This is the first rate case we filed in South Dakota since 1992. We expect a decision by year-end with new rates effective January 2010. That includes my prepared comments. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Ben for some closing remarks.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Thanks, Dave. Historically, we've issued our next year's earnings guidance on our third quarter earnings call. However, due to pending rate cases, we plan to issue 2010 earnings guidance later in the year. Let me give you some insight into 2010. The key driver is clearly the Colorado rate case where we expect a decision by year-end. Rate increases in Wisconsin and South Dakota will also have an impact, however, to a lesser extent. We expect electric sales will bottom in 2009 and grow about 1% in 2010. While we continue to strive to keep costs down, we expect O&M expenses will continue to increase driven largely by nuclear costs, pension and medical expenses and plant additions. Depreciation expense will increase and AFUDC earnings will decrease due to the completion of major projects like Comanche 3, Fort St. Vrain and the river side repowering. In summary, the combination of cool weather, a higher effective tax rate and a sluggish economy has made it a challenging year. That being said, we remain committed to achieving our financial objectives and providing value for our shareholders. We're confident we will deliver earnings within our guidance range. So with that I'll turn it back over to Dave and open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question does come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Paul Patterson: Good morning guys.
David Sparby: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Patterson: Just on the tax issue, how should we think of 2010, what's the tax rate that we should be thinking about now in 2010?
David Sparby: Paul we'll provide more guidance later in the year. One of the factors that affected our effective tax rate this year was bonus depreciation which will expire at the end of the year.
Paul Patterson: Okay. And then when you talked about Colorado in the forward test year and your disappointing intervener testimony as you saw it. Is there any possibility of settlement in Colorado? Or we really passed that point and time?
David Sparby: Colorado is always the possibility for settlement up until the time of the Commission's decision.
Paul Patterson: Okay. When we're talking about -- you guys have gone through a large number of rate cases, and by the end of this year or by the beginning of next year, really most of these things will be completed. How should we think about the regulatory landscape or your plans to go in for additional regulatory relief or when you might need to do so? Just sort of generally speaking after all that you've sort of accomplished so far, obviously depends on once you sort of get a certain degree in some of these jurisdictions that haven't come out. But could you give a little bit of a flavor for that?
David Sparby: Paul, at this time, we're looking at our gas assets here at Minnesota and considering a rate change in this jurisdiction, we're also looking at our wholesale rates in our Colorado jurisdiction and those are what we're seeing in the near-term for rate relief.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Paul, this is Ben. I would just say it would -- we continue to invest very heavily in our infrastructure and into the environment within all our jurisdictions. So I think you can expect that we'll be filing rate cases fairly routinely in all our jurisdictions. But that's what we've been doing obviously in over the last few years.
Paul Patterson: Okay. So by routinely you mean within 12 months or so we might be seeing new rate cases being filed on the -- and I know you guys will have a lot of clauses and stuff as well, so we might be actually seeing more general rate cases coming out of these jurisdictions the next?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: I wouldn't say every 12 months. Paul as you know one of the reasons -- one of the helpful things about riders et cetera is that it helps minimize the -- how often you have to file rate cases and how large those rate cases are and one of the things I think we've been successful in is not having to ask for double-digit kind of increases basically. So...
Paul Patterson: Okay. And then just finally, when you're talking to your industrial customers and your large commercial customers, what is their expectation for the economy in 2010? Do you have any general sense as to what your people on the field are gathering from your discussions with major consumers of electricity?
David Sparby: Our estimates for sales as Ben discussed about 1% reflects generally the consensus of those customers Paul. We developed our forecast in part based on their expectations, together with our modeling of their historic usage and bringing that together with some broader indicators from global insights and we found in the areas we serve very much a consensus around that 1% figure. So it's a slow recovery.
Paul Patterson: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
David Sparby: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Jenkins: Hi, good morning. I was curious on the O&M expense, the biggest side in those nuclear outage cost deferrals and so forth and kind of the change of the timing of that and I was wondering -- looking forward into 2010, how should we think about that, given the changes that have gone on there, do you expect that –to be basically flat year-over-year, go down based on schedule -- what should we be thinking there?
David Sparby: Dan, it will vary a little bit depending on the outage schedule but as we move through an outage of each of the units this year we will see that expense become much more normalized from year-to-year.
Dan Jenkins: Okay. And then similarly given the Comanche plant supposed to go online in the fourth quarter here, how will that impact O&M in 2010?
David Sparby: It will have an increase in our generation cost for O&M in PSCo.
Dan Jenkins: You have a sense  of how big of an impact that will be?
David Sparby: I -- go ahead Scott Wilensky.
Scott Wilensky: It's around 16 million a year but that's part of rate request pending in Colorado right now.
Dan Jenkins: Okay. And then I was wondering if you have the year-to-date through September CapEx and cash flow from the operations?
David Sparby: Yes, cash flow for operations is 1.6 billion and CapEx is 1.3 billion.
Dan Jenkins: Okay. Thank you. That's all I have.
David Sparby: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question does come from the line of Andrew Levi with Incremental Capital. Please go ahead.
Andrew Levi: Hi. Good morning guys.
David Sparby: Good morning.
Andrew Levi: I've just been watching your rate cases and recommendations and thing like that, is it becoming more difficult environment do you believe because doesn't seem like you're getting the same type of recommendations or increases or ROEs that you're able to get a year or two ago. Is the environment tougher and is it going to be tougher as you go in for more increases?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Andrew, this is Ben Fowke and I just at the rate case, test the plan, I think a lot of people in this room are going to be -- I think it's proceeding just the way a typical rate case would and I think historically we've had some pretty constructive settlements. The last big one was in Minnesota where we settled with 10.88 and had a number of issues I thought constructively resolved as David mentioned on the call. So I think one of the things we're done a good job is continue even in these troubled economic times is receive constructive regulatory outcomes and I think a lot of it has to do with the alignment we have with our stake holders and state policies that were implementing. Dave I don't know if you...
David Sparby: I agree.
Scott Wilensky: I think we're doing pretty well all things consider.
Andrew Levi: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference to Dave Sparby.
David Sparby: I want to thank you all for participating in our third quarter earnings call this morning. I look forward to meeting with many of you at the EEI Financial Conference next week. In addition, I hope you will join us in New York on December 2nd for our Annual Investor Meeting. This year we plan to introduce some new presenters that will provide unique perspectives on our company. If you have any follow-up question, Paul Johnson and the IR teams are available to take your calls. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Xcel Energy third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. We do thank you for your participation on today's call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Xcel Energy's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the formal presentation, instructions will be given for the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 30, 2009. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Paul Johnson, who is the Managing Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin the conference at this time.
Paul Johnson: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's second quarter 2009 earnings release conference call. With me today are Ben Fowke, Executive Vice President and CFO for Xcel Energy, Teresa Madden, Vice President and Controller, Scott Wilensky, VP Regulatory and Resource Planning, Dave Sparby, President and CEO NSP Minnesota, and Jim Altman, Vice President, Deputy General Counsel. Today, we plan to cover our second quarter results and provide a general business update. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of the comments may contain forward-looking information, significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated, are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. You will notice that today's press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Since there wasn't a material difference between GAAP and ongoing earnings, we refer to GAAP earnings during the morning's discussion. With that, I will turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul, and welcome everyone. This morning we reported second quarter 2009 earning of $117 million or $0.25 per share compared with $106 million, $0.24 per share in 2008. In general, higher electric margin, primarily from rate relief, coupled with management actions to control costs, served to offset a steeper than expected decline in retail electric sales, and resulted in a $0.01 per share increase for the quarter. Let us look into the details, starting with the review of our quarterly results at each of our subsidiaries. Second quarter earnings at PSCo were down $0.02 per share, largely due to rising costs and relatively flat sales margin. In May, the Colorado commission approved an annual electric rate increase of $112 million and rates went into effect earlier this month. We expect these new rates to help offset rising costs and sluggish sales over the second half of the year. At NSP-Minnesota, second quarter earnings were flat. We have a pending rate case in Minnesota with interim rates which are subject to refund. Interim rates provided incremental revenue and cost recovery, which partially offset declining sales and increased costs. At SPS, earnings increased by $0.02 per share for the quarter. We are seeing improved financial results due to electric rate increases in Texas and New Mexico, and the resolution of fuel cost issues in 2008. At NSP-Wisconsin, earnings of $0.01 per share were flat, compared with the second quarter of last year. Finally, our investment in WYCO, which owns a new gas pipeline in Colorado that, began operating in late 2008, contributing earnings of $0.01 per share.  Now let's take a closer look at our consolidated results. Second quarter 2009 earnings increased $0.01 per share, which was largely driven by higher electric margin which increased earnings by $0.07 per share. Partially offsetting a positive impact of electric margin were higher O&M expenses which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, dilution from our 2008 equity issuance direct and benefit plans, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share, and higher interest expense, lower gas margins, and other items which reduced earnings by a total of $0.03 per share. Next, I will provide more detail on some of the key drivers for the quarter. Electric margin increased by $52 million during the quarter, driven largely by retail rate increases in several of our jurisdictions. Interim rates in Minnesota combined with new rates in Texas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin increased retail electric margin by $43 million. Conservation revenue, non-fuel riders and the MERP rider all served to increase retail electric margin by a total of $26 million. Finally, while weather was cooler than normal, it was warmer than last year, which improved electric margin by $7 million. A couple of factors partially offset these positive results, including higher capacity costs, which reduced margins by $15 million, and a decline in weather adjusted electric sales, which reduced margins by $16 million. However, the impact was tempered by changes in sales mix and demand revenue from C&I customers, which mitigated about half the quarterly impact of declining sales. The recession and its impact on sales have been a key factor all year. In fact, second quarter weather normalized electric retail sales decreased 3.2%, which was worse than we anticipated. Residential sales declined 0.7% during the quarter, which was comparable to the decline we experienced first quarter. However, the sales trend weakened in the commercial and industrial class, where electric sales declined 4.2% for the second quarter compared with a 1.4% decline in the first quarter. Overall, the recession impacted each of our service territories. While we continue to add customers at about 1% every year, those increases have been more than offset by declines in electric consumption. We believe the declines are due to the recession, conservation, and a relatively mild summer, particularly in the north, which makes it easier to conserve energy. On a year-to-date basis, our weather adjusted sales declined 2.2%. We think the recession will continue to dampen C&I sales the rest of the year. On the residential side, we don't anticipate the recent trend will worsen. Remember that residential sales started to decline in the second half of 2008, so the comparative forecast starts from a lower base. In total, we are lowering our annual weather adjusted electric sales forecast to reflect a decline of 2%. While we clearly don't have a crystal ball, we feel this is a realistic forecast based on current information. Turning to expenses, second quarter O&M expenses increased about $16 million or 3.4%, largely due to outage timing, higher nuclear related expenses, and higher employee benefit costs, which included increased pension and medical costs. Those results were partially offset by lower consulting and material cost. We have taken several steps to manage our O&M expenses, including reducing and deferring annual merit expenses, cutting travel expenses and consulting costs. These cost reductions are reflected in our annual O&M guidance and will not affect customer service or reliability. That explains the significant quarterly deviations. Now I would like to provide you a brief regulatory update. Let me start with the rate cases that we have recently resolved. In May, the Colorado commission approved $112 million electric rate increase with new rates effective in July. In Texas, the commission recently approved a $57 million rate increase; interim rates were put in place in February. In July, the New Mexico commission approved a $14 million rate increase with new rates effective in July. In all three cases, we have reached constructive settlements with major interveners which helped minimize regulatory lag. Next, let me turn to our pending rate cases. We are nearing the end of the Minnesota electric rate case process, where interim rates of $132 million subject to refund went into effect in January. We are seeking an increase of $136 million, which does not reflect any change in the depreciation life at our Prairie Island nuclear plant. We also filed an alternative request for $119 million, based on a three-year depreciation life extension for Prairie Island. This lower revenue request wouldn't affect net income but would affect cash flow. Interveners have submitted testimony and hearings have been completed. At the time of the hearings, the Office of Energy Security recommended a revenue increase of $90 million based on a 10.88% ROE. They also recommended a 10-year life extension of Prairie Island, which results in a $40 million decrease in depreciation and decommissioning expense. Again, this recommended life extension wouldn't affect net income, but would reduce our cash flows. With the exception of the differences in depreciation life for Prairie Island, the OES recommendation is very close to our revised request. We expect the recommendation from the ALJ in August and a final decision from the Minnesota commission in October. In May, we filed a request to increase electric rates in Colorado by $180 million, based on a 2010 forecast test year, an 11.25% ROE, rate base of $4.4 billion, and an equity ratio of 58%. This rate request is driven by capital investment in Colorado, and includes recovery of costs associated with Comanche 3 and Fort St. Vrain, which go into service this year. It also reflects rising pension and medical costs. Intervener testimony is scheduled to be filed in September. We expect a decision before year end with new rates effective in January of 2010. In June, we filed a request to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by $30 million or 5.7%, and propose no change in our natural gas rates. This request is based on an ROE of 10.75%, an equity ratio of 53%, and electric rate base of $644 million, and a gas rate base of $81 million in a 2010 forecasted test year. We expect a decision by year end with new rates effective in January of 2010. Also in June, we filed a request to increase South Dakota electric rates by about $19 million based on an ROE of 11.25%, rate base of $282 million, and equity ratio approximately 52%, and a 2008 historic test year with adjustments for known and measurable changes. This is the first rate case we filed in South Dakota since 1992. We expect a decision by year end with rates in effect in January of 2010.  In closing, while 2009 has proven to be a challenging year, our year-to-date earnings are $0.04 ahead of last year. The recession has resulted in declining sales. However, changes in sales mix and demand revenue from commercial and industrial customers have softened the impact on our financial results. Weather has also been challenging. Year-to-date mild temperatures have reduced earnings by $0.02 compared with normal. In addition, we are also experiencing unseasonably cool weather throughout our service territory this summer, which we expect will reduce earnings by $0.03 to $0.04 per share in July. That being said, we have done a good job of managing these challenges and have taken appropriate steps to offset the impact of declining sales, unfavorable weather, and higher benefit cost. To summarize, we have received constructive regulatory decisions in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. We have effectively managed our O&M expenses by reducing costs in areas with no direct impact to our customers. We have been able to lower our projected interest expense forecast due to improved working capital and lower interest rates, and we are experiencing improved AFUDC equity earnings. We now expect AFUDC equity earnings to increase $5 million to $10 million versus our most recent forecast of zero. As a result, our business plan remains solidly on track, and we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from…
Ben Fowke: [Abdullah]?
Unidentified Analyst: Can you hear me?
Ben Fowke: Now we can, Abdullah. How are you doing?
Unidentified Analyst: Couple of things; one, can you remind us the big driving items behind the current Colorado rate case and in terms of the request and kind of what protections you currently have in terms of having them predetermined et cetera? Secondarily, can you currently talk your latest views on capital spending and relative to cash flows and where various opportunities such as renewables and those types of things stand?
Ben Fowke: Sure. Let me take the first one which is the 2010 forecasted test year in Colorado, where we are asking for $180 million of rate release. Abdullah that is driven largely by capital additions. Comanche 3, as you know, that is our coal plant that will come into service later this fall, commercial operations early 2010 at a very good price point for our customers. I think it is going to do a lot for the state. We also have Fort St. Vrain that is coming in well under budget as well. So those are the big capital drivers. Then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing rising pension and medical costs that will be the lion's share of the O&M type of relief that we are looking for. I think your second question was related to capital expenditures, particularly on the renewables, was that correct?
Unidentified Analyst: Capital expenditures in general, in terms of matching up operating cash flows to CapEx within the current balance sheet and as well as kind of what your current view is as to the level of potential renewables. We have been seeing and hearing anecdotally about some slowdown in terms of commitments and pushing out of various renewable, potential renewable spending.
Ben Fowke: Well, they are kind of related for us, because as you know, we are in the process of getting final stage approval for the projects, the wind projects, one in North Dakota, one in Minnesota, all at NSP-Minnesota that will increase our CapEx over the next couple of years, also put us ahead of the milestones towards meeting those RPF standards. So, that will basically be what we are concentrating on for renewables in Minnesota. In Colorado, we have an RFP outstanding, and you might recall, Abdullah, that earlier in the year we reduced that overall RFP by 500 megawatts, but we did not reduce the renewable component of that which I believe is 850 megawatts, again, that keeps us ahead of meeting our milestones in Colorado for the RPF standards. In regards to overall capital expenditures, you have some flexibility there related to what is happening with sales and the economy and that sort of thing. That flexibility will be reflected, but I mean, by enlarge, Abdullah most of our capital expenditures are going to be related to long-term resource planning decisions and transmission and infrastructure work that needs to get done. The good news is cash flow has been pretty good for us. Working capital as I mentioned in my remarks has improved significantly this year over the last. So, I think we are in pretty good shape.
Unidentified Analyst: As I recall, I am trying to remember I think the CapEx range is like between 1.8 and 2.3?
Ben Fowke: Yes. 1.8 this year and it is 2.3 next. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: The $0.03 to $0.04 of reduction that you cited in your comments for July from the weather…
Ben Fowke: Yes.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Is that just from what you have seen in this month, or was that a year-to-date by the end of July number?
Ben Fowke: No, unfortunately, that is just what we have seen in July. 
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay.
Ben Fowke: July has been one of the coldest months on record here in Minnesota, and it hasn't been particularly warm in Colorado, Travis, but we understand the challenge of weather, and we obviously understood that weather was going to be a challenge that we face in the second half of the year and then we think we have taken action since the beginning of the year to mitigate that, and frankly, we think we are near the middle of our guidance range even with the weather. So we like it to be warmer, but it is not and we will take actions to address it.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Sure. A bit of a follow-up on that. Those O&M costs that you have been able to cut and contain, are those more one-time items or ongoing? What kind of balance is there?
Ben Fowke: Well, they are not deferrals. I mean, so you won't see more pressure on our 2010 O&M forecast as a result of what we are doing in 2009, but some of its productivity, some of it is just tightening our belts as we think it is appropriate to do with employee expenses, consulting, that sort of thing, deferring merit raises, controlling contract labor, controlling overtime, and that is I guess in the productivity side. Travis, the other thing we are seeing is one of the natural things you see with cooler weather and less sales is [like strain] on your system, and we are seeing less severity of summer storms and things like that. So it all adds up to cuts that don't boomerang again and come back to you in 2010.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [William Hedstrom with Kalispell]. Please go ahead.
William Hedstrom - Kalispell: On supervision and guidance for electric retail sales, can you provide kind of a geographic breakdown on your growth assumptions and how your northern jurisdictions are faring as compared to Colorado or SPS?
Ben Fowke: Yes, I can. I mean, it is more pronounced in the north. The second quarter, would you prefer quarter or year-to-date?
William Hedstrom - Kalispell: Year-to-date.
Ben Fowke: Year-to-date in NSP-Minnesota, we are down 3.2%. These are all weather normalized. PSCo, it is a little less at 2%. SPS is negative 1% and NSP-Wisconsin is negative 1.2%. By enlarge residential isn't being too impacted with the exception of NSP-Minnesota, where we are feeling it a little bit more. I think in part that maybe because this is really the second year in a row where we have had a pretty mild summer, and when you combine that with the recessionary impact, I think people are basically not using air conditioning as much and they can do so because it is quite comfortable up here right now. On the C&I side, quarter, basically there were reductions across the board year-to-date. It is more pronounced at NSP-Minnesota than in any of our other jurisdictions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ishar Khan with Incremental Capital. Please go ahead at this time.
Ishar Khan - Incremental Capital: I guess you kind of answered the question. So you said you are on track to meet the mid point of the guidance at this point as you look at things.
Ben Fowke: I think even with the weather, Ishar, we are near the mid point of our guidance, and as you know, that as you read the press release, included in our O&M estimates still is the full amount of our annual incentives, which unfortunately last year we cut completely. So I think we are in good shape to certainly meet guidance and I think at this point we are near the middle of that guidance range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead at this time.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: So if I just go to note six and I just look at all the puts and takes and use sort of the mid point of what has changed since Q1, would it be fair to say that your top line revenue is expected to be about $50 million lower, and you found about $50 million of cost cutting and a little bit of AFUDC to offset that?
Ben Fowke: I think $50 million might be a bit high to tell you the truth, perhaps if you add weather on top of that.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Ben Fowke: I mean, since the beginning of the year, Greg, basically through O&M, AFUDC, interest expense, a number of items, we had improvements of $0.07 or $0.08. I think that basically offsets the weather and the sales decline that we have seen.
Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Now, when I look at, at least what we have seen so far, the limited number of companies that have reported, in the Southeast and in the Midwest, we are seeing sales declines on the commercial and industrial segment of 15% to 17%, and even on weather normalized basis, they are in the double digits. You guys have seen a much, much more muted reduction in commercial and industrial sales on both the normal and weather adjusted basis. So I don't know if you are in a position to compare and contrast your territory to others, but what is driving the more muted decline?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think a couple things. I mean, one, while we are suffering from a recession, I think if you look at the unemployment numbers, et cetera, our jurisdictions typically are about a full two percentage point better than the national average, but I think probably the biggest driver, Greg, is the fact that we don't have a large manufacturing base. As you move east and across our northern jurisdictions, you see more manufacturing. We have a large commercial base, but not as much on the [high] side of that, and where we do have industrial load, it tends to be energy and mining related, and while we have seen slowdowns there, it is certainly not been as severe as some of the other manufacturing sectors of the economy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: On your page 6 of your release where you breakdown the revenues, I was wondering if the first line there, the retail rate increases, if you could break that down further the six-month number by the states in the Minnesota, Texas, Wisconsin in those states.
Ben Fowke: Yes. I can. Let me…
Paul Johnson: Why don't you give me a call after the call, and we can walk through that. I mean, if you look at the rate increases and like for example Minnesota is $132 million interim rate, you can take about half that, and then if you want I will walk you through the rest of them after the call.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. Another question I have was you talk about the higher nuclear plant operating costs and related to some changes in regulation. I was wondering at what point that not becomes a year-over-year increase of that. Does at some point the comparison year over year kind of go away because of that change?
Ben Fowke: There is two components that you should think about, Dan. I mean, one is the outage cost, which as you remember, we had an accounting change last year. So we still are on track to see that overall even though from year-to-date it is flat, in fact, minus $1 million. It will be at that $35 million level by the end of the year. I think your question, though, is pointed to the other line item on nuclear plant operating costs which are up $8 million quarter-to-quarter and $16 million year to date, is that correct?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Right.
Ben Fowke: Is your question what is driving that?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: No, since you have explained what is driving that I was curious it says it is driven by an increase in security costs and regulatory fees resulting from new NRC requirements. At some point, does the year-over-year affect zero out, you know what I am saying? So you have had this change in security costs. When did that go into effect? Was that like start at the beginning of '09 so in 2010 it won't be a year-over-year delta, you know what I am saying?
Ben Fowke: Yes, I know what you are saying. I think that trend line will probably continue unfortunately, because I mean we are seeing and it is not just this year, it has been over several years now a lot of increased security requirements, worker fatigue requirements, increased NRC fees and they are not going away. They just keep coming. Historically, we have run a pretty lean labor force at our plants. So as those are new requirements for worker fatigue and security have come on, we have had to hire the personnel to address it. That is what you need to do, and that is what we are doing.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. So, that is a trend that you don't expect to change then?
Ben Fowke: I don't think it really levellizes out, not this year, anyway. Teresa, Scott, do you see anything different?
Teresa Madden: No.
Ben Fowke: Okay.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Then kind of the next thing on the nuclear; I was wondering do you know what your year-to-date capacity factors are?
Ben Fowke: Yes. They have been I believe in the upper 80s, low 90s.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. Then I noticed you had put out what the 2008 ROEs were, and I noticed it was 799 for Minnesota gas.
Ben Fowke: Yes.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Are you considering filing a rate case for the Minnesota gas?
Ben Fowke: I think that is under consideration, but why don't we have Scott address that.
Scott Wilensky: We are looking at that right now. We noticed the same thing, and we are running look at our budget, and if it warrants an increase, we are prepared to file.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Seitz with Dudack Research Group. Please go ahead at this time.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research Group: I just was wondering if you could give us a bit of color on what you anticipate in terms of the economy next year. Do you see a relatively early recovery or actually not? Just give us a color of what you see in your territories.
Ben Fowke: Yes. You know, Danielle, I don't know if I can really provide any more insight than what we all read in the paper. I am hopeful that we are at the bottom, but my sources are probably the same as your sources. We were a bit surprised at the second quarter impact. We don't believe it will get worse, but I don't see any signs, frankly, that it is going to get better any time soon either and hence our forecast for the sales this year. I wish I could provide more insight, but I am just guessing.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research Group: No, I mean obviously [for us] any insight is good from where we stand. It is always easier when you can tell us what you hear from the different C&I customers and so on.
Ben Fowke: Yes and then I think for us again as we talked about earlier, I mean, a lot of our C&I is more on the sea side. So I think in general those things are harder to get your arms around, but they will tend to I assume move up as the economy just generally improves.
Danielle Seitz - Dudack Research Group: My other question; do you see an increase in AFUDC? Can you tell us where it comes from given that you are done with Comanche 3 and all that? I was wondering what was the impetus for the upside in AFC.
Ben Fowke: Well, we have changed it twice. We changed it on the first quarter and first quarter, I believe, was primarily driven by the rate settlement we entered into in Colorado with Comanche 3 where we chose to recognize AFUDC versus quick recovery in the rates. The most recent revision to the forecast is more a series of cats and dogs and just more of the budgeting forecasting process as we have gotten into the year and can't really point to anything specific.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead at this point.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Actually, Danielle just asked my AFUDC question so I am all set.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead at this time.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: I am sorry I missed this. I got distracted right when you guys were discussing it. The O&M outlook this year versus 2010, you were discussing that. Could you just review that? I am sorry to ask you to review that again.
Ben Fowke: I don't think we have talked about the O&M outlook for 2010. I think what you probably came in the middle of is the fact that the reductions that we are making in 2009 are not going to be reductions that then bounce right back into our 2010 forecast, Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: So they are sustainable?
Ben Fowke: Yes.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. There are also some O&M items seem to be unusual. If I understood correctly it seems that there was some O&M increases that from reading the release that may not be showing up next year. Is that right?
Ben Fowke: I mean, do you have something specific? I mean…
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Well, I was thinking on the nuclear side.
Ben Fowke: Oh, yes. That is really what we are seeing this year is related to that change in the amortization accounting that was approved by the commission last year. So we are still on track as per our guidance to have outage accounting be an increase of $35 million this year. Then I believe correct me if I am wrong, Teresa, it starts to levellize out in 2010. She is nodding yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead at this time.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: I wanted to ask just generally as you look at growth and your long-term growth rate, I know you have received the question about how sustainable your growth rate is in a recessionary environment. Just near term, if we have perhaps beleaguered growth in the economic environment, will Xcel grow in line with what it is grown historically?
Ben Fowke: I mean, will we grow in line with our long-term outlook of 5% to 7%?
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Yes.
Ben Fowke: Yes, I think we will. I think the reality though is in a recessionary time it is probably going to be closer to the five, but I don't think it pushes you below that.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Thank you. Also just on with regard to the CapEx 2020 plan, can you just give us an update on that and I know there has been some opposition, it seems like Minnesota has agreed with your point of view, but could you just give us more of perhaps a definitive timeline and investment on that.
Ben Fowke: Yes. I will ask Dave or Scott if they want to chime in, but I think, remember the big thing was the certificate of need that we received earlier in the year and the next steps as we talked about was the routing and the permitting for the specific routes. We have seen opposition, but that is kind of I think natural. Dave or Scott, do you want to add anything to that?
Scott Wilensky: I don't think there is anything unusual in the level of opposition on that project. I think, actually it has got a significant level of support that we don't typically see around some transmission projects that moved through the PUC process as well as the largest CoN granted by that commission for transmission. So, there is going to be some natural noise around it, but again, I think it is moving fairly smoothly.
Ben Fowke: It takes a long time, Nathan, to get those complaining to construction.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: You have done a great job of getting them along so far so, best of luck. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Sara Eikers with Wells Fargo]. Please go ahead.
Sara Eikers - Wells Fargo: Can you elaborate on the D&A expense item? It looks like there is about a $30 million improvement since Q1. Is there any driver besides what you kind of mentioned about the AFUDC with the clarity on the budgeting? Anything else you can point to that is driving the declines there?
Ben Fowke: Yes. I would say that most of those reductions too, Sara, are not going to be earnings impacted, because they really reflect commission orders that had been basically swept into the rate relief that we are now getting. They relate to a number of things, but I think typically our nuclear plants have been the big drivers.
Sara Eikers - Wells Fargo: Okay. That is helpful.
Ben Fowke: That is already incorporated into the rate relief.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Yates with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead at this time.
Matthew Yates - Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to follow-up on the CapEx outlook and some of the comments you have made about a very uncertain macro backdrop and equally (inaudible) a lot of uncertainty on the federal regulations side in term of the energy bill. Can you say to what extent this impacts any of your CapEx decisions in the near term? Thanks a lot.
Ben Fowke: I don't think it really does. When you think about what is happening with federal climate change and that legislation, I mean, I think it validates the fact that we have been on the right path for a number of years now and that the things that we are doing, adding wind both contractually and building our own, upgrading our nuclear plants to not only be at a great price point for our customers but provide carbon free energy. I mean those were all the things that you want to do. We have been preparing for what we thought was eventually going to happen, which would be climate change. These are long-term decisions. You obviously need to be sensitive to the economic times, but I think if you keep your regulatory compact solid and you keep your balance sheet strong, you can continue to execute on your long-term strategy even in these recessionary times.
Matthew Yates - Merrill Lynch: If I can follow-up on something, if you look at the trend right now in terms of solar module costs or wind turbine prices, can you talk about the discussions you are having with some of your energy providers about where PPA prices might be moving?
Ben Fowke: Well, I will be able to talk a lot more about that as we get through the RFP process in Colorado. I guess, just in general, there has been I guess some improvement in pricing. Certainly, that is related to the economy, I would say, with wind, but in solar it is more technology and breakthroughs and frankly commodity prices that the silicons that go into the panels that are driving the price down there.
Operator: Gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions in the queue. Please continue with any closing comments that you may have.
Ben Fowke: I appreciate everybody joining the call, and as always, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to call Paul Johnson and the rest of the IR team. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation on today's call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Ben Fowke - Chief Financial Officer Paul Johnson - Managing Director, Investor Relations
Analysts: Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Daniele Seitz - Dudak Research Group  Ishar Khan [Ph] - INCO Sara Ingram - Wachovia  
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s first quarter 2009 earnings release conference call. I am Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. With me today is Ben Fowke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy, and several others who can help answer your questions.  Today we plan to cover our first quarter results and provide a business update. In addition, we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings guidance. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of the comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. You will notice that today’s press release refers to both GAAP and ongoing earnings. Since there was no material difference between GAAP and ongoing earnings, we will refer to GAAP earnings during today’s presentation. With that, I will turn the call over to Ben Fowke.
Ben Fowke: Thanks Paul and welcome everyone. We are pleased to report first quarter 2009 earnings were $174 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to $153 million or $0.35 per share in 2008. I will start with a quick review of the quarterly results of our subsidiaries. First quarter earnings at PSCo declined by $0.05 per share, largely due to the declining sales growth, unfavorable temperatures, and rising costs.  As many of you know, we have reached a settlement in our electric rate case in Colorado, which is pending commission approval and rates are expected to go into effect in July. In Minnesota, we also have a pending rate increase; however, interim rates which are subject to refund went into effect in January. These interim rates provided incremental revenue and cost recovery. As a result, earnings increased $0.02 per share for the quarter.  At SPS, earnings increased by $0.03 per share for the quarter. We are seeing improved financial results due to initiatives to resolve fuel cost allocation issues and regulatory lag, and while we aren’t earning our authorized return at SPS, we have taken a step in the right direction.  At NSP, Wisconsin, earnings increased by $0.01 per share, due to improved fuel recovery. Finally, our investment in WYCO, which owns a new gas pipeline in Colorado that began operating in late 2008, contributed earnings of $0.01 per share.  Next, I thought it would be helpful to discuss a handful of the key drivers and events that influenced the consolidated quarterly results and may affect the rest of the year. First, our quarterly O&M expenses increased at a lower rate than our projected annual rate, due to management actions and the timing of cost recognition in 2008.  Second, our weather adjusted sales growth was negative for the quarter and below our expectations. While this didn’t have a significant impact on the quarter, it is a trend we will need to monitor very closely. Third, we continue to see constructive regulation in our jurisdictions, as evidenced by the rate case settlements we recently reached in Texas and Colorado, and in an agreement in principle in New Mexico.  In addition, the Minnesota Commission granted a certificate of need for our CapEx 2020 transmission project. Minnesota Office of Energy Security also issued testimony in our rate case, and while we don’t agree with all aspects of their testimony, the recommendations were generally balanced and constructive. Fourth, as a result of our strong balance sheet and constructive regulation, we continue to make significant capital investments in our utilities, which will provide long-term value and benefits to both customers and shareholders.  Finally, our business plan remains on track and we are reaffirming our 2009 earnings guidance of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. With that overview, let’s take a closer look at our consolidated results. First quarter 2009 earnings increased by $0.03 per share, compared to last year. This was primarily due to higher electric margins, which increased earnings by $0.11 per share.  Offsetting the positive impact of electric margins were several items, including lower natural gas margins, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, higher O&M expenses which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, dilution from our September equity issuance, DRIP and benefit plans, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share, and other items which combined to reduce earnings by a total of $0.02 per share.  One of the cornerstones of our strategy is constructive regulation, which was a key factor in electric margins increasing by $77 million in the quarter. Electric rate increases in Wisconsin and New Mexico and interim rates in Texas and Minnesota combined to increase electric margin by $45 million. Riders associated with MERP, transmission, renewable energy and conservation, combined to increase the electric margin by a total of $32 million.  For the past several years, we’ve incurred cost disallowances and recorded accruals related to fuel cost allocation issues which have depressed returns at SPS. As a result of various regulatory initiatives and settlements, we’ve largely resolved these issues and are starting to see financial improvement. One area where that is clearly apparent is lower regulatory accruals at SPS, which increased electric margin by $12 million. Finally in 2008, we made filings to improve fuel cost recovery in Wisconsin which increased margin by $9 million.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher purchase capacity costs, which reduced margins by $18 million, and warmer temperatures, resulting in lower electric sales which reduced margins by $6 million. We also experienced negative weather adjusted electric sales growth, which reduced margins by $2 million. The decline in sales growth was most pronounced in the commercial and industrial class; however, because our large customers pay a demand fee, the impact of declining sales was mitigated to a certain degree.  Unfortunately, we didn’t experience the same positive margin trends on the natural gas side of our business, where margins declined by $14 million for the quarter. This was largely due to warmer weather, which reduced gas margins by $10 million and declining sales and other items that combined to reduce natural gas margins by an additional $4 million.  Turning to expenses; first quarter O&M expenses increased by $11 million or 2.4%, largely due to higher employee benefit expenses related to increased pension and medical costs. The O&M increase for the first quarter was lower than the projected annual trend for two reasons management’s actions to reduce costs, and O&M timing in 2008.  As part of our effort to reduce costs, we have deferred the annual merit increase for non-bargaining employees, and have taken steps to reduce consulting and employee costs. These cost reductions are reflected in our annual O&M guidance and will not affect customer service or reliability.  As you develop your quarterly models, you should be aware of a couple of items that affected the timing of our 2008 O&M costs. First of all, in the third quarter of 2008, we reduced our incentive compensation accruals based on expected year end results. This resulted in a year-to-date true-up of previously accrued incentive expenses.  Second, and also in the third quarter of 2008, the Minnesota commission approved our deferral and amortization accounting recommendation for nuclear refueling outages effective January 2008. This decision also resulted in a year-to-date true-up of previously accrued O&M expenses. As a result, O&M expenses were higher in the first half of 2008 and lower in the second half of the year, so O&M comparisons will tend to be more unfavorable in the second half of this year. That explains the significant quarterly deviations.  Now I’d like to discuss current sales trends and our forecasts for the remainder of the year. Six months ago, we had forecasted our 2009 sales would be roughly flat due to the recession. On a consolidated basis, first quarter weather normalized sales decreased 1.2%.  We saw declines in both our residential and commercial and industrial classes. The decline was more pronounced in the C&I class, as weather normalized sales fell 1.4% for the quarter. As a result, we’ve reduced our 2009 retail electric sales forecast to reflect a decline of approximately 1%.  Since the economy is on everyone’s minds these days, I will review with you the economic health of the jurisdictions we operate in. One factor that works in our favor is the diversity of industries throughout our service territory. For example, our 10 largest customers operate in seven different industries, and only generate about 9% of our total electric retail sales.  In addition, unemployment in our jurisdictions was 7.7% at the end of March, which was below the national average of 9%. This trend existed at each of our service territories, where unemployment was 7.9% at NSP, 7.8% at PSCo, and only 4.5% at SPS.  Finally, our regions fared better with respect to mortgage foreclosures. According to realty track, the foreclosure rate through March remains below the national average in each of our service territories. While we aren’t immune to the effects of recession, our service territories are diverse and are doing better than the nation as a whole.  I’d now like to comment on recent developments on the regulatory front. In November 2008, we filed a request to increase electric rates in Minnesota by $156 million or a little over 6%. Interim rates of $132 million went into effect at the beginning of January.  Earlier this month, interveners submitted testimony. The Office of Energy Security recommended a revenue increase of $72 million, based on an ROE of 10.88% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. They also recommended a 10-year life extension of the Prairie Island facility, which results in a $40 million decrease in depreciation and decommissioning. While this adjustment would not affect net income, it would affect cash flow. They are either scheduled for June and a decision is expected in October.  Last November, PSCo filed an electric rate case in Colorado. In March, we filed rebuttal testimony, seeking a rate increase of $159 million. Included in our request was approximately $40 million of return on CWIP for Comanche 3. We recently reached a settlement agreement with most of the interveners, which provides for $112 million rate increase, based on a black box settlement.  The key difference from our request is that we removed the return on CWIP and instead will continue to record AFDC until Comanche 3 goes into service. While it is based on a series of compromises, we are pleased with the settlement, as it provides us with regulatory certainty and the opportunity to earn a reasonable return in 2009 while we make significant investments in Colorado. The settlement is pending commission approval, and a decision is expected this summer. Finally, rates are projected to go into effect on July 1.  We’re also making progress at SPS. In January, we reached a unanimous settlement, which provided an electric rate increase of $57 million in Texas. Interim rates subject to refund went into effect in February. We achieved a settlement in just over seven months, which significantly reduced the lag that would have incurred from litigation. The settlement is pending commission approval, and we expect commission approval later this spring.  Last December, SPS filed to increase electric rates by about $25 million or 6% in New Mexico. In addition, we requested interim rate relief of $7.6 million for capacity cost, associated with the Lea Power Partners project. The New Mexico commission approved an interim rate increase of $5.7 million, effective in May. In April, we reached an agreement and principle on some of the key issues in our New Mexico electric rate case. We will discuss the details of the settlement when it is finalized towards the end of May.  As you can see, we are making progress at SPS. The proposed rate increase in Texas and the settlement in our New Mexico electric rate case, should allow SPS to earn an ROE closer to 8% in 2009. While we aren’t earning our allowed ROE, it is roughly double what SPS has earned in recent years.  In other regulatory news, the Minnesota commission granted the utilities participating in CapEx 2020, a certificate of need to construct three 345 KV transmission lines. The commission also approved provisions to up size the transmission lines to double circuits. The decision illustrates Minnesota’s support for upgrading the region’s transmission system to meet customer demand and to increase access to new resources, including renewable energy in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  Applications for route permits are currently under state review or in development and decisions are expected in 2010. Similar regulatory approvals will be pursued in Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. Permits in those states will be filed in 2009, with decisions expected in 2010. Federal permit applications will also be filed in 2009.  We are obviously quite busy on the regulatory front; however, I think you will agree that despite a challenging environment, we are seeing evidence of constructive regulation in connection with our major electric rate cases. In summary, with a solid first quarter and good progress on our regulatory initiatives, we remain on track to achieve our objectives and we are reaffirming our annual guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share.  So with that, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Citi Investment Research; please go ahead.
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Thanks. Good morning Ben.
Ben Fowke: Good morning to you. 
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: So cutting to the chase and going to note six of the press release and just comparing it to note six from the fourth quarter year end call, there’s changes in five line items, you are now assuming weather adjusted electric sales down 1% versus flat. You talked about that in the comments. A $20 million of improvement in your O&M picture, and then you’re also assuming D&A will be $20 million lower; AFUDC will be low or flat versus down and; I’m assuming that’s because of the rate treatment in Colorado?
Ben Fowke: On the AFUDC?
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Yes. 
Ben Fowke: Yes, it’s really a function Greg, of just adjusting for the actual expenditures and when things come in service, more budgeting true-up than anything else.
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Okay, so the D&A and AFUDC, that’s just as we move through time, you’ve got a better read on it and it’s not a cause on the effect thing with the Colorado decision?
Ben Fowke: Precisely. I think depreciation by the way, we have going down $30 million Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Interest expense, you have down $5 million, I’m presuming we heard this across the board from other companies on earnings calls over the last two days, that just your short term debt expenses and financing costs are projected to be lower.
Ben Fowke: Yes, that’s right. I think we saw significant improvement in working capital in the quarter, almost $300 million of improved working capital. So you also obviously need less short term debt to carry that, plus the forecasts for the inherent interest rate is lower than it actually has turned out to be. 
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Okay great. So unless the economic climate were to decelerate further, you’ve been able to compensate so far for everything you’ve seen.
Ben Fowke: That’s correct. 
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Thank you. 
Ben Fowke: Thank you, Greg.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of (Inaudible) with CVP US [ph]; please go ahead. 
Ben Fowke: Hi Abala.
Unidentified Participant: Hi, good morning, Ben. One thing I want to make sure of; I think in your analyst meeting here in New York, back in December, we talked about the capital program and if I remember the numbers properly, they basically had been brought down to an approximate level of about $1.8 billion on average, over the next few years, which is expected to be roughly in line with internal resources. Can you just review sources and uses right now, the way you are thinking about things?
Ben Fowke: Yes Abala, the 1.8 was related to this year. When we look at the out years, 2010 and 2011, it’s more like $2.3 billion. I think we probably talked about it at that analyst meeting that we will continue to review our capital forecasts and our capital expenditures and adjust them where it makes sense to adjust them with economic conditions, but our forecast in the out years is a bit higher than what you have.
Unidentified Participant: And based on what you are seeing right now, as I recall, most of your capital program is not very lumpy in terms of items. There is a composition of many different items. So in terms of being able to adjust that down, do you anticipate at this point that a modest revision downward for the capital program is probable given the economic outlook, etc or do you feel like that it can be supported at this point?
Ben Fowke: Well, first thing I’d point out is that one of the reasons why CapEx goes up in 2010 and 2011 Abala, is because we’re building two wind farms, one in Minnesota, one in North Dakota, which is approximately a $900 million spend over that time frame; and as you know, we have great recovery and we’re excited about earning some of our renewables.  So when you back that out, then you look at the spend and it’s related to the generation transmission and the other items. A couple of things, I would say. We’ll certainly make sure that we’re taking advantage of the declines in the commodities markets, and making sure that our forecasts reflects the fact that while we are still seeing customers grow, and our customer accounts in the first quarter would increased over the 12-month period by about 1% or around 30,000 customers, it’s slower than where it was. We’ll make sure that we have that.  Then we will look at economic conditions and what they suggest for long term sales growth and we’ll take a look at some of the generation plans that we have. There might be an opportunity to push some of those things out. So I guess the good news is I think we have some flexibility. I think the extra good news is because we’ve been proactive and kept the balance sheet strong, we don’t have to strip out things like wind and other things that we want to do, and that we think are an important part of our strategy.
Unidentified Participant: And two last things and I’ll let someone else ask; one with regards to the $900 million of wind, because of the time period in which it’s being put in for, the 30% cash opportunity from the economic stimulus package and how would that be treated?  Secondarily, given the equity offering that was taken last September, if the capital program remains at current levels, how long does that take you out in terms of the not needing issue equity beyond basically DRIP programs?
Ben Fowke: Well, let’s answer the first question and that I think you’re referring to the opportunity to take ITC versus PTC for the wind investments, and you’re right, that’s a 30% credit after you back out certain items. We are certainly looking at that Abala, but we’ll also balance that against what makes most sense for our customers.  In regards to equity, you are absolutely right too; having gotten that equity out last year, I think that we certainly don’t see the need for equity in the next couple of years. You get beyond that and let’s just see where the economy goes, but I think we’re in very good shape.
Unidentified Participant: Thank you very much. 
Ben Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment; please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hey Dan.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Hi, how are you?
Ben Fowke: Good. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: A couple of questions on your slide three where you show the electric margin change. In the first line there, on the rate increases; can you split that up between the states, Minnesota, Texas, Wisconsin and New Mexico; what the affects were?
Ben Fowke: Yes; you’re talking about the $45 million?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Right. 
Ben Fowke: Yes. I can do that for you, but it might take a few minutes. The interim rate increase in Minnesota is probably the lion’s share of it, Dan. It’s about $30 million. The Texas rate increase is about $9 million; Wisconsin is about $4 million and New Mexico is about $1 million. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, and then on the three lines that show the riders the second, the fourth and the sixth lines, the MERP was all Minnesota right?
Ben Fowke: Yes. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: And how about on the conservation DSM riders and the non fuel ones?
Ben Fowke: The conservation rider is primarily in PSCo for $15 million. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, how about the non-fuel riders?
Ben Fowke: Let’s see, primarily Minnesota.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: And then for all of those rate increases and the riders, are those kinds of increases, things we can expect as the quarters going forward? 
Ben Fowke: Well, of course the interim rates are subject to refund and the pending commission approval, as we discussed. Conservation continues to be an important part of our business, so you will continue to see that.  The MERP riders stay into effect and those plans, they are completed and the projects are completed very successfully I might add, and those riders remain in place until we file our next rate case in Minnesota and then it gets rolled into the rate base. So the short answer is yes.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, that’s all I have. Thanks.
Ben Fowke: Thanks Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc; please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hey Paul.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Hey Ben, how are you?
Ben Fowke: Great. 
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Is there a sensitivity around what 100 basis points of sales does? I know there’s obviously mixed issues in there, but what that does to EPS?
Ben Fowke: Paul, that’s a great question. Typically, I would say that 1% is about $30 million, but what we’re finding is we really need to peel it back and look at what customer class it is in, what jurisdiction it is in, because we didn’t have much of an impact this quarter with declining sales, and we’ve done a lot of analysis on that and it’s really because as I mentioned briefly in the remarks that that decline is with customers that the majority of our recovery is demand versus energy based.  So, now I think that might change with seasonality, as we get into seasonal rates and the mixed naturally changes, so that’s why we need to continue to monitor it. So typically it’s $30 million, but it really depends on where it’s occurring.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: So $30 million is kind of, if it was uniform across the board?
Ben Fowke: That’s what we generally have used as our back of the envelope calculation, but we are finding that you really have to drill down on it to break it out, to get a good answer.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And can we expect trend towards a forward test year in Colorado kind of being the standard?
Ben Fowke: Well, I think that’s always going be a commission decision and this settlement wasn’t specific about it. I think it certainly has elements that would suggest that it’s something that is gaining acceptance.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And then, Abala touched on with the ITC, but is there any pickup that you could see in the stimulus bill around bonus depreciation or other opportunities?
Ben Fowke: Yes, I think there’s definitely bonus depreciation. As I mentioned, we are looking at the ITC, and there’s plenty of grant monies available for some projects and we like I’m sure every other utility in the nation, is looking at those opportunities.  We’ll make sure, though that we spend that money wisely, because most of those grants are matching, so you really need to make sure that it’s something that is going to be of value. So we’re scrubbing that and expect us to file applications like I’m sure everyone else will, and try to get some of that money for our customers.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc: Thank you.
Ben Fowke:  Thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dudak Research Group; please go ahead.
Ben Fowke: Hey, Danielle.
Daniele Seitz - Dudak Research Group: Hi. I just was wondering, what is going to be your AFC numbers assuming that you are not going to replace it with rate increases in total in Colorado?
Ben Fowke: What our AFUDC numbers are going to be?
Daniele Seitz - Dudak Research Group: Yes. 
Ben Fowke: Well, they are very close to what the CWIP recovery was. So we’ll continue to recognize AFUDC until Comanche 3 goes into service in the second half of this year and then as you know we’ll have a 2010 rate case that we’ll be filing in the next couple of weeks; that will pick up Comanche 3 with AFUDC, and we hope to get a decision there before the start of 2010. Anybody else want to add anything?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Yes, Danielle, I think if you look at last year’s trend for AFUDC I think it’s going to be relatively close to that for the year.
Daniele Seitz - Dudak Research Group: Okay. Similar. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ishar Khan with INCO; please go ahead.
Ishar Khan – INCO: Hi, how are you doing Ben?
Ben Fowke: Good. 
Ishar Khan - INCO: You just mentioned that SPS is going to be about 8% ROE for 2009. Will you be able to maintain that going forward and I guess what is the plan to get it to the required number as you go forward?
Ben Fowke: Well yes, I’m confident we’ll be an 8%, maybe even a little bit better if things go right, but your question of going forward, that remains to be seen. Where I have some optimism Ashar, as you and I talked about is we really have put these fuel issues behind us; our customers are customers again, not plaintiffs and we are working with them, and I think we have a lot of support from our large customers.  We are getting things like interim rates put in place. We’re looking at transmission opportunities there, and we are working with our customers and whenever you have that situation occurring, you’ve got to be a little more optimistic than where we were just a year ago. So time will tell, but the SPS is certainly improving and we are pleased with the progress.
Ishar Khan - INCO: I saw for the first time, you started providing results by each of the subs. Is that some information which we can get for the historical years?
Ben Fowke: Well as you know, we always file separate Ks and Qs for each of the subs, so it’s always been available. We’re just highlighting it this quarter, because we thought it would be useful to you, sounds like it is, and it’s consistent with increasingly how we’ve taken an optimal approach to our strategy and more importantly the execution of that strategy. 
Ishar Khan - INCO: Okay, and if I could just end up, what type of ROEs are you expecting at the other subs in 2009.
Ben Fowke: Overall, we’ll probably be in that 9% to 10% range.
Ishar Khan – INCO: So at PSCo and SPS both, between 9% and 10%. 
Ben Fowke: Yes, I mean just general. If you have SPS in the 8%s, he other ones will do in the 9% to 10%.
Ishar Khan - INCO: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of [Sara Ingram] with Wachovia; please go ahead.
Sara Ingram – Wachovia: Hey, good morning. 
Ben Fowke: High, Sara. 
Sara Ingram – Wachovia: Looking at the OES’ recommendation for the 10 year life extension of Prairie Island, you mentioned that it wouldn’t necessarily have an earnings impact be maybe a cash flow impact, but just from a regulatory standpoint, if you don’t get that rate stabilization plan, what kind of impact would you say that might have going forward? 
Ben Fowke: Well, the rate stabilization plan was to help us have recovery and potentially avoid the need for filing rate cases as we started to operate our nuclear plants, and so we’ll have to work through that and obviously we always had the option of filing rate cases in Minnesota, and as you know that are interim and forward test year based, but that was the goal of that. So we’ll just have to reassess it. Scott, do you want to add anything?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think if the current proposals remain, we would just look to how rate case is timed. They are a very large investment and they’ll be easy to time in terms of trying to seek the recovery and that’s the way we manage it.
Sara Ingram – Wachovia: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, and management, I show we have no further questions at this time.
Ben Fowke: Okay great. Well, thanks for participating in our first quarter earnings call and I look forward to seeing many of you in person next week at AGA. In the meantime, if you have any follow-up questions, call Paul Johnson or the rest of the IR team and hopefully they’ll answer your questions. Thank you.

Operator:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday January 29, 2009. Now I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson : Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's year end 2008 earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson. With me is Ben Fowke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy, and several others who can help answer your questions. Today we plan to cover our 2008 results and accomplishments. Please note that there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our website. Let me remind you that some of the comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause differences from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today’s discussion will focus on ongoing results which we believe represents the fundamental earnings power of Xcel Energy. Please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings. Before I turn the call over to Ben, I will cover our overall financial results and how we calculate ongoing earnings. 2008 GAAP earnings were $646 million or $1.46 per share, compared with $577 million or $1.35 per share in 2007. As you may recall in 2007 we reached a settlement resolving our dispute with the IRS regarding our COLI program. As a result, our 2007 GAAP earnings include an $0.08 per share charge for the resolution of this dispute. Our 2008 GAAP earnings include a $0.01 benefit from the discontinued COLI program. This morning's discussion will focus on ongoing earnings, which exclude the impact of COLI on our results. Ongoing earnings for 2008 were $1.45 per share compared with the $1.43 per share last year. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III : Thanks Paul and welcome everyone. As Paul just mentioned our 2008 ongoing earnings were $1.45 per share. This is at the low end of our guidance range and compares with earnings of $1.43 per share in 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share higher AFUDC earnings, which increased earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher electric margins, which increased earnings by $0.03 per share and lower O&M expense, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. These positive factors were offset by higher financing cost, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share. Higher depreciation, which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.
 :
 : Conservation in non-fuel riders contributed $28 million and the MERP rider added $23 million. These drivers were partially offset by a couple of key items, most notably cool weather during this summer reduced electric margin by $49 million. In addition, purchase capacity cost reduced electric margin by $30 million. We are also experiencing slower sales growth in 2008. On a weather-adjusted basis, retail sales grew by about 1.7%. However, weather-adjusted residential sales were flat for the year. As many of you know, residential sales provide higher margin than the C&I class.  The combination of lower sales growth and the change in sales mix resulted in only $22 million or about $0.03 per share of electric margin for the year. Normally, we would have expected sales growth to contribute $0.08 to $0.10 of earnings per share. So this represents an opportunity cost of $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the year and was an important factor in pushing earnings to the low end of our guidance range. The 2009 earnings guidance assumption assumes relatively flat sales growth. This is a key assumption and we will need to monitor sales trends closely throughout the year. For more information, please refer to the electric margin table in our earnings release. Higher natural gas margins, which increased $46 million or $0.06 per share also had a positive impact. The most significant drivers for rate increases in Colorado and Wisconsin, which increased margin by $24 million, in addition, colder winter temperatures increased gas margins by $10 million compared with 2007. Sales growth and other miscellaneous items increased natural gas margins by a total of $12 million.  Although, I have discussed the whether impacts on both electric and gas margins, it might be helpful to talk about the overall impact on our results. In 2008, actual temperatures were fairly close to normal. However, in 2007, we did experience favorable temperatures, which increased earnings by about $0.06 per share compared to normal. As a result, we have an unfavorable variance of $0.06 per share between the two years. Now turning to operating expenses, our 2008 O&M expenses were down $11 million compared with 2007. You might remember at the beginning of 2008, we were projecting an O&M increase of 2 to 3%. However, as the year unfolded and it was evident that sales growth would not meet our expectations. We began making necessary adjustments to our O&M budgets. The most notable move was the decision to eliminate our annual incentive compensation, which reduced 2008 O&M expense by $50 million, that reduction was partially offset by increases in other employee benefits. In total, employee benefits decreased $39 million for the year. Offsetting these reductions were higher labor costs, plant generation costs, and bad debt expense.  In 2009, we expect our O&M expenses to increase more than usual for a number of reasons. We expect benefit costs will rise because we have reestablished our annual incentive compensation, in addition to increased medical and pension expense. We are also expecting increases in nuclear cost. This is largely driven by the Commission approved change in accounting, resulting in a deferral and amortization of nuclear outage cost and increased staffing due to NRC requirements.  Moving on, depreciation and amortization expense increased $23 million or approximately 2.8% reflecting growth in our capital investment program. Conservation and demand side management expenses increase $16 million or 15.7% as the programs expanded, which was consistent with public policy in our major jurisdictions. These costs are generally recovered dollar-for-dollar through various riders and rate cases.
 : During 2008, we successfully navigated a challenging financing environment and raised $2.3 billion through a variety of transactions. This funding will enable us to continue to execute our building the core strategy, despite continued challenges in the capital markets. 
 : As a result of the market melt down many companies are grappling with the issue of pension funding. Early in 2008, we were in great shape compared with most of our peers, because our qualified pension plans were 120% funded on a PBO basis. However, with market deterioration, and our consolidated pension plans were funded at 84% at the end of 2008. Our current plan is to invest within a range of $70 to $130 million in our pension plans in 2009. All these estimates are subject to change, pension contributions in 2010 could be in the range of $150 to $250 million, based on conservative assumptions. We anticipate that contributions in 2011 and beyond will decline from these levels. Ultimately, funding will depend on realized asset performance, due discount rates, actuarial assumptions, IRS and legislative initiatives.
 : This increase will be offset by a refund rather from declining fuel cost so, customer bills will not increase in 2009. In our North Dakota electric rate case, the Commission approved a settlement agreement that calls for a $12.8 million rate increase, based on an authorized ROE of 10.75%. In our Texas case, we’ve been actively negotiating with various parties since November and we are hopeful and have a settlement in the near future that will allow us to improve the regulatory returns at SPS.
 : Finally in New Mexico, we filed a case to increase electric rates by about $25 million or 5%. We are also seeking interim rates for a portion of the overall request related to a capacity contract. Our regulatory strategy has always been to file straightforward no-frills cases. This is especially true given the current economic downturn. We focus our request on the value we provide to customers. As always, our guidance range for 2009 assumes we will receive reasonable regulatory outcomes from our pending filings. A list of accomplishments also includes several noteworthy capital projects. As we mentioned in the past, one of our goals is to own more renewable energy assets. In 2008 we made significant progress on this front by completing our Grand Meadow Wind farms, a 100 megawatt facility in Minnesota. Grand Meadow which began operating in December was completed on time and on budget. In addition, we signed contracts for two additional wind generation projects in Minnesota and North Dakota, which will add 351 megawatt to our system by the end of 2011. We estimate the cost of these projects at about $900 million, which is included in our capital forecast. Regulatory approval is pending and once construction is underway, these projects will qualify for rider recovery in Minnesota. You may remember that the original RFP was for 500 to 700 megawatts of incremental wind generation. However, we decided to scale back the projects in light of the current economic climate. Nevertheless, we remain on track to meet the renewable portfolio standards in our jurisdictions and continue to expect to have more than 7000 megawatts of renewable generation online by 2020.  We are also very pleased with the progress we made in 2008 on our major construction projects. Those include the Metro Emission Reduction Project in Minnesota, also known as MARP, as well as our Comanche 3 and Fort St. Vrain projects in Colorado. In 2009, we expect to complete the MARP effort with the repowering at our Riverside plant. In Colorado, Comanche 3 and Fort St. Vrain are also scheduled to come online in 2009. With these projects complete, we will have added about 1100 megawatts of capacity to our system at very competitive cost for our customers. We expect them to be finished on time and very close to their original budget.  Finally, we recognize that a competitive dividend yield is an important component of the value proposition we offer our investors, especially in a turbulent market. In May we increased our dividend by $0.03 per share or little over 3%. This is consistent with our long-term objective of annual increases in the 2% to 4% range, which we don’t plan to change.  To wrap things up it’s clear from our 2008 results that we weren’t immune to the current macroeconomic environment. We believe those conditions will affect our near-term sales growth, which is reflected in our 2009 earnings guidance. As a result, the mid-point of our earnings guidance range of a $1.45 to a $1.55, offers modest growth relative to our long-term objective of 5 to 7% When things improve we will be in good position to resume our long-term earnings growth trajectory.  Given our strong credit quality, and relatively modest near-term financing needs, we are well positioned to continue to execute our overall growth strategy in 2009 and beyond. But with that, lets open it up for questions.

). :
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Thanks good – good morning.
Paul A. Johnson : Hi Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Yeah, you guys just got the interim rates in Minnesota, and that was the earlier in the year than I would have expected, so that’s positive. So when I look at the guidance range that you have outlined for us, I know that there is a baseline assumption vis-à-vis sales expectations in terms of kilowatt hour sales growth or lack here off. Could you tell us what if your, the baseline you’ve given us in the sort of summary of drivers represent to the mid-point and what the high and the low, all things equal, might represent in terms of sensitivities and then in the context that what you are actually seeing vis-à-vis demand? I know it’s early in a year.
Paul A. Johnson : Yeah, Greg. I mean, good question. We typically put our assumptions and we add it all up and take the expected values that would put us about in the middle of the range. A penny either way. That’s where we typically try to set guidance and this year has been no exception. And I mean I think the key things for us to track were obviously the regulatory outcomes, that’s a big part of our success next year, but we need to monitor sales trends. We saw, as you know flat sales full year for 2008. The fourth quarter, we actually saw some improvement on the residential side here in Minnesota and so a little bit of weakness in PSCO. So, we continue to really look at this closely. We think our assumptions are right. We’re prepared to react if it’s not. Love to see sales improve, but at this point I think assuming flat sales is probably the right way to go.
Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:   Thank you sir. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski :  Thank you. I’m going to go back to the assumptions for 2009 guidance and then I have a question about pensions, when you look at your 2008 electric sales growth for retail they are actually up 1.7% to either flat sales only for residential. And then gas was up on an weather normalized basis, well, almost 2%, 1.9%, which is kind of surprising at least for me. If you assume flat year-over-year electric sales and gas sales you simply assume that the pattern from ’09, for ’08 will be retained, which would be surprising for me given the weakness in industrials and commercials and that’s what drove your growth in electric demand in 2008. So how could you reconcile these numbers? And secondly, if you could talk me through your pension accounting, I understand the funding requirement for ’09 and ’10 but if you could tell me what the earnings impact is going to be and why I was seeing higher impacts for 2010 from the funding perspective then for ’09 and what kind of assumption do you have for returns for the pension plans in ’09.
 Macquarie Capital.:  Thank you. I’m going to go back to the assumptions for 2009 guidance and then I have a question about pensions, when you look at your 2008 electric sales growth for retail they are actually up 1.7% to either flat sales only for residential. And then gas was up on an weather normalized basis, well, almost 2%, 1.9%, which is kind of surprising at least for me.

So how could you reconcile these numbers? And secondly, if you could talk me through your pension accounting, I understand the funding requirement for ’09 and ’10 but if you could tell me what the earnings impact is going to be and why I was seeing higher impacts for 2010 from the funding perspective then for ’09 and what kind of assumption do you have for returns for the pension plans in ’09.
Paul A. Johnson : All right. Iif I forget one the questions, remind me. I think you wanted to talk about funding, the pension assumption, the pension expense, and why basically don’t see more of a reduction in the C&I class next year?
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: That’s correct. I mean it’s surprisingly strong. I mean, the results for the annualized results for ’08.
Paul A. Johnson : Yeah 
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital:  On a whether normalized basis seems very strong compared to..
Paul A. Johnson : Yeah let me shed some light on that for you. I mean, if you break it up by jurisdiction by far the biggest positive increase in C&I was at SPS, which it was largely driven by the energy service field and I would say also that that is largely driven by the large C&I customers which is I reported to you before. We typically don’t have the same margin of profitability, particularly with large C&I. Its not as energy megawatt sensitive as it is more capacity type charges. So while you see the sales pick up, we didn’t see a lot of margin for it, which is why the sales mix didn’t come in as it usually does. So if you look at our other jurisdictions, NSP Min for full year just under 1%, PSCO was about 1.8%. So, I mean, we looked at those trends and assess the economies that we are operating in which while they have been impacted by, what’s happening in the general economy, they have faired a little bit better than the actual average. And so we remain comfortable with that.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: How about gas, how about gas?
Paul A. Johnson : You know gas, yeah, you asked that question and gas we really saw, a pick up at PSCO, not so much NSP Min and as you probably know PSCO is the by far the largest gas operation that we have. I don’t have a really good answer why it pick up so much, it surprised us too, other than I would say, gas prices did modulate particularly in the Rockies this year and perhaps our customers were little less price sensitive. Does that answer your sales questions?
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital: Yeah, that’s okay. Lets move on to pension plans.
Paul A. Johnson : Yeah, lets move on to pension. Lets start with the funding assumptions. I said in my prepared remarks that I think we are using conservative assumption let’s shed some light on that. I mean, we are making, our actuarial assumptions long-term or that the assets perform at 8.75% and we have a discount rate on the liabilities side of 6.75% what we did for our funding calculation is assume that this year we have basically flat assets performance. So I think that’s hopefully a big conservative. We also if you get into the details of pension, not so much accounting but the PPA rules, there are elections you can make to either keep assets at market or smooth them. Currently, we are at market we like that, we're contemplating and will probably make the election to smooth assets, that will give us quite a lot of relief and with all things equal, pushes on the low-end of that $150 to $250 range that I mentioned for 2010. Think I misspoke before the asset assumption is 8.5%, not 8.75% by the way, but we brought it down from where it was in ’07. So, no asset return basically in 2009. And a range that assumes the difference between the assets smoothing election or not for 2010. And, I think that should put us I hope in a conservative light for 2010. Post 2010 the funding requirements will decline. So that’s the funding side. I think you had a question about expense too.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital.:
 :
That’s true. On the expense side.:
Paul A. Johnson :  Okay on the expense side, we did see an increase in pension expense this year, in the $12 to $14 million range. Last year we actually had a negative pension expense. This year I think it’s a $12 million, is that right Teresa? Well, so, that would give about a $14 million swing. We will see that kind of expense increase over the next couple of years about at that same range as you know pension accounting is very much has a smoothing impact. So pension expense will tick up a little bit over the next three years it’s not going to it will be gradual and in this kind of ranges that I’ve described to you.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital:  And it is accounted for in your O&M projections, right? So, you will be basically able to offset any pension increase, pension cost increase by reductions in O&M expenses and other O&Million?
Paul A. Johnson : Yeah well, Let me answer the question, between pension and medical we are assuming a $25 million increase in 2009 over 2008. Part of that is the pension expenses that I mentioned, part of it’s medical, part of it’s retiree medical for the other piece.
Angie Storozynski – Macquarie Capital:  This is for 2010?
Unidentified Company Representative:  In 2010, you’d probably see that I can’t speak to the medical side at this point. I don’t have it in front of me, but on the pension side, you’d probably see that increased about $12 million all for that. And that clearly is baked into our guidance.
Angie Storozynski -Macquarie Capital:  Okay. Thank you.
Paul A. Johnson : Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you ma’am. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Siegel with Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead 
Mark Siegel - Canaccord Adams: Yeah, hi good morning. I was wondering if you could just provide a brief update on your smart grid programs where that the status of those might be in your anticipated plans in the future?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: 
The project is well underway. As you know that’s a pilot program in Boulder where we are taking all Boulder and really we call it smart grid city where we are not only putting in two-way metering, but monitoring devices at the customer’s election behind the meter. So they can monitor energy consumption or they can do it remotely. And then what we are also doing is even before you get to the meter, putting in software and basically digitizing an analog system, so that we get a better read of transformers and can be more proactive in anticipating failures. I think we are little more than halfway through, probably little more than that, the rollout and what our plan is to, finish the project, assess the various technologies that we are researching, and come up with conclusions on what makes sense to perhaps rollout more deeply within our jurisdictions. Obviously, share that with our Commissions and the learnings and then take it forward from there.:
Mark Siegel - Canaccord Adams: Okay, any sense on the timing if you do decide to move forward on any of those initiatives what timeframe you might be looking at?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: No I mean, the first step is to get the results and the second step is to share it with our Commissions. And then we’ll take it from there.
Mark Siegel - Canaccord Adams: Okay, thanks very much.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Thanks. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  Hey Dan. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Hi good morning. First of all, I was wondering, have you made any revisions to your CapEx budget that you presented at EEI given the economic changes since then?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III:  Well, I think you might have been at the Analyst Day. We haven't changed our CapEx forecast since then. That CapEx forecast reflected a reduction and how much wind ownership we were going to pursue as I mentioned. Originally we thought we’d get ahead of the RPS standards. Now we are pretty much staying on track with those RPS standards.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. You mentioned in the release your debt financing plans $400 million of FMBs for both NSP-Minnesota.
Paul A. Johnson: Dan, can you speak up a little bit?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Yeah in your press release you mentioned your financing plans of $400 million for both NSP-Minnesota and Public Service Colorado. I was wondering do you have any sense of the timing of those?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: George, when are we going to do that? Second and third quarter Dan and, that represents a I think that’s about $350 million of incremental debt, it’s some of which is to retire maturing debt.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board:  Okay and then I want to get a little more feel for your for C&I sales. They seem a little bit higher than what we are seeing in other parts of the country. Just, can you give me like a sense of what the distribution is industrial-wise that would make maybe your sales look a little better than the national average or are you hearing anything about any layoffs or plant closures or whatever in any of you service territories that might impact that?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: You listen, our territories I think are fairing better than the national average, but they are not immune. I mean, we just heard that Target for example was having layoffs here just yesterday. I mean, so yeah there are layoffs that are happening. And again as I said before I think the results of our C&I sales results are little bit skewed by what happened at SPS where for full year the C&I class grew by 6.7%. Again, that’s largely with big C&I customers, which we really don’t make much of a margin on the energy sales, the margins typically made on the demand charge.
Paul A. Johnson: Dan, the other thing I might add is as, we look in 2009 we expect to see in our numbers as we expect to see a quite a bit softness in small C&I class, which obviously the retail is going to be affected there. So, that is reflected, so while did have strong C&I sales in 2008 we do expect some moderation of that as we move forward into 2009.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Runay with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Grayson –Robert W. Baird: Good morning it’s Michael Grayson that is. 
Unidentified Company Representative : Hi.
Michael Grayson –Robert W. Baird: In relation to the rate cases for Minnesota and in Colorado, just wondering what your assumptions within those rate filings were relative to some of the key items that you talked about like for lower weather-adjusted sales growth than the higher pension expenses in terms of competition and alike?
Paul A. Johnson: Well, basically, all of those assumptions are embedded in those rate cases.
Michael Grayson –Robert W. Baird: Okay, so there has been no, let’s say deterioration in your outlook since then that would cause those rate cases not to fully reflect your current expectations? 
Paul A. Johnson: There has been a bit of deterioration for example in the pension expense and those sorts of things and a couple of things I’d say about that. We will have an opportunity to introduce any changes positive and negative in rebuttal. So we can do that, and I would also point out that just like we did it last year in 2008, we certainly have contingency plans to adapt to the economy, to adapt to whatever comes our way. One of the things we did at the very beginning of this year is decided that we would give no raises to the executive for senior managers of the company and that we would defer merit raises to later this year. So, I think we are certainly reacting to what’s happening in the economy, since we filed the rate case. So, I don’t know if I got to answered your question but… 
Michael Grayson –Robert W. Baird: Yeah that helps, thank you.
Operator: Thank you sir. And our next question is from the line of Danielle Sykes with Sykes Research. Please go ahead 
Unidentified Company Representative : Hi, Danielle how are you.
Danielle Sykes - Sykes Research : My questions have been answered. Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative :  Good.
Operator: Thanks ma’am. And our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. 
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Hi Paul.
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey Ben, how are you?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Good. 
Paul Ridzon – KeyBanc Capital Markets: What you are seeing in Washington and what your expectations about the timing of Carbon legislation?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Climate legislation?
Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets: Carbon, climate same things yes?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Yeah well, obviously it's front and center and we are seeing some of that addressed with some of the energy policies addressed through this stimulus bill that was passed by the House yesterday and we certainly like seeing the PDCs extended. As for as climate goes, that’s hard to say when we’ll get Climate legislation. I think the over under is beyond ’09. Although we believe that certainly its realistic to think we might see something on a national RPS standard in 2009. So that’s kind of how I would handicap it Paul.
Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets: If you built and are continuing to build a pretty decent footprint from the renewable standard and given the way to world is changing in the direction its going into, I mean and are you getting approached by any companies who might marry that type of a footprint just a diversified what might be a large carbon concentration?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: Well, I mean as you know, we don’t really comment on M&A. And I think that’s what you are referring to. I think what we are seeing is people wanting to partner with us to build renewable plants and look at other technologies and what the renewable leadership position we have has helped us help shape the rules. Not only in the state but increasingly, I think we are getting recognized at the Federal level. So, I guess people envy that, but we are in a unique position Paul, that the renewable generation that we have right in our backyard is reasonably economical. We have solar resources in the South and people should envy us. I think we are in pretty good shape to address what’s coming. 
Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets:  Okay, that's fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you sir. And I have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III : Thanks everyone for participating today. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to give Paul Johnson and rest of the IR team a call. Thank you

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded Thursday October 23rd of 2008. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul John, Managing Director Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director, Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy's Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Paul Johnson. With me today is Ben Foulke, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy and several others who can help answer your questions. Today we plan to cover our third quarter results, provide a business update and discuss our 2008 guidance. Please note there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of the comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today's discussion will focus on ongoing results, which we believe represent the fundamental earnings power of Xcel Energy. Please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings. Before I turn the call over to Ben, I will cover our overall financial results and how we calculate our ongoing earnings. Third quarter 2008 GAAP earnings were $223 million or $0.51 per share, compared to $255 million or $0.59 per share in 2007. In 2007, we reached a settlement resolving our dispute with the IRS regarding our COLI program. Our 2008 third quarter earnings do not include any material impact from the discontinued COLI program. However, our 2007 third quarter GAAP earnings include a gain of $0.01 per share, associated with the resolution of this dispute. This morning's discussion will focus on ongoing earnings, which exclude the impact of COLI on our results. Ongoing earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $0.51 per share versus $0.58 per share last year. With that, I will turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Paul and welcome everyone. Paul just mentioned our ongoing earnings were $0.51 per share for third quarter 2008, compared to $0.58 per share a year ago. As we noted in the prospective supplement for our equity issuance in early September, we expected earnings would decline for the quarter. There were a couple of items that benefited 2007 earnings that were not expected to recur in the third quarter of 2008. Most notably third quarter 2007 earnings were increased by about $0.08 per share, from a depreciation adjustment and warmer than normal temperatures. However, third quarter 2008 results were also negatively impacted by an erosion in residential sales, particularly at NSP-Minnesota. As a result, we are becoming more concerned about the overall economy and the potential impact of the financial crisis on our customers' behavior. I will discuss this impact in greater detail in a few moments. But let me start with the quarterly results. Third quarter 2008 ongoing earnings decrease by $0.07 compared to last year, largely due to lower electric margin, largely driven by an unfavorable weather comparison, and lower than expected sales growth, which decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, and higher depreciation expense which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Starting with the top of the income statement; electric margin decreased by about $28 million for the quarter, due to a combination of factors; although the most significant driver was an unfavorable weather comparison. On a positive side, an electric rate increase was constant, an interim rate increase in North Dakota and the rate rider [ph] combined to increase electric margin by $20 million this quarter. However, these increases were offset by a combination of items. An unfavorable weather comparison between the quarters reduced electric margin by $32 million or roughly $0.05 per share. We also experienced slower sales growth in the quarter. On a weather-adjusted basis, retail sales grew by only 1%. In addition, weather-adjusted residential sales actually declined 2.2% for the quarter, and within the C&I customer class we saw decline in small C&I sales offset by growths in our larger C&I class. And this is a trend we first discussed last quarter, and it appears to have continued and accelerated this quarter. As many of you know, residential sales provide a higher margin than the C&I class. Combination of lower sales growth and a change in sales mix resulted in no growth in electric margin for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis our total weather adjusted retail sales grew 1.8%. However, our residential sales growth was flat. This trend was not contemplated in our annual guidance. Generally electric sales growth of 2% across all customer classes will provide incremental earnings of about $0.06 per share on a year-to-date basis. However, the year-to-date combination of weather adjusted sales growth and customer mix have only increased earnings by about $0.02 per share. This represents an opportunity cost of $0.04 per share and has created an unexpected earnings drag. We have updated our sales forecast and unfortunately we expect this trend to continue into next year. Finally electric margin declined by $17 million due to the deferral of revenue associated with nuclear outage expenses. In the third quarter the Minnesota PUC approved our nuclear outage amortization request with certain modifications. The impact of the ruling was, for about half what we anticipated in our original guidance. The ruling reduced O&M expenses but was partially offset by revenue deferrals. For more information on the other items that had an impact on electric margin for the quarter please refer to our table in our earnings release. Moving on to O&M expenses third quarter O&M was essentially flat for the quarter. Increases in labor costs, consulting and generation costs; were offset by lower benefit costs, a change in our accounting for nuclear outage costs and various management initiatives. In light of the lower sales growth we have taken and will continue to take management actions to reduce O&M expenses. This includes lowering the accrual for incentive compensation. While we are taking steps reduce costs we will not sacrifice customer service or reliability. As a result of these actions we now project O&M expenses will be relatively flat for the full year. Next, third quarter depreciation and amortization expense increased $23 million or about 12%. As you recall, during the third quarter last year the Minnesota commission approved NSP-Minnesota's remaining life depreciation filing for the Monticello nuclear plant effective January 2007. This ruling reduced our third quarter 2007 depreciation expense by $31 million. This increase was partially offset by an updated depreciation study approved this year. That explains the significant quarterly deviation. Next, I want to touch on a couple of regulatory items. We have several pending rate cases that we have included an updated in our earnings release. We are also planning on filing cases in Colorado and Minnesota. In Colorado we are planning to file an electric rate case based on a forward test year. The timing of this case is subject to several factors. In particular we are looking at several different options for test years related to the cost recovery of Comanche 3, which is expected to come on-line in the second half 2009. We are also looking at filing an electric rate case in Minnesota. In Minnesota interim rates would go into effect 60 days after the rate filing. I know you have lots of questions about the Minnesota and Colorado rate cases. However, there's still a lot of moving pieces and I'm not in a position to provide too much color, since we're still in the process of determining the timing, size and scope of the cases. We anticipate having more clarity on the details in the coming weeks and we will provide with you an updated at either the EEI meeting or at our analyst meeting in December. I would like to spend a few minutes discussing how we've been successfully managing through the credit and liquidity crisis. We have always viewed conservative financial management as a strength. For the last several years I have discussed the importance of strong credit ratings, a solid balance sheet and good liquidity. While this philosophy hasn't always been in vogue, times have certainly changed. Over the last year we have been proactive, taking steps to strengthen our balance sheet and improve liquidity. For example, several years ago we entered into a multi-company five-year credit facility and then subsequently extended to 10-years. As a result our credit facilities don't mature until the end of 2011 Our combined credit facilities provide just under $2.2 billion of liquidity and that is after adjusting for the Lehman bankruptcy. In 2007 we completed a debt exchange for a $600 million bond at the holding company. This allowed us to reduce the amount maturing in 2010 and to extend a portion of the debt until 2017./ Earlier this year we issued a retail hybrid security at the holding company, prior to the closing of the hybrid market. We prefunded debt maturities and paid down short-term debt at NSP Minnesota, PSCo and NSP-Wisconsin, by issuing first mortgage bonds earlier in the year when rates were attractive. Finally we further strengthened our balance sheet by issuing equity in September before the markets collapsed. All of these actions improved our liquidity and reduced risk. At the end of this week we had a total liquidity of about $1.9 billion. In addition we have expanded our earnings release to provide additional information on our liquidity position. While we've taken proactive actions and have strong liquidity, the economy is having an impact on our results and probably other utilities. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced a slow down in electric sales growth during the quarter, particularly in the residential customer class. We currently are projecting that this trend will continue into the fourth quarter and 2009. In addition to the impact on sales growth we are closely monitoring other economic impact, including bad debt expense and interest rates for the potential impact on 2009 After we close the books on our third quarter results, we spent a great deal of effort on our forecast to reflect the changing economic conditions and trends. As a result, we now expect to be at that time low end of 2008 earnings guidance range of $1.45 to $1.50 per share. In past years, we've released our earnings guidance for the next year in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release. However, this year we plan to issue our 2009 earnings guidance at either BEI or our analyst meeting in December. This will allow us additional time to update our forecast for the potential rate cases and the latest economic trends. While we're not issuing guidance, I would like to provide some qualitative comments. We recognize that we are in uncharted waters, and expect 2009 to be a challenging year. We expect that the economic situation will continue to be bearish and that credit market will remain tight. So how will this affect Xcel Energy? While we don't view this as a long-term trend, we are currently projecting weather adjusted sales growth to be flat in 2009. We expect O&M costs will continue to rise. While there's been some recent moderation, commodity costs are still higher than historic levels; our rate-based growth plan increases the scope of our utility operations and our O&M expenses, and finally we expect bad debt expense will continue to be an area of concern. Our rate based growth strategy will also increase depreciation expense. Finally credit markets will remain tight and interest costs will be higher than historic levels. While some of these cost increases will be covered by write ups and forward-looking rate cases with interim rates, we aren't filing cases in all jurisdictions and there will be some regulatory lag. As a result, even with rate filings, we expect that our 2009 earnings will be only modestly higher than 2008 results. While we're still confident in our long-term strategy and growth objectives, we do anticipate next year's earnings growth will be below our historic rate as the nation adjusts to the new economic realities. Next let me spend a few minutes talking about our capital expenditures. As many of you know, we have a wide range of attractive investment opportunities. As we developed our plans, our projected capital forecast was above what we had previously shared with you. However, in the light of rising market volatility and the tightening of credit markets, we have decided to revisit these culinary [ph] plans. We continue to evaluate each of our project to determine an optimal level of spend, that enables our company to achieve our renewable growth goals, but also allows for flexibility in the current market conditions. We anticipate that once this evaluation is complete, our projected capital expenditure forecast will be consistent with what we've shared with you previously. In the coming weeks, we plan to finalize the details associated with our earnings guidance, capital expenditure forecast, and our rate plans. We plan to discuss this with you in detail at either BEI or at our analyst day in New York on December 3rd. Before turning the call over to you for questions, I would like to comment on just a few more items. In closing, the market uncertainty we've all witnessed is unprecedented. We believe we have successfully navigated this volatility and lowered our overall risk profile. To date we've raised over $2 billion with a combination of debt, hybrid, and equity issuances. Given these successful financings, we are well positioned to execute our growth plan into 2009. Strategy is working, pursuing clean energy allows Xcel Energy to meet increasing demand and reduce carbon with smaller less time-sensitive projects. This provides with us additional flexibility. Adding smaller renewable assets to the fleet will allow the company to push up the time line for a new base load investment for many years. Considering the projected costs with new base load plants and where credit markets are today, we are fortunate to have the flexibility. So in summary, while the economy poses challenges for us, I believe we are uniquely positioned and prepared to meet our strategic plans, environmental goals and long-term objectives. So with that operator, we'll take questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you Sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Danielle Sykes [ph] with Sykes Research. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Danielle, how are you?
Danielle Sykes - Sykes Research: Good morning. Hi, good. I just was wondering if you… since you have done so much advanced financing, do you still need plan on issuing equity next year or is it still not really firm yet?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No Danielle I think the steps we took in September with equity addressed our equity needs for the foreseeable future.
Danielle Sykes - Sykes Research: Great. And also you mentioned bad debt expenses. Do you have any comparison or any data that you can share at this time?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bad debt for the quarter was just slightly above third quarter 2007, and we are forecasting that bad debt will come in about at the same level of… in 2008 as it did in 2007 and about what it did in 2006 That is though an expense higher than what we originally anticipated for the year Danielle. I think I had mentioned in prior calls, we have really improved a lot of processes on our bad debt collection, and we had hoped that we could bring bad debt expense down but given the economic conditions we're in that's not likely now. And I do believe that we need to really monitor this trend in the coming quarter and certainly into 2009.
Danielle Sykes - Sykes Research: Thanks
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with SAC Capital. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Ashar.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Ben, if I'm right you need $0.36 or a $0.06 improvement in the fourth quarter to achieve the lower end of the guidance. Could you tell us what are the positive factors versus last year, which will allow to you reach the low end of the guidance?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A lot of it will come in O&M Ashar. I mean if the… Last year I believe O&M probably was running at a trend line higher than what you saw the full year. This year we expect it will be the opposite. So that will do a lot for us. The $0.02 benefit we only got half of what we were looking for from the nuclear fueling outage. You'll see that impact in the O&M number. So by and large it will be in O&M.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. And then Ben you referred to in your release that you might need higher equity contributions in the pension and decommissioning funds. Could you talk about that how much higher contributions would be required and I guess you have the cash flows for those?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well let me just put it in perspective. I mean, we entered the year with a very well funded pension plan, one I think, one of the better funded plans in the industry and in the nation. So we start from a good place. But everybody knows what's happened in the market year to date. So, as a result the funded status has fallen. And we talked about where the asset levels are in the earnings release. Keep in mind Ashar that some of that will be offset by a higher discount rate. The bottom line is we've been funding about $35 million a year in our pension plans. We don't have the exact numbers now. We'll have to obviously analyze that as the year progresses. But I suspect that funding levels will increase from that $35 million a year level.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. And if I can just end up with…. Ben, so as I know next year you are saying zero growth, you are saying bad debt, O&M are somewhat offset by the increase from the interim rate hike. So as we go out beyond that I guess… and you kind of went away from your long-term growth rate. How should we look beyond that? Is that Colorado rate case and the growth coming back… gets you back towards growth later on or should we just take a lower stab at the earnings growth rate going from 2009 onward?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Are you talking about our long-term…
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Yes.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: ..,earnings growth objective of 5 to 7? Ashar, the way I see it is, there's no reason to think that, that long-term growth rate isn't still valid. That said, I think it's very difficult to have that sort of long-term growth rate in this economic… with this economic condition. So assuming we start to see the economy improve, then we're right back on track in what we can see in our long-term growth rate.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. And if I can end up with… was there a reduction in retail sales consistent among all the companies like Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota or was it more hurt [ph] in one area versus the other?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It definitely… we saw the impact much more here in NSP-Minnesota. A little less so in Colorado and sales were stronger at SPS. So it depends on the jurisdiction. And within the retail sales as I mentioned on the call, the real surprising thing for us was the decline in residential sales which has a higher margin associated with it.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ashar I think that's consistent when you look at the economic…the macro economic trends for each one of those states that I referred to.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay. Thank you sir.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital Securities: Thank you. I am just going ask the same questioning again about at the elasticity of residential demand. Do you think it's a trend that is sustainable? Should we consider it… conservation efforts that we should see going forward or is it just an adjustment of demand trends to basically prices of electricity and with natural gas, and maybe coal prices coming down we should expect that this is going to disappear?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think that's a great question. I don't know if I after definitive answer for you. I think if you look at what happened in the last month, last couple months and the acceleration of residential sales growth or the lack of acceleration, I should say. Then you have to attribute that I think to probably the more macro economic conditions. But we had seen some I think some general conservation efforts in the second quarter. We started spotting that trend, which I think was probably more consistent with higher commodity prices and more environmental awareness and conservation efforts. And in fact we had been working very hard as part of state policy to implement conservation. So we need to monitor that trend. I think you are going to see sales remain relatively flat in 2009. My suspicion is that when the economy starts to improve, you will you start to see the growth rate inch back up to more like its historic levels.
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates, please go ahead.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Just a brief question on the rate case and the staff [ph] testimony that came out in Texas. There was a depreciation reduction expense that they had expected. Do you know what it was as… how much that related to the difference between what you guys were asking for and what the company was putting forward?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Paul let me turn that over to Scott Wilensky, who runs our regulatory affairs.
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: Thank you. The staff reduction was approximately equal to the same rate change that we had requested in the case. We had requested a rate change that increased revenue requirement by about $11 million and their reduction in essence reversed that.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. And then in terms of when you talk about modest growth over 2009 versus 2008, we're talking what just a couple percent? Is that the sort of thing we should be thinking the about?
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: And that's what we need to work on in the next couple weeks, as we look at how we're filing these rate cases and we continue to assess economic trends. So I'll leave it at that qualitative note at this point Paul.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay. And then the C&I seemed to do okay. Do you expect that to change with the economic conditions or just how should we think about that?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You know we don't… with the exception of SPS, we don't have a huge industrial base. It's more the C than the I. But what we… and so generally it's behaved pretty normally, although as I told you and I mentioned in the call, more sales on the larger C&I class, a little bit less on the smaller C&I class. And again that erodes margin profitability as well as larger C&I class that you tend to make your return on demand revenues and not so much the energy sales. But from a general economic assessment, we're seeing some slowness but not anything like we saw with residential here in Minnesota.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Do you expect that to change or I mean I'm just sort of… in other words it just seems to rely [ph] where there's only residential customers that are holding back and that the rest guys seem to be sort of not impacted.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I expect that it will be jurisdictionally specific. Here in Minnesota, if you broke it down, you would you see the C&I class probably decline from historic levels. Texas things are very robust in the Texas panhandle with oil and gas and agriculture. In Colorado middle of the road you do have oil and gas, you do have mining, but maybe a little bit of weakness. So I think it's really going to mirror the general economic trends of the states.
Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Paul.
Operator: Paul your line is now open.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: I'm sorry I was muted. Just wondering where you are in your various jurisdictions around de-coupling, just kind of give me what you are seeing with conservation. And then I was just wondering if you could clarify the third quarter impact on the nuclear outage deferral and you kind of lost me there.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Alright. Well, why don't we start with the nuclear deferral? We had asked the Commission to change the way we account for refueling expenses. And basically what we were trying to do is have those refueling expenses amortize over the life of the refueling. And that will tend to make for a more smooth outage… refueling outage expense between the years, because Paul we have one-year, two-year kind of outages and it creates a little [inaudible] earnings volatility. Now that change to accounting was approved by the Commission. However, they modified it with the provision that to the extent that the expense after the amortization change is implemented and that expense is less than what was last embedded in the last rate case we filed in Minnesota that, that portion would have to be refunded to our customers and that's exactly what we set up in the third quarter. The deferral of revenues and the margin offset by the reduction in O&M expense associated with the accounting change. Does that help on that question?
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: So now we are expensing the refueling over the life of the refuel cycle.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And if you come in… you do better than forecast your refund.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Not forecast. If we do better… if the expense for 2008 is less than the expense that was embedded in our last rate case in Minnesota, then we have to refund that difference. But keep in mind Paul; we are going to be in a rate case in Minnesota next year, so everything will get trued out.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: And your expenses went below what you expected in this inflationary environment?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: With the amortization, yes.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Okay, thank you. And then on [inaudible]?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What was the first question again? I am sorry.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Just where we are with de-coupling in the various jurisdictions.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We've been working on that the on the gas side. On the electric side, we are certainly aware that as we implement conservation that we need to start thinking if not de-coupling some other methods that keep us whole and that's really where we are. Scott I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: Most of our focus has been on trying to get loss margin recovery for our conservation programs We made some progress in Colorado and in Minnesota on that through various incentive measures. And a broader decoupling look is something we have begun discussions about, but I would say they're in the early discussion phase.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Adams Please go ahead.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Yeah, hi good morning. I wanted to ask a question about your smart metering initiatives. It's my understanding that you have kind of a very targeted deployment in Boulder right now. Just wondering if you could bring us up to date there and maybe give us a sense of when you might look to potentially expand that program.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are absolutely right it is targeted. It's in Boulder. The project itself is about $100 million. We're funding $15 million of that and it's really an A to Z proof-of-concept pilot program where we really start to understand what smart grid can mean in terms of carbon reduction, efficiency, conservation efforts, and reliability. And we're going to understand those things as we implement the pilot program and it's been very well received. And we'll be in a better position I believe at the vend next year to assess what makes sense to discuss with our commissions about taking forward to the next step.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: Okay. If I could just follow up briefly is that… have you chosen the technology for that or is that something that's still open?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's still open. We have vendor and partners that are making the contributions but we're still relatively open to technology choices.
Chip Moore - Canaccord Adams: All right thanks for taking my questions.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Hello. Was wondering what regulatory steps you plan on taking or have to take to adjust to these lower demands forecast, particularly in these two years and then how that might affect kind of in the post-2009 and certainly in Minnesota since you said most of that demand reduction you have seen there.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well Travis, I mean the most immediate step as you have mentioned in Minnesota is filing a rate case, which we plan to do In Minnesota after you file you are allowed to implement interim rates sixty days later. And so we will file with the assumption, our best assumptions at this point suggest that sales will remain flat next year and so you pick that up in a rate case. As Scott had mentioned if we are a leader in conservation among other environmental leadership efforts and we are looking at various ways to compensate for the margin we made a lot of progress on that, also in things... sustain things like de-coupling and what have you could potentially be items that we discussed, but at this point we don't find that to be necessary.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Do you have a projection for '08 on your earned returns, based on what's happened in third quarter. How that would be affected in Minnesota?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Earned returns as far as ROEs?
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Yeah.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I mean, I think your ROEs depending on the jurisdiction, remember we have a little extra leverage at the holdco. We'll probably be in the low 9s depending on the jurisdiction it will depend. But that's the sort of information that will true up and we'll be better able to speak to you as we issue formal guidance.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Thank you very much
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Travis that would be about where we... that would be consistent with roughly where we are this year too.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: That would be in the rate case the low 9%?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, no. You asked... I'm glad you followed up on th1at. We'll ask for an ROE that is reflective of current capital conditions.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Sure.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But on a consolidated basis you have-- if we're in multiple jurisdictions we have gas and electric operations. You have a lot of different things. So at the end of the day we don't typically and haven't typically been earning our authorized ROEs.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Sure okay. The low 9 figure you gave was for Minnesota 2008 earned.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Its Minnesota 2008 yeah, that's probably approximately right.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Dan.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Hi, how are you.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Just first I want to follow up on the nuclear outage expense deferral process. So, I guess going forward so that will smooth out your accounting too I would assume then, so your results won't vary as much based on when there's outages and when there are not. Is that true?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah that's correct.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: And so what would be I guess kind of that normalized level? Is there a year that's kind of typical of what you would expect that on a smoothed basis?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well an outage… what does an outage typically run? 25 million? So you'll just start to see 25 million I guess, I'm not going to try to run the numbers, but you will see that cost amortized over the refueling outage for all three of our units.
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director, Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer: So you know Dan the way to look at it there's three units. In some years you have two outages, some years you have one. So it's going to be some where in that $25 million to $50 million per nuclear outage assuming kind of financial length etcetera.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. You mentioned that if you under spend that you have to refund that. What about if the costs are above what was in the rate case? Is there a mechanism for recovering that?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Dan I think just remember that we're going into a rate case next year. So it's all going get trued up. And the Commission was just concerned that before we go into… they could have easily said that let's address that in a rate case. They appreciated the accounting change and they just wanted to make sure that it didn't create essentially a windfall for us. So they went back and we looked at what was the last embedded thing in the rate case that we had previously filed and said don't recover any more of that. Now when we go into next year, that all gets trued up.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. So it's really just kind of [inaudible]?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, it for another three months.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Right. The next rate case cycle essentially.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. I appreciate also that you put in the information on the liquidity and all of that. But I was curious, going forward, what your funding needs are going to be given market conditions. So it looks like you don't have much maturities until the second half of '09.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's correct Dan. We have a light maturity schedule next year. What's on the plate for us either this year or early next is the 200…up to I should family size that a $250 million bond at SPS, and then we have an additional 200… an additional 450 of maturities at NSP-Minnesota and [inaudible]. I think our total financing needs excluding SPS next year will probably roughly be in the $800 million range, and they will be first mortgage bonds that we'll be issuing. So the steps we've taken issuing equity, getting ahead of our funding needs this year, I think have really put us in a good position in '09. And even stepping back as I mentioned on the call, we've always looked at what we call liquidity traps. We took advantage of the mark when they were strong to roll our credit facilities. We had a $600 million maturity at the holding company in 2010 We reduced that maturity by taking half of it and spreading it out to 2017 So we've always been sensitive to liquidity and we've always tried to get ahead of it and not have it be on top of us.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Danielle Sykes with Sykes Research [ph]. Please go ahead.
Danielle Sykes - Sykes Research: Hi Ben, actually you just answered my question. Thank you very much.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III: - VP and CFO
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, July 31st of 2008. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead sir.
Paul A. Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy's second quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. I am Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. With me is Ben Fowke, Vice President and CFO of Xcel Energy and several others who can answer your questions. Today we plan to cover our second quarter results and provide a general business update. Please note that there are slides that accompany this conference call, which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of the comments that we may make may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filing with the SEC. Today's discussion will focus on ongoing results, which we believe represents fundamental earnings call of Xcel Energy. Please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings. Before I turn the call over to Ben, I will cover up overall results and how we calculate ongoing earnings. Second quarter 2008 GAAP earnings were $106 million or $0.24 per share compared to $69 million for $0.15 per share in 2007. As you may recall, in 2007 we reached a settlement resolving our dispute with the IRS regarding our COLI program. Our 2008 second quarter earning results do not include any material impacts from the discontinued COLI program. However, our 2007 second quarter GAAP earnings include a loss of $0.11 per share associated with the resolution of this dispute. This morning's discussion will focus on ongoing earnings, which excludes the impact of COLI from our results. Ongoing earnings for the second quarter of 2008 were $0.24 per share versus $0.27 per share for last year. With that I will turn the call over to Ben. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Paul and welcome everyone. As Paul just mentioned our ongoing earnings was $0.24 per share for the second quarter of 2008 compared with $0.27 per share a year ago. While our ongoing results for the quarter declined, our year-to-date results are ahead of last year. For the first six months of the year ongoing earnings was $0.59 per share, which is up $0.05 from last year. As a result, we expect to deliver earnings within our guidance range of a $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Now let's take a closer look at the details. Second quarter 2008 ongoing earnings decreased by $0.03 compared to the same period last year largely due to higher O&M expense, which reduced earnings by $0.04 per share and lower electric utility margins which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. These negative items were slightly offset by higher natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Starting with the top of the income statement electric margin decreased by about $6 million due to a combination of factors. On a positive side, our electric rate increased in Wisconsin and interim rate increased in North Dakota and MERP rider combined to increase electric margin by $14 million this quarter. Next in light of current economic conditions we are encouraged that our well diversified mix of electric customers generated normalized sales growth of 2.5% during the quarter, driven largely by a 3.2% increase in commercial and industrial sales. This increase in C&I sales is related primarily to strengthen energy and agricultural-based industries, particularly at the PSCo and SPS. Based on sales growth of 2.5%, we estimate that our margin increase by $12 million. However, because a greater portion of our sales, which are the C&I class, we saw lower levels of margin contribution as compared to residential customers. In addition, we also experienced some adverse impacts in rate design between energy and demand charges. Combination of these factors, which we refer to as sales mix in our margin table, reduced electric margin by $13 million for the quarter. As previously mentioned, we experienced cooler weather than last year, which reduced electric utility margins by $19 million. For more information on other items that had an impact on electric margins for the quarter, please refer to the table on our earnings release. Turning to natural gas margins, the rate increases in Colorado and Wisconsin, cooler weather and other items combined to increase natural gas margins by $13 million. Moving on to O&M expenses, second quarter O&M increased $29 million or 6.9%. Several items contributed to the second quarter increase, including higher plant operating costs, which reflects an increase in both planned and unplanned outages. In addition we also experienced higher labor costs due to general cost increases and additional employees to support our growth initiatives. As we discussed at our analyst meeting in December, we have filed a request with the Minnesota Commission to change how we account for nuclear refueling cost. Under the proposed plan, the refueling cost would be deferred and amortized between refueling outages. As opposed to [inaudible]. A request is pending and we expect the Minnesota Commission to rule on it before the end of September. Assuming we are successful in our pending request, we expect our annual O&M expense to increase by 2% to 3%, in line with our guidance. Next, second quarter depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1 million or 0.7%. This decrease is primarily due to timing associated with Commission approval of NSP-Minnesota's remaining lives depreciation filings in the third quarter of 2007. As you develop your quarterly models keep in mind that we recorded a year-to-date true-up that reduced depreciation expense, by approximately $31 million during the third quarter of 2007. As a result, depreciation expense was higher in the first half of 2007 and then lower in the second half of last year. Overall, [inaudible] $0.04 per share and lower electric utility margins, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. These negative items were slightly offset by higher natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. And starting with the top of the income statement, electric margin decreased by about $6 million due to a combination of factors. On the positive side, an electrical rate increase in Wisconsin and interim rate increase in North Dakota and MERP rider combined to increase electric margin by $14 million this quarter. Next, in light of current economic conditions, we are encouraged that our well diversified mix of electric customers generated normalized sales growth of 2.5% during the quarter, driven largely by a 3.2% increase in commercial and industrial sale. This increase in C&I sales is related primarily to strength in energy and agricultural based industries particularly at PSCo and SPS. Based on sales growth of 2.5%, we estimate that our margin increase by $12 million. However, because a greater portion of our sales, which were the C&I class, we saw lower levels of margin contribution as compared to residential customers. In addition, we also experienced some adverse impacts in rate design between energy and demand charges. A combination of these factors which we refer to as sales mix in our margin table reduced electric margin by $13 million for the quarter. Finally, as previously mentioned, we experienced cooler weather than last year, which reduced electric utility margins by $19 million. For more information on other items that had an impact on electric margins for the quarter, please refer to the table on our earnings release. Turning to natural gas margins, rate increases in Colorado and Wisconsin, cooler weather and other items combined to increase natural gas margins by $13 million. Moving on to O&M expenses, second-quarter O&M increased $29 million or 6.9%. Several items contributed to the second quarter increase including higher planned operating costs, which reflects an increase in both planned and unplanned outages. In addition, we also experienced higher labor costs, due to general cost increases, and additional employees to support our growth initiatives. As we discussed at our INOs [ph] meeting in December, we have filed a request with the Minnesota Commission to change how we account for nuclear refueling cost. Under the purposed plan, the refueling cost would be deferred and amortized between refueling outages, as opposed to expense as the cost to incur. A request is pending and we expect the Minnesota Commission to rule on it before the end of September. Assuming we are successful in our pending request, we expect our annual O&M expense to increase by 2% to 3% in line with our guidance. Next, second quarter depreciation and amortization expense decreased $1 million our 0.7%. This decrease is primarily due to timing associated with Commission approval of NSP-Minnesota's remaining life's depreciation filing in the third quarter of 2007. As you develop your quarterly models, keep in mind, that we recorded a year-to-date true up that reduced depreciation expense by approximately $31 million during the third quarter of 2007. As a result, depreciation expense was higher in the first half of 2007 and then lower in the second half of last year. Overall, for the full-year, we expect depreciation to increase $55 million to $65 million, in line with our annual guidance. That explains significant quarterly deviations; let me give you a brief regulatory update. Let we start with NSP-Minnesota. We have filed a rate request to increase electric rates in North Dakota by $17.9 million based on an equity ratio of 51.8%, an ROE of 10.75% and rate base of approximately $242 million. Interim rates of about $17 million went into effect in early February 2008. The North Dakota staff is currently recommending a rate increase of approximately $4.9 million. We expect a Commission decision later this fall. At SPS we have filed a rate case to increase electric rates by $15.6 million in New Mexico. The request is based on an historic test year, and includes an ROE of 10.7% rate base of $307 million and an equity ratio of about 51%. In July the hearing examiner recommended a rate increase of $12.6 million based on an ROE of 10.14%. We expect a Commission decision in August. In March 2008 SPS filed a wholesale case seeking an annual rate increase of almost $15 million, based on a requested ROE of 12.2%. On May 30, 2008 the FERC [ph] conditionally accepted and suspended the rates and established hearing and settlement procedures. The Commission granted a one-day suspension of rates instead of 180 days. The base rates based on a 10.25% ROE will become effective with the in-service date of Lea Power project. In June 2008, SPS filed a rate case with the Public Utility Commission of Texas seeking a net annual rate increase of approximately $61 million. The rate filing includes a requested ROE of 11.25%, an electric rate base of $989 million and an equity ratio of 51%. In SPS’ last Texas rate case, the parties agreed that SPS seek in this rate filings interim rate relief of $18 million per year for the Lea Power purchase agreement. The interim rates are proposed to go into effect when Lea Power comes online in 2008. We're still on the early stages of this case. We expect final rates to go into affect in early 2009. As most of you are aware, last year we filed resource plans in both Colorado and Minnesota. These plans demonstrate how we can meet increasing customer demands for energy while reducing overall carbon emissions in a cost effective manner. Clearance in Colorado have concluded. We expect the Commission to rule on the first phase of the Colorado resource plan in the third quarter. In Minnesota the process is going well and we should have a decision by the end of 2008. In both states we remain confident that we will receive constructive decisions, which allow us to make the investments to deliver on our environmental initiatives. In summary, while our results declined for the quarter our year-to-date ongoing earnings are $0.05 ahead of last year. We're confident we can deliver earnings within our annual earnings guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. So with that let's open it up for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi Paul.
Operator: Mr. Ridzon your line is open. Please go ahead.
Paul Ridzon: I'm sorry. I was on mute. I had a question on smoothing out the nuke refuel costs? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes.
Paul Ridzon: When do you expect that decision, is that an '08 issue to watch? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. We expect a decision in September. Assuming we are successful that will reduce O&M within the Minnesota jurisdiction by about $25 million. So, that's why Paul, we are optimistic about the outcome and that should get us right back in line with our annual O&M guidance.
Paul Ridzon: So, your guidance continues upon getting that regulatory approval? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It was... we would assume successful outcome of that approval when we developed a 2% to 3% guidance range last year.
Paul Ridzon: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dave Parker with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi, Dave.
David E. Parker: Hi, good morning. Just a question on what you term sort of the shift or the rate design issue. Could you provide a little more color on that? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. There is a couple of things that are happening Dave. I mean as I mentioned, we have seen I think pretty strong sales growth; break it down to a couple of different ways. In Colorado, we're actually seeing pretty good growth in both residential and the C&I plans. And SPS it’s primarily a large C&I, at NSP-Minnesota, quite a bit of a decline from what we have expected coming into the year. Now, within those classes, we're seeing far more sales from C&I than residential and C&I has a lower unit margin contribution associated with it. In addition, within the C&I class, we're actually seeing more sales come from larger C&I customers, basically energy services customers, then some of the smaller C&I classes. So, they also have a smaller margin contribution per Kwh sale. The rate design issues that I referred to, have to do with the fact that we did implement new rates in Colorado and SPS and we shifted around some of the components of demand and energy in Colorado. And in SPS we actually implemented seasonal rates that we implemented last year. So, you have lower winter rates and higher summer rates. So we're seeing some of the effects of that. Overall Dave, while this was obviously something that happened within the quarter and something we will monitor going-forward, we don't necessary think this is a trend at all. And in fact, we're pretty pleased that, our economies are showing a resiliency that they seem to have as evidenced by overall sales coming in strong.
David E. Parker: Yes. Have you bet... mostly for explaining sales of across all customer classes. Is it your C&I... the sales pick up is that because you... of just... I think you mentioned earlier maybe the E&P segments going well obviously at Texas but AT other places as well? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, very much Texas but also in Colorado, which is... having a resurge in and is becoming an energy state now in oil and gas, but also the commodity side with mining. So we're seeing a lot of that and even the residential side in Colorado is coming through okay. It is bit flat up here Dave in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
David E. Parker: Okay. Thank you very much. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anne Paul [ph] with Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi Anne.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Good afternoon actually. Two questions I have on the income statement you have a conservation demand [ph] by management expenses, was about 44% in the quarter. Can you kind of go through what's in it and then what kind of trend do you see going forward? And the second question has to do with your accounts receivable and bad debts, can you clarify how bad it is, since you have some headline news about shutting off some of the services? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Let's... Okay, let's address the first one, demand side management and the various conservation programs we have. We are implementing state policy we have always been, I think on the forefront of demand side management we're stepping that up Anne. As our states have asked us to do, those… the expenses, the same for Saver Switches and various interruptible programs and all the other things you do to conserve energy, which we think are very important, those expenses are increasing, we get very timely recovery of those as well. So if you look at the margin table you'll see some increases in what we are picking up in margin as a result of those programs. So that's... I hope the explanation you were looking for on the conservation programs. Turning to accounts receivable on bad debt, we are... well you've read those headlines. The reality is our bad debt is tracking just like it has been over the last couple of years. So there has been some shut offs, etcetera but bad debts... we are forecasting bad debt to be right on top of where it was in '07, which is about where it was in '06. And I take that as a sign of just how much more disciplined we have become in our collection processes in our rate design. And you may remember that in Colorado, we didn't have a late fee until the last rate case for residential customers. So all of those things combined I think are preventing the bad debt from rising out of control.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with SAC Capital. Please go ahead. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi, Ashar.
Ashar Khan: Hi, how are you doing? If I understood correctly you said, if you get this ruling on the O&M you would be able to reverse certain expenses am I right if I understand it correctly? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, I mean what we are looking to do is amortize those refueling cost over the full refueling period. Typically 18 months, it depends on the plan. This is a year that you recall that we have two outages versus last year we had one. The filing itself ask for that accounting change, which we think, is a best practice to be effective at the beginning of the year and we have filed this quite some time ago. It's a bit backed up because of the number of dockets that the staff is working through. If we are successful that should reduce O&M expense by about $25 million, or roughly Ashar one refueling outage cost, typically.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And so if it comes in September, you book it in the third quarter. Correct? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That's correct.
Ashar Khan: And if it is after September, it will get booked in the fourth quarter? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It will get booked in the fourth quarter and again we are asking for treatment effect at the beginning of the year.
Ashar Khan: And what is the plan with the Colorado rate case, the timing and the test year? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well it'll be a forward test year, at the timing of that we are still working through, as we make sure that the filing incorporates [inaudible] and when that is anticipated to come online. So, we're working through some of the filed details there but we will be filing a rate case in Colorado I think it'll be subject to the things that I just described.
Ashar Khan: Okay. But this year or no? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It should be this year, if possibly very beginning of the next year and again Ashar that would be I'm sure that would be basically our assessment of what make sense to incorporate the various projects that are coming in the service during that timeframe.
Ashar Khan: Okay. And then, could you just talk... could give you some ROE information on the different subs. What they're earning right now on an LTM basis? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I would say that, by and large most of the SPS continues to struggle as you might imagine, Colorado and Minnesota are probably slightly under earning based upon their authorized returns. Wisconsin is in a similar situation. So, did I give you a little bit of color Ashar.
Ashar Khan: Yes, that's fine. That's fine. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Shites with Shites Research [ph]. Please go ahead. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi Daniel.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. I just was wondering if from the hearings that has been taking place regarding resource plans in both states, is there anything that would assume some changes in your… potential changes in your CapEx scheduler or most of it is pretty much in line so far? Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I would say probably most of it's in line Daniel. I mean, you recall that when we issued our CapEx forecast last year, we had a pretty large amount of CapEx and what we call potential. And if I recall right it was, I think anywhere between $800 million to $1.4 billion, depending upon how these resource plans come out, what opportunities we find it to invest, what the Commission decide they would like us to invest in versus continue to purchase. We're working through those, a little too early to tell but, I mean, again I think we'll get outcomes that allow us to make the kind of investment we want to make. We have a 500 megawatt RFP out here in Minnesota for basic return key vendors, those bids we've been very happy with the quality of the bids we have seen and we think that will give us some good opportunities but, stay tuned we'll [inaudible] year.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Okay.
Operator: Thank you and management, I'm seeing that there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to you for closing comments. Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, I appreciate your questions and your interest and if you have any more follow-up questions as always contact Paul Johnson, or the rest of the IR team and I look forward to seeing you soon in the various conferences we all attend. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Xcel Energy's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We do thank you again for your participation and at this time you may disconnect. Have a nice day.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-01 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director of IR Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - VP and CFO
Analysts: Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets
Operator: Welcome to the Xcel Energy first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions from members of the investment community only. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded today, May 1st, 2008. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations and Assistant Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director of Investor Relations: Thank you, and welcome to Xcel Energy's first quarter 2008 earnings release. I'm Paul Johnson. With me today is Ben Fowke, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Xcel Energy, and several others who can help answer your questions. Today we plan to cover our first quarter results and provide a general business update. Please note that there are slides that accompany this conference call which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today, our discussion will focus on ongoing results which we believe represents the fundament earnings power of Xcel Energy. Before I turn the call over to Ben, I will cover our overall results and how we calculate ongoing earnings. We are pleased to report that first quarter 2008 GAAP earnings were $153 million or $0.35 per share compared with $120 million or $0.28 per share in 2007. As you recall during the second half of 2007, we reached a settlement resolving our dispute with the IRS regarding our COLI program. Our 2008 first quarter earnings results do not include any material impacts from the discontinued COLI program. However our 2000 first quarter results included earnings of $0.01 per share associated with the COLI program. This morning's discussion will focus on ongoing earnings which exclude the impact of COLI on our results. Ongoing earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $.035 per share versus $0.27 per share, last year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Paul and welcome everyone. As Paul just mentioned, this morning we reported ongoing earnings of $0.35 per share compared to $0.27 per share a year ago. As you look into the details you will notice that some of the 30% increase in quarterly earnings is due to timing. It will also be clear that we're off to a great start. Let's take a closer look at the details. First quarter 2008 ongoing earnings increased by $0.08 compared to the same period last year, largely due to the higher electric margins which increased earnings by $0.07 per share and higher natural gas margins which increased earnings by $0.03 per share. These positive items were slightly offset by higher O&M expense, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Starting with the top of the income statement, electric margin increased by about $49 million due to several factors. We experienced normalized electric sales growth of 2.1%, which increase margin by $10 million. In addition to normalized sales growth, an extra day of sales from the leap year increased margin by $9 million and cooler whether this year increased margin by $3 million. And electric increase was constant and interim rate increase in North Dakota and various riders combined to increase electric margin by $23 million for this quarter. For more information on the other items that had an impact on electric margin for the quarter, please refer to the table in our earnings release. Turning to natural gas margins, rate increases in Colorado and Wisconsin, cool weather and other items combined to increase natural gas margins by $25 million. A few items partially offset the increases in electric and natural gas margins that I just discussed. Let's look at those partial effects starting with operating expenses. First quarter O&M expenses increased approximately $15 million or 3.3%. Several items contributed to the increase, including higher planned operating cost, timing of nuclear outages, and increases in contract labor and consulting costs. In addition, we had increased spending on conservation programs. Our conservation program costs are recovered in revenue and expenses are offset with increased margin. A positive trend we saw on the quarter were lower benefit costs, which was largely due to improved employee healthcare experience and a change to a high deductible healthcare plan. Moving on, first quarter depreciation and amortization expense increased $6 million or 2.8% driven by normal system expansion. As you develop your quarterly models keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2007, the Minnesota Commission approved our depreciation life filing, and we recorded a year-to-date true up that reduced depreciation expense. As a result, depreciation expense was higher in the first half of 2007, and then lower in the second half of the year. That explains the significant quarterly deviations. Now let me give you a quick regulatory update. The cases that we had filed are not expected to have a material impact on 2008, but will contribute in 2009 and demonstrates our focus on earning our authorized return in each of our jurisdictions. Last July, SPS filed to increase electric rates by about $17 million in New Mexico. The request is based on a historic test year and includes an ROE of 11%, rate base of $307 million, and an equity ratio of about 51%. Intervener testimony was filed in March. The staff recommended an $8 million increase based on a 9.1% ROE. While the attorney general recommended a $2 million decrease based on a 9.2% ROE, and a consolidated tax adjustment. Hearings were held in April, we anticipate a decision later this summer. In December 2007, NSP-Minnesota filed to increase North Dakota electric rates by just over $20 million, based on an equity ratio of 51.8% and ROE of 11.5% and rate base of approximately $242 million. Interim rates of $17.2 million went into affect in early February 2008. We reached the stipulation with the staff for an ROE of 10.75% and this stipulation is subject to approval by the commission. The staff will file testimony on all other issues in May and we expect this decision later this summer. During the first quarter, we filed two wholesale rate cases. In February, PSCo requested a $12.5 million increase in wholesale rates based on an ROE of 11.5%. The request was composed of an $8.8 million of traditional base rate recovery and $3.7 million of DRIP recovery of Comanche 3 and Fort St. Vrain. In March, PSCo reached agreements which resolved all issues and increased annual revenue by $6.6 million with AFUDC continuing for Comanche and Fort St. Vrain. The agreement will allow us to expedite the implementation of new rates by several months. It also allows us to implement new rates in a more timely fashion, when Comanche 3 comes into service in 2009. The agreements are pending a FERC decision and rates could go into effect in May. In March SPS also fought a wholesale case, seeking an annual rate increase of almost $15 million, based on a requested ROE of 12.2%, a decision by FERC is expected later in 2008. In April, we received a FERC order in the 2004 SPS wholesale customer complaint case. The FERC approved us settlement agreement with Golden Spread and Occidental. The order also addressed base rates and fuel disputes. In a base rate case we were disappointed that the FERC approved a 9.3% ROE, but the effect is limited to the 18-month period from January 2005 to June 2006. We have since entered into more favorable settlement with all of our wholesale customers for the subsequent period. In the fuel dispute, the FREC found that incremental costs should be assigned to most of our market base sales. But determined that the new methodology be applied as of January 1st, 2005, rather than that through 1999, as recommended by the ALJ. The order is subject to some interpretation, but we don't expect that the fuel refunds to our fuel requirement customers will exceed $11 million, which we have fully reserved for. More importantly through this decision and pending approval of other settlements, we are bringing closure to this last piece of the system average fuel dispute, that has had an adverse impact on SPS since 2005. We also took regulatory action to extend and increase the output of our nuclear power plants. This is a key component of our plants to meet our customers growing demand for energy, while reducing CO2 emission in a cost effective manner. During the first quarter, NSP-Minnesota filed an application with the Minnesota Commission to increase the capacity at our Monticello Nuclear facility by 70 megawatts. The cost of the project is estimated between $100 million to $135 million, which represents a cost of less than 2000 a KW even at the high side of the estimate. In April, NSP-Minnesota filed with the NRC to extend the operating life of its two nuclear reactors at Prairie Island. We are in the process of finalizing a certificate of need application, which will be filed later this spring with the Minnesota Commission. This application will seek to increase the number of spent fuel storage containers at Prairie Island, to support the license extensions. We also intend to seek approval to increase the output of Prairie Island by 160 megawatts. As most of you are aware, last year, we filed resource plans in the both Colorado and Minnesota that provide a foundation of our strategic initiatives over the next decade. These plants demonstrate how we can meet increasing customer demands for energy, while reducing overall carbon emissions in a cost effective manner. We are currently in the discovery stages of the process. We expect that hearings will occur in the second half of the year, and we should have a decision in both states by the end of 2008 or in early 2009. Now I would like to quickly update you on our construction projects, which are being managed very well. We continued to make significant progress with our emission reduction effort in Minnesota. So far, we spent approximately $900 million, which represents approximately 85% of the total capital expenditures related to MERP. Construction on the High Bridge Combined Cycle Project is nearly complete. The plant should be online this month and is forecasted to be significantly under budget. Construction on the Riverside Combined Cycle Project is about 40% complete and is scheduled to be operational in May of 2009. With significant portions of the project either completed or under contract, we expect to earn an ROE of about 10.7% on the project through a MERP rider. In Colorado, Comanche 3 construction is approximately 50% complete and we spent approximately $585 million, which represents about 55% of the estimated total cost. All major contracts are signed and a vast majority of the engineering and procurement is complete. Comanche 3 remains on track and on budget. Another way to look at the success of the project is based on installed cost. The cost of Comanche 3 is under 1,500 per K/w, when you consider just the cost of the plant itself. The all in [ph] cost of Comanche 3 is just 1,900 per K/w, if you include the cost of transmission and environmental retrofits that units wanted to. This is significantly below the cost of building a new coal plant and it further highlights the significant value Comanche 3 will provide to our customers when it comes online in 2009. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and accomplishments. In addition, during the first quarter, we raised $900 million of favorable terms despite market volatility to help officially fund our build to core strategy. With a good start to the year, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. So with that let's open it up for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session for members of the investment community only. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Hello. Good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Dan how are you?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Very good. I was wondering on the… your rate filing in North Dakota, were you stipulated on the ROE. What's the revenue impact of what you filed versus using the new ROE, how much does that take the rate request down?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The overall rate request was for just over $20 million. Interim rates went to effect at $70 million. The 10.75% ROE agreement…
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director of Investor Relations: It would be a less than $1 million.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Very minimal.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay. So…
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And there are some other issues, Dan, that they'll have to decide as well and that's what they are filing testimony on, but we do expect to get a decision by the end of… early in the summer.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay. And then just kind of a status in Minnesota, do you see any need in this calendar year to do any more… any rate proceedings in Minnesota at all?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You mean like a general rate case?
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Right. What's your, kind of what your ROE, your earning, versus what you… you are allowed in Minnesota?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In Minnesota it will continue to track how the… the performance of this year and what the forecasted performance of next year will be and if we need to follow rate case we will. But we haven't made any determination on that yet.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay. And then the last thing I was wondering about is, when you talked about the lower employee benefit expenses in the first quarter. Do you expect that level to be sustained or were there unusual items that caused the first quarter to be lower than maybe what you have going forward. Do you have a feel for that?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I don't know if you can commit to taking of quarterly trend and taking it through a full year. But we are happy to see the lower experience rates. I think that has a lot to do with the change in rate plan design. Perhaps it's showing some of the benefits of some of our more proactive health awareness programs. And I think based upon the rate plan designs, employees are taking more ownership of their healthcare cost in dollars. And so I think we will continue to see a benefit from it. I just couldn't tell you if the trend line will continue.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, thank you.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dan
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Paul.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Hey Ben. How are you?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: You talked about timing issues, was that just a depreciation and could you go through that again? Sorry.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The primary timing issue was depreciation, which you remember, as I said in my prepared remarks, we made a depreciation life extension last year that was approved by the Minnesota Commission. So we did a catch-up entry since it was retro back to the beginning of the year. But that entry didn't happen to the third quarter of last year. So you are going to have a little bit of variance there.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And I notice in your… kind of your modeling assumptions you have ratcheted up the share count [inaudible]. How do you plan to raise that… that way?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'm not sure what you are talking about?
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That the fourth quarter release said you used $433 million diluted share and now that's at 438.
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director of Investor Relations: Well, the 438 Paul, that relates to that assumption has been for 2008 since the fourth quarter. The 434 was a 2007 assumption and the increase in the share count captures the DRIP program, the benefit programs that we have that are equity based.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Paul, keeping mind that we issued DRIP and other benefit plan equity that ranges between $60 million and $70 million a year.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: In fact, I was looking at your fourth quarter release and it kind of, I guess I grabbed the wrong release real quick this morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay I will talk to you offline on it.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That sounds good.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. At this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke, III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well thanks everyone for participating the call this morning. Probably see many of you next week at the AGA Conference in Miami. In the meantime, if you got any follow-up questions please call Paul Johnson or the IR team and we will take your calls and thanks again and look forward to seeing you many of you soon.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for standing by and welcome to the Xcel Energy 2007 year-end earnings conference call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode and following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Paul A. Johnson - Managing Director, Investor Relations: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2007 year-end earnings release conference call. I am Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today is Ben Fowke, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy and several others who are here to help answer your questions. Today we plan to cover our 2007 year-end results and accomplishments. Please note there are slides that accompany the conference call, which are available on our web page. Let me remind you that some of our comments may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. Today, our discussion will focus on ongoing results, which we believe represents the fundamental earnings call of Xcel Energy. Before I turn the call over to Ben, I will cover our overall financial results and how we calculate ongoing earnings. We are pleased to report that 2007 ongoing earnings per share, which exclude the impact of our discontinued company-owned life insurance program or COLI came in at $1.43 per share, which compares with ongoing earnings of a $1.30 per share for 2006. In 2007, we reached a settlement resolving our dispute with the IRS regarding our COLI program. As a result we surrendered our COLI policies last year and don't expect any further tax benefits of our costs associated with COLI in the future. The net impact of the COLI settlement and earnings associated with the program were $0.08 per share reduction in 2007 GAAP earnings. In contrast, the COLI program contributed earnings of $0.05 per share to 2006 GAAP earnings. In addition, in 2006 we had $0.01 of earnings from discontinued operations due to regulatory reseves for cost estimates. Our GAAP earnings, which include the impact of COLI and discontinued operations, were $1.35 per share in 2007 compared to $1.36 per share for 2006. With that I will turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks and welcome everyone. As Paul mentioned our 2007 ongoing earnings per share were $1.43, which exceed our earnings guidance range of $1.38 to $1.42 per share. This compares with ongoing earnings of $1.30 per share in 2006. The $0.13 per share increase is largely due to higher electric retail margins, which increased earnings by $0.31 per share and higher natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.08 per share. These positive factors were offset by higher utility O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.14 per share, higher financing costs, which decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, lower short-term wholesale margins, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, and other items including higher depreciation and a higher effective tax rate, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share. Well, that summarizes the year-end results. So let's walk through some of the details starting at the top of the income statement. Our retail electric utility margins increased by $219 million or $0.31 per share for the year largely driven by rate increases and sales growth. Electric margin grew by $141 million from various rate increases, including $112 million from the electric rate increases in Colorado and $29 million from the MERP rider. We also had strong sales with weather adjusted electric sales growth of 1.7%, which increased electric margin by $49 million. Weather also had a positive impact with warmer summer temperatures increasing electric sales and margins by $16 million. These positive components were slightly offset by a few items. Most notably, increased capacity cost reduced electric margin by $27 million. For more information please refer to the electric margin table in our earnings release. Higher natural gas margins, which increased $53 million or $0.08 per share also had a positive impact. The most significant factors on the natural gas side were rate increases in Colorado, Minnesota, and North Dakota, which increased margin by $21 million. In addition colder winter temperatures increased gas margins by $16 million compared with 2006. Sales growth, transportation margins, and other miscellaneous items increased natural gas margins by a total of $16 million. As I mentioned, weather was a positive driver for both electric and gas margin. Actual temperatures in 2007 increased gas and electric earnings by a total of $0.06 per share compared with normal weather or $0.04 compared with 2006. The positive weather impact helped to offset over $30 million of reserves and disallowances that we experienced at SPS in 2007. Turning to operating expenses, O&M expenses increased $100 million or 5.7% in 2007, largely driven by higher operating at our generating plants, higher labor and contracting cost, and increase in our conservation programs and donations both of which had revenue offsets. In addition, we had some one-time credits, which reduced O&M expenses in 2006 such as the reversal of a regulatory reserve for nuclear private fuel storage cost that are now recovered from customers. In addition, gains on sales of assets also reduced O&M expenses in 2006. As you may have noticed, our O&M expenses came in a bit higher than our guidance range. As we done in the past, we took advantage of the increased earnings from weather to spend additional O&M dollars. This allowed us to deliver strong earnings while maintaining our system. We expect O&M expenses this year to increase by 2% to 3%. Moving on, a depreciation expense was relatively flat increasing only $5 million in 2007 but this is an indicative of a trend. Normal depreciation increases were largely offset by the Minnesota Commission’s approval of our filing to extend a depreciable life of our Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years and by adjustments to depreciable lives from the Texas rate case settlement. Both of which combine to reduce depreciation expense by approximately $45 million for the year. We anticipate depreciation expense will increase $60 million to $70 million in 2008, reflecting our growing capital investment program. Finally, let me touch on taxes. Our effective tax rate for 2007 based on GAAP results was 33.8% compared with 24.2% in 2006. Part of the difference is due to COLI. In addition, in 2006 we recognized approximately $30 million of tax benefits relating to the utilization of capital loss carry forwards and a reversal of a regulatory tax reserve. So, that's a more detail look at our financial results. Next I'd like to summarize some of our significant 2007 accomplishments. Well, let's start with COLI. In 2007 we reached a settlement that resolved our longstanding COLI dispute with the IRS in a positive manner. The COLI situation presented a significant financial risk that we were happy to say we have eliminated. On the regulatory front we completed rate cases that provided more than $100 million of rate relief including electric cases in Texas and Wisconsin and natural gas cases in Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. As many of you know our SPS operating company has underperformed financially for several years. In 2007, we were able to resolve field disputes in Texas, enhance settlements pending approval in New Mexico, and with our largest wholesale customer at the FERC. While we still have some outstanding issues with other wholesale customers at the FERC we have reduced our exposure and have set the stage for improved financial performance at SPS. We also filed a couple of other cases in 2007 that will have an impact in 2008 including a request to increase electric rates by above $20 million in North Dakota and a request to increase electric rates in New Mexico by about $17 million. In 2007 we also filed resource plans in both Colorado and Minnesota that provide the foundation for our strategic initiatives over the next decade. In general, the plans demonstrate how we can meet energy demand and legislative requirements while reducing overall carbon emissions in a cost-effective manner. For example, our resource plan in Minnesota would reduce carbon emissions by 22% in 2020 from 2005 levels. It would add 26,000 megawatts of new wind generation by 2020. It would extend the lives of our nuclear plants and expand capacity by 230 megawatts. It would increase the capacity of our Sherco plant by 80 megawatts while making significant reductions in overall sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions from the facility. And finally the plan would add approximately 2,300 megawatts of new natural gas-fired generation. In Colorado, our resource plan would reduce carbon emissions by at least 10% by 2017 and put PSCo on a path to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 20% by 2020. The plan would increase wind resources by 800 megawatts by 2015. It would acquire approximately 25 megawatts from a central solar facility with plans to bring in a plant of up to 200 megawatts as technology develops. And finally, it would replace four coal burning units with a highly efficient natural gas generating facility reducing carbon emissions by 1.4 million tons each year. Both resource plans in Minnesota and Colorado increased our use of renewable energy and not only reduce carbon emissions but also reduce our reliance on coal and natural gas. The plans also reflect our desire to earn a larger percentage of the incremental generation coming on to our system, which we think will benefit both customers and shareholders. With that in mind we moved forward on the ownership fund in 2007. In Minnesota, we signed a contract to build a 100-megawatt wind farm. All of the permits are in place for the wind farm and it should be completed this year. The project is recoverable through a proposed renewable rider in Minnesota. We also recently issued an RFP in Minnesota for an additional 500 megawatts to 750 megawatts of wind generation with potential ownership of up to 500 megawatts. In Colorado, we expect to issue an RFP this quarter. In the meantime we file to expand our Port Saint range [ph] facility to include two natural gas combustion turbines. This project will place the PPA and increase capacity by almost 300 megawatts. Another significant accomplishment in 2007 was the progress we made on our major construction projects including our emission reduction effort in Minnesota and our Comanche 3 construction in Colorado. We completed the first stage of the Minnesota effort with the King plant upgrade, while construction of the Comanche 3 project is more than 40% complete. Both projects remain on track and very close to their original budgets. In 2007, we saw an improvement in our credit ratings, despite volatility in the credit enhancing markets. Credit quality, strong balance sheet and conservative financial management have always been important to us even when they were in vogue. Today those qualities are critical. Last September S&P upgraded the credit ratings of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries by one notch citing our strengthening business profile and support of regulation in our key states as the basis for the upgrade. Of course financing is more difficult in the current environment, for that reason I am pleased to say we completed a very successful issuance of $400 million retail hybrid security that receives partial equity treatment from the rating agencies. The timing, structure, and size of the deal gives us great flexibility in 2008 and keeps us on track to execute our financing plan. In spite of the slow down in the national housing market and the potential for a recession, we continue to forecast sales electric growth of 1.8% to 2.2% in 2008. We are fortunate to have a economic diversity across our service territories. For example, we have experienced growth in the energy and agricultural sectors that offsets the slowdown in the general economy. In summary, 2007 was another outstanding year. In addition to delivering earnings results above the high-end of our guidance range and increasing the dividend. Xcel Energy enjoyed many successes during the year that position the company for continued profitable growth in 2008 and beyond. We continue to protect long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% and we are reaffirming our 2008 earnings guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. With that let's open it up for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Hi, thank you. Congratulations and I just was wondering, have most of the plans and RFPs that you have already started considering your Phase II of the construction program, is that agreed upon by all jurisdictions already and do you anticipate to actually recover those cost in the same way you have recovered the first series of projects?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, yes. The twist… you are referring to the RFPs that with wind generation, Daniele?
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Right.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, well, we do expect favorable recovery. In the past, most of that wind generation was recovered through capacity cost recovery and since we are now looking at ownership it will be a different recovery mechanism. In Minnesota that’s a forward-looking rider recovery. The RFP has been issued; we received a good response to that. It is very similar to… the recovery by the way is very similar to the CapEx 20-20 program. And in Colorado where the RFP is yet be issued we expect it will come out the first half of this year. That recovery will be based upon legislation that was passed that encourages the Commission to give us favorable recovery similar to recovery that we have already received for transmission in Colorado, does that help you?
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Yes, it does. And in terms of the next to recover the complete cost of the coal plant of Comanche 3, when do you think that this major rate case will come through?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, our plans right now are to file a rate case in Colorado this year. We will look forward test here. We already have established Daniele that for the coal plant, QUIP [ph] was recovered on a forward-looking basis when we follow general rate case. So, we already know how we will receive that recovery when we file the rate case and then we will also look for forward recovery on the other capital expenditures that we are making, that are not already covered by some form of enhanced recovery.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Will the plant almost be completely recovered by the time you get the rate increase or will you need another…?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it will be very, very close because on a forward basis that would take you through '09 and that's about when the plant comes online.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment, please go ahead sir.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Dan.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Hi good morning. First of all, I was just wondering if you could comment on, you mentioned a little bit that you're seeing some favorable results in energy and agricultural sectors, I was wondering if you could talk about if you're seeing anything else from the economic slowdown we are seeing in the nationwide economy in your service areas?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Dan we are seeing some slowdown particularly on the residential, on the construction sectors, lower housing starts, that sort of thing but by and large the slack created there has been taken out by the energy sector, it's very strong and at SPS it is very strong, at PSCo, agricultural sector is very strong in Minnesota. We are also seeing I think perhaps because of the weaker dollar more increases in some of our larger C&I customers related to exports, paper mills for example which are not an insignificant business within the NSP region. So that seems to be taking up that slack. We are fortunate, as I mention in our prepared remarks that we really do have a lot of economic diversity across our service territories and we have good economies. Many Fortune 500 companies for example up here in Minnesota that I think that are… that create nice diverse C&I class for us. Now all of that said, we will continue to monitor sales as we always do as a nation and we are no exception to that, see how the recession may or may not play out.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, also I was wondering, I haven’t had the chance to go all the way through the release, so may be it's in there but did you lay out what your CapEx budget is going to be for '08?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We’ve laid that out, previously it is about $2.1 billion. There really hasn't been any change to that Dan since we updated you last on the third quarter and then we had an Analyst Day that basically didn't change anything other than move in 2008, the Fort St. Vrain project from potential CapEx into committed CapEx.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment: Okay, then the last one I was wondering is, you mentioned you did that hybrid financing, what kind of financing do you expect say for the first and for the year? Are you going to need to come to markets again there?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think we have George Tyson, our Treasurer here. Let me… I believe in Xcel is NSP Minnesota. Overall for the year Dan we were looking at about $600 million of debt retirements and probably new issuance is of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. George is NSP-Min, the next one up.
George E. Tyson II - Vice President and Treasurer: Yes that's correct, we plan on doing that prior to the end of the first quarter.
Operator: Thank you and the next question comes from the line of Reza Hatefi with Polygon Investments, please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Reza.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: Thank you Hi, how are you guys?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: I am sorry if I missed this earlier but your current plans are still to sell a Colorado rate case in the summer to be effective in mid '09 and the current… then my second question is I guess how the process is going, may be a little more detail on potentially having a forward test here?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, Rez, first of all I think it is later in the year probably more towards the fourth quarter. The progress… we have been working on this for quite a while now. So we're feeling very comfortable that from a technical data quality perspective we will have what we need there. We’ve had multiple dialogs with the staff regarding their requirements and reasons why our forward test here is so important particularly when you are growing rate base. So not too much new to report there other than I think we just continue to make steady progress and we recognize how important it is and I think the Commission realizes that it is important as well.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: Are you the first and only company that is seeking forward test here in the state?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we are by far the largest utility in the State of Colorado. So I believe we will be the first one to seek that.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: And what has been sort of their commentary in terms of plusses and minuses as far as letting the forward test being the new standard, is it just the fact that they historically haven't used one and does they need to get comfortable with it?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think that is generally the case. We are asking for a change of President but I think there’s very good reasons. We’ve got Scott Wilensky here who is our VP of Regulatory Affairs. I think you met Scott at the Analyst Day. Scott, do you want to add some color to that?
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: I think that is a fair characterization. It's been… it’s a change in precedent; it's not the norm. I mean there has to be confident that the date we provide is accurate given them assurance but it is a reasonable forecast of our costs going forward. That's where we’ve spent a lot of time trying to work with folks on and make sure that they can get comfortable not just with the concept but also with the quality of the data that supports it.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: I appreciate that. Just lastly, in Minnesota the new rates, you’ll file at the beginning of '09 and the new rates will be effective January 1, 2009 interim rates that is?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well yes, that would be the plan but I think the interim rate filings needs to be approved as well, is that correct Scott?
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: Not in Colorado.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think he said Minnesota.
Scott Wilensky - Vice President, Regulatory Affairs: [inaudible]
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: Yes.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Is that right Reza, you were talking about Minnesota?
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: Right, Minnesota.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Rest of the way it works in Minnesota is you make the filing and then 60 days after the filing, rates are eligible to put in place.
Reza Hatefi - Polygon Investments: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Good morning.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Travis.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Hi. Quick question again about these rate cases. If we continue in this period of low interest rate environments that we have been in for the last couple of years what impact do you think that could have on both your outstanding rate cases and future, next year or two rate cases that are you going to file?
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, you know we have been in a low interest rate and environment for several years now and we have had pretty good success getting I think constructive outcomes in our filings. So a low interest rate environment is not something that’s new to us. I think the other thing I would keep in mind specifically this time period which as we all know can change on a dime is the… while the treasury rates are low, the credit spreads are significantly wider than where they have been. So I don't really think there has been much of a change in what the actual corporate kind of rate is. So Travis, you know it's something that if we… if rates continue to fall yes I think that could put some pressure on us but I really have to tell you we've filed rate cases where treasury rates are lot lower than they are now and it will come out pretty good.
Travis Miller - Morningstar: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. Please go ahead.
Benjamin G.S. Fowke III - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, okay. If there’s no further questions I appreciate everybody attending the call. If you do have any questions, do not hesitate to call, Paul and the IR team and they’ll get you some answers. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the Xcel Energy 2007 year-end earnings conference call. You may now disconnect and thank you for using the AT&T teleconferencing.

===== 2007 Q2  (2007-07-25 10:00:00) =====
TRANSCRIPT SPONSOR :
Executives: Benjamin Fowke - CFO and VP   George Tyson - VP and Treasurer   Paul Johnson - Managing Director of IR

Operator: Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Xcel Energy second quarter 2007 conference call. (Operator Instructions)  At this time I’d like to turn the presentation over to the Managing Director of Investor Relations, Paul Johnson. Please go ahead sir. 
Paul Johnson: Thank you and welcome to Xcel Energy’s second quarter earnings release conference call. I’m Paul Johnson, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today is Ben Fowke, Vic President and CFO of Xcel Energy, and several others who are here to help answer your questions. This morning we’re going to discuss our financial results, the proposed COLI settlement, and updates on business developments and regulatory processes. I also want to point out on our web site there are slides that are available.  Please let me remind you that some of the comments we’re about to make contain forward looking statements. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release, and Xcel Energy filings with the FCC. With that I’ll turn it over to Ben. 
Benjamin Fowke: Well thanks Paul and welcome everyone. It’s been an outstanding quarter for Xcel Energy, and we have a long list of accomplishments to prove it. We reached a positive settlement in principle in our COLI dispute with the IRS. We achieved constructive outcomes in our natural gas rate cases in both Colorado and North Dakota. Our King Plant came back into service on schedule, and our other major capital projects remain on track and on budget.  We signed a contract for a wind farm development project in Minnesota, we filed a combined electric and gas rate case in Wisconsin, and last, but not least, our second quarter financial results were outstanding. Year-to-day, we’re on track with our financial plan. I’ll get into more detail in just a moment, but let me start with second quarter results. I’m very pleased to report earnings from continuing operations of $0.29 per share for the second quarter of 2007, which compares with $0.24 per share for the second quarter of 2006.  As I mentioned last quarter, we expected that many of the items that reduced first quarter results would reverse as the year went on. Our strong second quarter indicates that’s exactly what’s happening. Earnings from continuing operations increased by $0.05 per share for the quarter, largely due to higher based electric utility margins, which increased earnings by $0.05 per share, higher short term wholesale and commodity trading margins, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, lower utility O&M expense, which increased earnings by $0.01 per share, and higher natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.01 per share.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, and a higher effective tax rate and other items which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. Now let’s get into the details. Our base retail electric utility margins increased by 36 million for the quarter, largely increased by various rate increases, riders, and sales growth. Electric revenue and margin increased about 26 million from the PSCo electric retail rate case, and 7 million from the MERP rider. Our weather adjusted sales growth was a solid 1.8% for the quarter, contributing 16 million of increased margins.  Our year-to-date weather adjusted sales grew 1.6%, which is in line with our annual guidance range of 1.4-2%. Partially offsetting these margin increases were a reduction in fuel recovery at NSP-Wisconsin, and a negative impact to weather. For more information, please see our earnings release. We also experienced increased margins in our national gas business which increased 9 million during the quarter. The increase here was primarily related to rate increases in Minnesota and North Dakota, and a positive impact from weather. Turning to operating expenses, our second quarter O&M expenses decreased 7 million, or 1. 6% compared with the same period last year.  Now remember that our first quarter 2007 O&M expenses were 6% higher than last year, driven largely by the timing of nuclear refueling outages. At that time, I indicated that we expected O&M expenses to moderate throughout the balance of the year. Our second quarter O&M results reflect lower nuclear outage expenses and lower employee benefit costs. The lower benefit costs are largely due to lower medical costs and accrual adjustments to performance compensation, reflecting changes in our stock price.  Our year-to-date O&M expenses increased 2.2% which is consistent with our annual guidance range of 2-3% increase over last year. As expected, our second quarter depreciation expense increased 11 million, or 5.4%, driven by plant system expansion.  Last month, we filed with the Minnesota commission an amendment to our depreciation petition which may reduce our depreciation expense in 2007. I’ll discuss the impact of this filing in a few moments when I update you on regulatory matters.  As far as income taxes are concerned, we had an effective tax rate of 33.4% for continuing operations in the second quarter of 2007. Compared with an effective tax rate of 21.7% in 2006, the lower effective tax rate in 2006 was due primarily to a tax benefit resulting from a reversal of an allowance for capital loss carry-forwards. The higher tax rate during the second quarter of 2007 reduced earnings by approximately $0.05 per share. As a result of the IRS settlement, and the unwinding of the COLI program, we expect our annual effective tax rate will be in the range of 31-34%. This represents a more normalized effective tax rate. Well that covers our results form continuing operations. Total earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $0.18, compared with $0.24 per share for 2006.  Total earnings for 2007 include the loss of $0.11 per share for discontinuing operations, which reflect the impact for the proposed settlement with the IRS regarding disputes associated with our corporate owned life insurance policies, also known as COLI. Let me take a moment to provide some context to the proposed COLI settlement. After disputing this issue for ten years, we’re pleased to be finalizing this positive resolution. While our facts and circumstances were strong, we recognize that a trial presented significant risk, including appeals that could have dragged this issue on for several more years.  As part of the proposed settlement we agreed to pay approximately 64 million to the IRS in exchange for a full settlement of all the government’s claims of back tax, interest, and potential penalties relating to the COLI plans. In 2002, as a prerequisite to filing our tax refund law suit, we paid approximately 35 million for taxes related to the COLI program. This means our incremental cash payments to the IRS will be approximately 29 million.  Another key aspect of the proposed settlement is that we received a tax free surrender of the COLI policies. As a result, we can, in an efficient manner, unwind the COLI policies and avoid the cost of the program, which average about $0.06 per share annually. Of course, this also means we will no longer enjoy the net benefit of COLI, which provided about $0.05 per share of earnings annually, but is a reasonable compromise to resolve this issue.  We talked to a number of investors following this settlement announcement and received very positive feedback. Investors agreed that the proposed settlement was in the best interest of the company. As a result, one analyst upgraded his recommendation on Xcel energy to a buy. The rating agencies were also supportive of the settlement. In fact Fitch upgraded the credit ratings for PSCo in June, citing constructive regulation, and the proposed settlement of COLI.  Our Board of Directors has already approved the settlement and we are confident that the IRS and the Department of Justice Tax Division will do the same during the third quarter. Well that wraps up our discussion on the quarterly results, now I’d like to talk about some other accomplishments that we think are going to drive future earnings. In June we filed a certificate of need, a site permit application, and a renewable energy rider for the Grand Meadow wind farm, which is our first project in our strategic initiative to expand Xcel Energy’s wind ownership. Grand Meadow is a 100 megawatt wind farm in Minnesota. The renewable energy rider would be effective in January of 2008 and we expect Grand Meadow to be operating by the end of 2008.  In other good news, our construction projects are all on track and very well managed. We continue to make significant progress with our emission reduction effort in Minnesota. We recently brought the King plant back online after significant rehabilitation efforts that included replacing the boiler and steam turbine and adding state-of-the-art air quality control equipment. Our team did a great job managing the project, and we now have a cleaner, more efficient, more reliable King plant back in our fleet.  The other MERP projects are also going well. High Bridge is about 60% complete, and should be online in May of 2008. Riverside is about 10% complete and is scheduled to be online in May of 2009. With significant portions of the project wither completed or under contract, we expect to earn an ROE of about 10.7% on these three projects. In Colorado, Comanche 3 construction is approximately 20% complete. All major contracts are signed and design is about 80% complete. Comanche 3 remains on track and on budget.  Now let’s take a look at our regulatory initiatives, starting with the cases that we’ve resolved. In June, the Colorado Commission approved a natural gas rate increase of about 32 million, compared with our original request of almost 42 million. The Colorado Commission also approved a partial decoupling mechanism, which will allow PSCo recovery of additional revenues going forward, to compensate for a portion of the declining residential use per customer. Also in June, the North Dakota Commission approved a 2.3 million natural gas rate increase, which was based on an authorized ROE at 10.75%. In North Dakota, we have a complete decoupling and a natural gas business, which insulates us from declining use per customer.  Last week in Texas, the Commission ruled on our SPS Electric Rate case, and approved a settlement we reached with various interveners in March. The commission also ruled that the fuel cost allocation associated with the El Paso contract should be based on incremental costs. As a result, there’s approximately 6 million in annual fuel costs that we will not recover through rates. SPS has given notice to El Paso that we intend to terminate the contract based on our regulatory out provision, and we expect a termination will be effective in 2009.  We continue to work on resolving fuel reconciliation issues in New Mexico and with FERC. While there are still some outstanding issues, we’re making progress resolving uncertainties and improving the regulatory environment at SPS. Now, let me touch on some pending rate cases. In Minnesota, we have a natural gas rate increase request of 16.8 million pending before the commission. We have been collecting interim rates since early January. We expect the commission to deliberate on this case in August and issue an order in September. In June, NSP-Wisconsin filed a combined rate case with the Wisconsin Commission, requesting a 67.4 million electric rate increase, and a 5.3 million natural gas increase. We expect the commission to reach a decision during the fourth quarter and final rates to be effective in early 2008.  In the future we expect to file an electric rate case in New Mexico at the end of July with final rates effective in mid 2008. We also plan to file a Colorado electric rate case in the fall of 2007 and we anticipate that final rates would be effective in mid 2008. While it’s too early to discuss the magnitude of this case, I can tell you that the proposed rate case will be based on a forward test year. We are working to familiarize the Colorado Commissions staff with a forward test year filing as we feel it is an important step to reducing regulatory lag.  There’s one last regulatory issue I want to mention. In June, 2007, we filed a request to lengthen the depreciable life for the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years. In addition, the request sought to change the lives of certain other facilities. This filing was part of an annual review of remaining depreciation lives. If the Minnesota Commission approves our request, effective at the beginning of the year, our depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 31 million.  In July, the Department of Commerce filed their comments, which recommended approval of our filing with some minor modifications. The Minnesota Commission is expected to ruling on our filing during the third quarter. So that’s a summary of our regulatory development. When we developed our building the core strategy several years ago, we understood the importance of constructive regulation, and we have worked hard and with success to achieve it. As I have said many times, you have to get the rules right before you embark on a major capital investment program.  I think it’s worth taking a moment to emphasize the progress we’ve made in achieving these goals. I want to talk about the recovery mechanisms we have in our main jurisdictions, which are illustrated in the slides on our website accompanying this call. As you are probably aware we have fuel recovery mechanisms and purchase gas adjustment clauses in all our jurisdictions, with the exception of Wisconsin, which has their perspective adjustments handled by the fuel monitoring process.  Well first let’s look at the outstanding cost recovery instruments we have at NSP-Minnesota, which represents about 47% of our 2006 net income. Minnesota rate filings are based on forward test years with interim rates. Minnesota also has a number of rate riders, which allows for the recovery of cost, and return from investments, without the delay and uncertainty of filing a rate case.  These riders allow for the tiny revenue recovery, and are good mechanisms to recover the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time. The Minnesota riders include the MERP rider, a transmission rider, a mercury reduction and environmental improvement rider, and a conservation improvement program rider, among others. North Dakota and South Dakota, which are part of NSP-Minnesota, also have several of these recovery mechanisms.  In Colorado, which represents about 38% of 2006 net income, we have either implemented or obtained authority for several riders, including a capacity cost rider, a transmission rider, a DSM writer, a renewable energy rider, an air quality improvement rider, any rider to recover IGCC costs if we go forward with this project. In addition, for Comanche 3 we are allowed to earn a forward looking cash return on CWIP when we file a general rate case. We are also allowed to earn on an inequity ratio of 60% to offset the impact of purchase power contracts and the impact of imputed debt.  Finally, the next Colorado rate case will be followed on a forward test here to further reduce regulatory lag. Together, NSP-Minnesota and PSCo provide approximately 85% of our earnings, and as you can see, we have riders or enhanced recovery mechanisms for many of our major capital projects and initiatives at these jurisdictions.  At SPS, which generates roughly 8% of our 2006 net income, we are making strides towards improving a regulatory environment in Texas and in Mexico. For example, under the settlement just approved in Texas, our next rate case will allow for minimum rate recovery of capacity costs from a power purchase contract that starts in June of 2008.  Finally, Wisconsin, which represents about 7% of 2006 net income, we filed rate cases based on forward test years. Historically, Wisconsin has been one of the most constructive state commissions. So with that, I would like to wrap things up. As you can see we’ve had an outstanding second quarter. Based on our solid year-to-date results we are positioned to deliver earnings from continuing operations at either the upper end or exceeding our guidance range of $1.30 - $1.40 per share.  Looking forward, we plan to file our Colorado resource plan at the end of October and the Minnesota resource plan in December. These filings will provide more detail on our environmental and renewable strategy, and will lay out the foundation of our resource plan for the next ten years. To provide more information on those strategic plans we are hosting an analyst meeting in New York City on December 5th. More information will be provided to you in the coming weeks and we really hope to see you there. So with that let’s open it up for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead. 
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Daniele. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Hi. I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions on the CapEx. Can you give us an idea of the estimates on the costs of the wind farm? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yea, the wind farm will be approximately 210 million Daniele. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay, and could you remind us of the total CapEx for this year and next year? 
 Benjamin Fowke : It’s about 1.9 billion. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: And same thing for both years? 
 Benjamin Fowke : I’m sorry, what? 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Same for both years? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yea, I’m sorry that’s about the number for both years. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Ok, great and when do you anticipate, what are you thinking of, in terms of schedule on the IGCC at this time? 
 Benjamin Fowke : What we are planning to do is present it as an option for the commission to review when we file our least cost plan, our resource plan, in Colorado in the fall of this year Daniele. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay, and assuming that it takes a year for the decision to be made, would you start immediately at that point or is there some lead times, approximate dates you are thinking you could build it for? 
 Benjamin Fowke : I’m sorry Daniele, yeah, there are certainly lead times. The next step in the process, in addition to filing as an option, is to then do the feed study, which will take us into next year. Then we will understand if the project’s approved or not, and we’ll go forward. And if the project were to go forward I think you’re looking at the 2013-2014 timeframe, correct me if I’m wrong. 
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Thanks, appreciate. 
 Benjamin Fowke : Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Paul Ridzon with Key Bank. Please go ahead. 
 Benjamin Fowke : Hey Paul. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: How are you? Congratulations on the quarter. I had a couple of questions. You threw out a $31 million number, potential nuclear depreciation decrease. Is that for ’07 or is that on a four year basis? 
 Benjamin Fowke : No, that number assumes that the commission approves it and follows the past present of putting it all the way back at the beginning of January 2007. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: And would we see a revenue requirement decrease offsetting that, or would that drop to the bottom line? 
 Benjamin Fowke : You would see a revenue requirement decrease when we filed a rate case. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: So you keep the cash until the next rate case? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yes. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: And what’s the magnitude of under recovery due to regulatory lag in Colorado that you’re currently experiencing? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Well it’s a historic test here Paul so as you know, as you start to spend more than your depreciation, rate based lag becomes pretty significant. I mean, it depends on a number of factors, but once you get beyond that level that I mentioned, you can see lag eating away returns at about 100 basic points a year. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: And how much of the drop in O&M was a mark on pension stock? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Well, employee benefits I believe reduced O&M for the quarter by about 12million,and that ass driven by both medical and I think it was fairly balanced medical and performance based comp. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: And then, just lastly, you mentioned the release at trading results, there was some impact from NSP-Minnesota entering into a wholesales margin settlement agreement, which kind of out of period, how much was that? 
 Benjamin Fowke : I think you’re referring to what we entered into last year. Is that what you’re talking about? I mean last year, remember, as we were filing the retail rate case, we entered into, as part of the settlement, an agreement to share those margins pretty significantly, and that was reflected in the second quarter of 2006. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: Okay, so we’ve already cycled through a full year of that? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yep. 
Paul Ridzon - Key Bank: Okay, those were my questions, thank you. 
 Benjamin Fowke : Thanks Paul. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question will come from the line of Charles Fishman with A.G. Edwards. Please go ahead. 
Charles Fishman - AG. Edwards: Charles, good morning. Capacity cost projection for the full year decreased about 10 million? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yes. 
Charles Fishman - AG. Edwards: What’s driving that? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Basically, as we actually went through the process of contracting for purchase power, we did a better job in getting that power that we had originally anticipated. 
Charles Fishman - AG. Edwards: Do you have any - as far as we look towards 2008, will we see a increase in the range of 25 million again? Would that be your best guess at this point. I mean, will this be ongoing? 
 Benjamin Fowke: We’re always going to have some capacity calls, Charles, but I think the range is yet to be determined. One thing to keep in mind is that as SPS, we will have the ability to bring the lead power contract and start recovering that on an interim basis, provided we then follow our rate case, which we’re planning to do. 
Charles Fishman - AG. Edwards: Okay. And then in Colorado you certainly expressed more confidence in this forward test than in the past. I mean, has something transpired recently that makes you talk more favorably? 
 Benjamin Fowke: Well I think we’ve got a constructive regulatory environment there, and I think we’re working hard to prepare for, not only internally, but also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks get the staff prepared on what a forward test filing looks like and what their concerns and what they’re going to need to see. And so it’s a focus of ours, and I think if past success is any indicator we will be successful there. We are putting a lot of effort into it Charles. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Ok, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. 
 Benjamin Fowke : Hi Dan. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Hi how are you? Just a couple of things, first of all, kind of related to the depreciation extension related to Monticello. Has that plan already received NRC approval for license extension? 
 Benjamin Fowke : Yes, that happened last year. 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : How about Prairie Island? Is that part of this process as well? 
 Benjamin Fowke : That is further behind in the curve. That’s an ’08 item. 
 Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Ok, so would you expect probably another change in the appreciation related to when you last got an extension approval for that? 
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, I mean I think that remains to be seen, but that’s a logical assumption. 
 Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : I’m just curious on the industrial sales if you know what you’re seeing there. Not adjusted for weather, they look like they were somewhat weak. What are you seeing in your service territory as far as industrial demand? 
Benjamin Fowke: Well, what we’re seeing is last year we started to see, and we reported on, a bit of an economic slowdown on the C and I side, Commercial and Industrial side, particularly in Minnesota, but the trend seems to be improving as of late. And that’s what you’re starting to see reflected in the stronger sales growth that we reported this quarter, Dan. 
 Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Ok, and then the last thing I’m wondering is, as far as there being a lot of construction going on, what do you see as your capital needs? For the second half of the year, do you expect to have to raise any new money, or what’re your plans there? 
Benjamin Fowke: Well, we’ve outlaid the financing plans in the press release. I guess the big item is we are planning to do a hybrid instrument at the holding company later this year, looking at a range of about 500 million, but no unexpected surprises. 
 Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, our next question will come from Ashar Khan at SAC Capital. Please go ahead. 
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Good morning. 
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Ashar. 
 Ashar Khan - SAC Capital : Hey Ben, if I understand, if this depreciation order goes through, that will be an improvement in earnings of around $0.05 or so, right? 
Benjamin Fowke: Probably more like $0.04, but yes. 
 Ashar Khan - SAC Capital : And then I just wanted to go over the financing. Is there opportunity to do more of hybrid beyond the 500? I’m just trying to see going forward how you plan to meet the gap. Is there more room at the parent to do hybrid in your capital structure? 
Benjamin Fowke: George, do you want to comment? George Tyson is here, I’ll let him comment. 
George Tyson: I think before we definitely want to conclude that we’d like to have the first issuance done. As Ben said, we’re targeting a size of around 500 million. I think if you look at the percentage of hybrid securities that can be accommodated in a capital structure, we think we can go to a higher lever, but we’d really like to complete this initial issuance to determine the market depth and reception for us. But it is a possibility. We could look for greater capacity after this year. 
 Ashar Khan - SAC Capital : Ok great, and then Ben, could you just mention which forward test year are you going to be looking for in the Colorado filing? Is it going to be full year 2008? Is that what the aim is? 
Benjamin Fowke: Yes. 
 Ashar Khan - SAC Capital : OK, thank you very much. 
Benjamin Fowke: Thanks Ashar. 
Operator: At this time we have no additional questions in the queue and I’d like to turn the conference over to you for any closing remarks. 
Benjamin Fowke: No, I appreciate everybody’s participation in the call. If you any follow-up questions, please feel free to give Paul Johnson in the IR team a call. Thanks to everyone. 
Operator: Thank you management. (Operator Instructions).

Ben Fowke: Well, thanks, Paul, and welcome everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2006 earnings from continuing operations came in at the top of our guidance range at $1.35 per share as compared to the $1.20 per share for 2005. Total earnings for 2006 which include the impact of discontinued operations were $1.36 per share compared with a $1.23 per share for 2005.  In 2006, we had $0.01 of earnings from discontinued operations due to a true-up of reserves for cost estimates for various asset sales. While in 2005, we had $0.03 of earnings from discontinued operations for tax benefits related to the divestiture of NRG.  Our earnings from continuing operations increased by $0.15 per share for the year largely due to higher electric retail margins, which increased earnings by $0.33 per share, higher natural gas margins which increased earnings by about $0.04 per share and other items that together increased earnings by about $0.01 per share. These positive factors were partially offset by higher utility O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.09 per share, higher depreciation expense, which decreased earnings by $0.08 per share, and lower short-term wholesale margins which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share.  That summarizes the year-end results. So, now let's look into the details. Our base retail electric utility margins increased by $226 million or $0.33 per share for the year, largely driven by rate increases and sales growth. Electric margin grew by $208 million from various rate increases. This includes $129 million from the rate increase in Minnesota, $38 million from the MERP rider and $41 million for an electric rate increase in Wisconsin. For the year, our weather adjusted electric retail sales growth was a solid 1.8%, which increased electric margin by $39 million. Offsetting these positive drivers were several items that reduced electric margin.  The first item was a $26 million transmission fee reclassification, which moves certain expenses from O&M into cost of sales. While this reclassification has had no impact on net income, it does create a deviation in both electric margin and O&M expense.  The second item was a $20 million decline in the PSCo Electric Commodity Adjustment incentive or the ECA. The ECA is both a cost recovery and an incentive mechanism in Colorado, which provides for a cap on any cost or benefit of approximately $11 million. We experienced an $11 million cost in 2006, while we recognized an ECA benefit of approximately $9 million in 2005. The ECA did expire at the end of 2006 and has been replaced with a more traditional cost recovery mechanism.  Finally, certain reserves recorded for regulatory issues at SPS negatively affected electric margins. These reserves generally related to disputes regarding the use of system average fuel costs versus incremental costs. At this time, we feel we recorded the appropriate level of reserves for these issues. For more information on electric margins, please refer to the margin table on our earnings release.  As expected, short-term wholesale margins declined by $44 million. The decline in margins reflects the implementation of customer care mechanisms, normal retail sales, customer demand growth which reduces our surplus generation available for sales, and a reduction in the availability of the coal-fired King plant due to the MERP project.  Now turning to operating expenses. Operating expenses increased approximately $64 million or 3.8% in 2006, largely driven by higher employee benefit costs, which are primarily performance-based, and higher nuclear and combustion plant costs. These higher costs were partially offset by the reclassification of transmission fees, the establishment of a regulatory asset for Private Fuel Storage costs, and gains on the disposal of certain assets.  Moving on, depreciation expense increased $55 million or 7.1% in 2006, driven by increased capital spending and changes in decommissioning accruals.  Finally, let me touch on taxes. In 2006, we recognized tax benefits of about $30 million related to the utilization of capital loss carry-forwards and the reversal of a regulatory reserve. In 2005, we recognized approximately $10 million of tax benefits that were one-time in nature. So, that's a more detailed look at 2006 results. Next, I'd like to provide a regulatory recap.  Let's begin with the cases that we concluded in 2006. We reached constructive conclusions in our rate cases in both Colorado and Minnesota. The Minnesota decision increased rates in 2006, while the Colorado case will increase rates in 2007. These decisions provide us with regulatory certainty in our major jurisdictions. We also filed several cases in 2006 that will have impact in 2007.  In Minnesota, we requested an increase of $18.5 million, interim rates subject to refund were set at $15.9 million and went into effect on January 8.  In Colorado, we requested an increase of $41.5 million, Colorado doesn't have interim rates. However, we expect final rates to go into effect in the third quarter.  In North Dakota, we requested an increase of $2.8 million and we expect interim rates will be in place in early 2007. All three of these gas cases should be decided later this summer. We also have a pending rate case in Texas, where we're seeking an electric rate increase of $48 million. In addition to the rate case, our 2004 through 2005 fuel reconciliation is being considered under the same docket, and most recently filed recommendations.  In the base rate case, the recommendations range from a decrease of $56 million to a rate increase of $31 million, while recommendations without as a fuel reconciliation has earnings from disallowance of $8 million to a disallowance of $120 million. We just filed our rebuttal testimony and hearings are expected to be held in February.  Final rates are expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2007. Looking ahead, later this spring, we will file our electric and natural gas rate cases in Wisconsin as required by law. Rates related to the Wisconsin cases will go into effect in 2008.  That summarizes our regulatory developments. I think you'll agree with me that 2006 was a positive and productive year on a regulatory front. As a result of a constructive regulatory environment in our major jurisdictions, we are expanding on building the core strategy. There are several projects that we are proposing that were not included in the capital expenditure forecast we published in the third quarter of 2006.  The most significant project is an upgrade of our Sherco coal-fired plant in Minnesota. We're proposing to add 140 megawatts of capacity and reduced emissions by upgrading the environmental systems. This effort is similar to the MERP project at our King plant. The preliminary cost estimate is $900 million. With commission approval, construction would start in late 2008 and finish in 2012. We will file for a right of recovery mechanism in September and expect the Minnesota Commission to rule on the proposal in 2008.  Next, as you are probably aware, we are the largest retail provider of wind energy in the United States, in part because our service territory sits in the middle of [wind valley]. We currently have about 1,300 megawatts of wind generation on our system. By the end of 2007, we expect to have 2,800 megawatts under contract. For the most part, [this is all the] wind we can generate, as all of the 25 megawatts of this generation is procured through power purchase agreements.  However, we are proposing to spend $210 million to build a 100-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota. If approved, we would expect to complete the project in 2009. This investment will be recovered through a renewable rider in Minnesota. Because of our environmental leadership, we are well-positioned to meet the various renewable energy standards being proposed by the states in our service territories. These standards also present us with investment opportunities for wind generation and also transmission. We think owning wind generation fits well into our building the core strategy.  Finally, we are proposing to develop a new natural gas transmission pipeline and storage system in Colorado through our WYCO partnership. The project will be regulated by FERC and is expected to go into commercial operation in 2009. We plan to invest approximately $145 million into WYCO over the next few years. WYCO will provide additional gas storage for our PSCo operations and will provide a real benefit to our customers. These new projects I just discussed all come with good regulatory recovery and will help to meet our customer needs, while increasing earnings for our shareholders well into the next decade.  In summary, 2006 was an outstanding year. Our construction projects at both Comanche 3 and MERP remain on track with cost inline with our expectations. Construction on the King plant is now more than 85% complete and the plant will come back online this spring. Our nuclear and fossil plants performed extremely well in 2006. In fact, our Monticello nuclear plant ran for 637 days stay, which set a new record for continuous operations at Xcel Energy. As you might have heard, the plant recently came back online after a minor forced [shutdown].  We improved (inaudible) of 99.5 minutes in 2005 to 79.2 minutes in 2006 which represents upper quartile performance. We reached constructive resolutions in our rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, and Wisconsin. We delivered outstanding earnings results in 2006. We've positioned ourselves for a strong 2007, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for continuing operations of $1.35 to $1.45 per share.  And finally, we are expanding our capital expenditure program to meet customer needs and to provide sustainable earnings growth into the next decade. So with that, let's open it up for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question will come from the line of Charles Fishman with A.G. Edwards. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Good morning. If I take the last capital expenditure forecast, which was about 1.5 billion per year, I think, '08 through 2010. Can I just elaborate this new -- these new investment projects? I mean, obviously assuming they're approved, roughly during at that time period? 
Ben Fowke: Yeah, well remember -- we can, Charles. Remember the Sherco upgrade in environmental retrofitting, the construction will go through 2012. So you've got to take it a little further out. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Okay. Now, I guess obviously that's my next question, as far as the financing, are you still thinking equity-wise, just the drip is all you're going to need? 
Ben Fowke: Yeah, at this point, Charles, we haven't changed our financing plans. We obviously have to continue to assess and monitor that going forward, but while these projects are significant capital investments and they will drive earnings. When you do remodeling you'll see that they start to come on as some of our other capital expenditures start to wind-down from the MERP and Comanche 3 project. And they also come with I think very good recovery mechanism, so no change at this point. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Yeah. On the wind project, what is the advantage for doing a BOT-type structure versus just -- it's just a bit higher for you to eventually have ownership in the wind instead of just power [technical difficulty] 
Ben Fowke: Of resource. The fact that we haven't own in the past, I think just probably a number of reasons, but we certainly want to change that going forward and rebalance. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Okay. And the reasons in the past have been more your own as opposed to regulatory? 
Ben Fowke: I think it's probably just been because it hasn't, until recently, been a significant part of the portfolio and it certainly looks like it's going to be a much more significant part of the portfolio going forward. And we think it's important we have an ownership element there. 
Charles Fishman - A.G. Edwards: Okay. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Coviello with Duquesne Capital. 
Ben Fowke: Hi, Jeff. 
Operator: Jeff, your line is open, please proceed. 
Ben Fowke: Operator, we might be having some problems with the sound quality. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And at this time there are no further questions. 
Ben Fowke: Okay. I apologize for the participants on the call if we've had sound quality issues. Hopefully that's not the case, but I think there might be some issues. I want to thank everybody for participating on our call this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, Paul Johnson will be available to take your calls. Look forward to working with all of you, as we look towards another great year in '07. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Xcel Energy fourth quarter 2006 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, my name is Michael and I would be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xcel Energy Q3 2006 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you, I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Kolkmann. Sir, you may begin.
Richard Kolkmann - Managing Director of IR: Thanks Michael, and welcome to Xcel Energy's Q3 2006 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Dick Kolkmann, Managing Director of Investor Relations, and with me is Ben Fowke, Vice President and CFO of Xcel Energy. We also have several others here in the room to help provide answers to your questions. Some of the comments that will be made contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and Xcel Energy’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I will turn the call over to Ben.
 Benjamin Fowke - Chief Financial Officer and VP: Thanks Dick and welcome everyone. I’m pleased to report that for the Q3 in a row we delivered strong earnings results. Today, I will cover the quarter, the outlook for the balance of the year, our regulatory progress and finally some additional detail on our 2007 guidance. So let’s start with the quarter. Xcel Energy recorded earnings from continuing operations of $0.53 per share for Q3 of 2006. This compares with $0.47 per share for Q3 of 2005. Earnings from continuing operations equal total earnings for both Q3 of 2006 and 2005. Our earnings from continuing operations increased by $0.06 per share for the quarter largely due to higher electric retail margins which increased earnings by $0.08 per share, higher gas margins which increased earnings by $0.02 per share and other items that together increased earnings by about $0.01 per share. These positive factors were partially offset by higher utility O&M expenses which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher depreciation expense which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. That summarizes Q3 results. Now let’s look into the details. Our base retail electric utility margins increased by $57 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter, largely driven by rate increases and sales growth. Electric margin grew by $66 million from various rate increases; this includes $35 million from the interim rate increase in Minnesota, $11 million for the implementation of the MERP rider and $20 million for the electric rate increase in Wisconsin. For the quarter our weather adjusted electric retail sales growth was a solid 2.3% which increased the electric margin by $15 million. On a year-to-date basis our weather adjusted sales growth was 2%.  While we experienced warmer than normal temperatures during the quarter, we had similar weather during Q3 2005, as a result weather had a minimal impact on our quarterly comparison. Partially offsetting these positive items was a reclassification of transmission expenses, which reduce the electric margin by $21 million. The reclassification didn’t impact net income it just moved some transmission expenses from O&M to electric cost of good sold. Electric margin for the quarter also declined by $17 million for the electric commodity adjustment incentive or the ECA. As we discussed in the past the ECA is both a cost recovery and an incentive mechanism in Colorado that provides for $11.25 million cap on any cost or benefit. In 2005 the ECA was positive while year-to-date results reflect a cost of $11.25 million. The ECA expires in 2006 and is expected to be replaced with a more traditional cost recovery mechanism. For more information on electric margin please refer to the margin table in our earnings release. Turning to operating expenses, our Q3 O&M expenses increased approximately $10 million or 2.6% driven largely by employee benefit cost. For the full year we expect our O&M expense to increase about 4% over last year. As was the case last year we benefited from additional margin from warmer than normal summer temperatures. As a result, we decided to spend additional O&M to ensure the system stays in good shape and is ready to go in 2007. Our Q3 depreciation expense increased $19 million or 9.9%, driven by increased capital spending and changes in decommissioning accruals. That raps up the explanation of the quarterly results. It’s been a busy quarter on a regulatory front so let me update you on our progress. I will start in the north and work my way south. In September the Minnesota Commission issued an order granting us electric revenue increase of approximately $131 million based on an authorized ROE of 10.54%. We had requested an electric rate increase of $156 million. While we had asked for reconsideration of few items overall, we think the decision represent a constructive regulatory outcome. In Colorado, we request an electric rate increase of $208 million.  The request was based on an 11% ROE and equity ratio of almost 60% and a rate base of $3.4 billion. While the case is based on 2005 historic test year the filing is adjusted for known and measurable changes. I am pleased to report that we reached a definitive settlement agreement with several interveners in the Colorado rate case including the commission staff and the office of Consumer Council. The settlement reflects a rate increase of $151 million, which represents a base rate increase of $107 million and rider recovery of $44 million related to capacity and wind source cost. The settlement is based on an authorized ROE of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 60%. The settlement is pending approval by the Colorado Commission, while we didn’t get everything we asked for the agreement represents another example of constructive regulation in our major jurisdictions. We have asked the commission to hold hearings to rule on this settlement in November and requested that final rates go into effect in January 2007. In taxes, we have requested an electric rate increase of $48 million. Based on an ROE of 11.6% and an historic test year with an equity ratio of 51% and a rate base of $943 million. In September we filed corrections to the case which increased the request to $63 million. However, to establish new rates as quickly as possible, we didn’t re-file the entire case. As a result we are limited to the $48 million increase originally requested. Final rates are now expected to be effective in the Q2 2007. Well, that’s an update on our regulatory developments; I think you’ll agree with me that it’s been a productive quarter with positive conclusion in our Minnesota rate case and a pending settlement on our Colorado rate case. Now I like to discuss earnings guidance to both 2006 and 2007. We have delivered three solid quarters this year. In addition we’ve reached a constructive conclusion in our Minnesota electric case and we recognize some tax benefits and our sales have increased due to favorable temperatures. As a result we believe we are well positioned to achieve annual earnings in the upper half of our 2006 guidance range of $25 to $35 per share. That said, we do need to monitor regulatory proceedings at SPS. As we discussed in our SEC filings we have several complaints at SPS related to cost allocations involving the use of system average cost versus incremental fuel cost. But we believe our arguments have strong merits, there is always uncertainty in regulatory proceedings. We have accrued approximately $15 million which we believe is the appropriate reserve for these complaints. However, I want to point out to you that our guidance for both 2006 and 2007 assumes no additional material accruals for exposure at the SPS regulatory proceeding. For more information please review our 2006 key assumptions which are listed in the earnings release. Turning to next year, we are initiating 2007 earnings guidance of a $35 to $45 per share. Last year at the fall EEI financial conference we increased our earnings growth objective to 5% to 7% from a base of 2005 actual results. The EPS growth objective was based on our capital investment and regulatory recovery plans. As you look at our guidance for 2006 and 2007 you will see that our projected results are consistent with our EPS growth objective. Further as a result of the pending settlement in the Colorado electric rate case, we go into 2007 with more regulatory certainty. On the highlight of few key assumptions for our 2007 earnings guidance, we assume normal weather conditions throughout the year. Our guidance assumes reasonable regulatory recovery in our various rate cases and that the Colorado commission approves our electric rate case settlement. We expect our electric sales will grow 1.7% to 2.2% on a weather adjusted basis. As I discussed earlier we don’t expect any additional material accruals for regulatory proceedings at SPS and finally our guidance assumes that we continue to recognize fully tax benefits. Well, those were the highlights, for more information please refer to our earnings release where we detail our assumptions for most lines of the income statement. Included in the earnings release is our updated capital expenditure forecast. As a key component to our strategy is getting the rules right before we invest the capital. It is clear that the commissions and regulatory staff in our major jurisdictions recognize that there is a need for significant investment and had worked with us to ensure the appropriate regulatory treatment. This has validated our business strategy. As a result we have increased our capital expenditure forecast. These investments will meet customer needs and provide us with sustainable earnings growth into the next decade. Well, we have given you a fair amount of detail by year you should be aware that this CapEx forecast is not written in stone, we will continue to evaluate the forecast based on our financial results, changing customer needs, potential investment opportunities, regulatory recovery and other conditions. We plan to finance the capital expenditure program to a combination of cash from operations, utilization of our net operating tax laws, carry forward the dividend reinvestment program and the assurance of debt and potentially a hybrid security. As a result of constructive regulatory outcomes, we believe we can fund our capital program and elaborate the balance sheet over time without the need for a public equity issuance beyond our normal dividend reinvestment program. Now just as our capital investment program is not set in stone neither is our financing plan. We will modify our plan based on changes to the capital expenditure forecast, changes in cash generation, outcomes in various regulatory proceedings, and our desire to improve our credit ratings. In summary, this has been an outstanding quarter. We have reached a constructive resolution in our rate case in Minnesota and a positive settlement with parties in Colorado. Our construction program remains on track. We delivered another strong quarter of earnings results. We positioned ourselves for a strong 2007 and finally we have expanded our capital expenditure program to meet customer needs and provide sustainable earnings growth into the next decade. So with that let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Greg Gordon with Citigroup.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thanks good morning.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: I know this is like a broken record this question already but -- when if that all are we going to have any visibility on resolution also the extent uncertainty on the Coley tax issue?
Benjamin Fowke: Greg, on the holding?
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Yeah, when do we potentially going to get more visibility on the resolution of the uncertainty around the Coley?
Benjamin Fowke: Oh, the Coley, well we have been told to be trial ready in the beginning of 2007, so if you make -- if that implies our trial will commence in the early part of 2007 and if it does, I think it’s about six day, week process. So, hopefully we will have an answer for you before Q1 of 2007, we are also still waiting Greg to here on our motion for some re-judgment that was heard several weeks ago.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, now I’m looking at my old capital expenditure forecast in my model and I’m going to concede I may not be perfectly updated but this new CapEx budget looks higher. I’m just wondering can you give us an updated, sort of projection on what rate base looks like over the next several years like you provide in some of your analyst percentages.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, rate bases -- continue to grow about by 5% annually that the changes Greg from the last capital forecast to primarily in the area of nuclear expenditures. We are planning to upgrade our units to add another 250 megawatts of capacity. You’ll see more transmission investment primarily around the CapEx 2020 program that’s in the latter half of the decade. And all embedded in the base capital assumptions towards the latter part of the decade is some upgrading at our share goal plans in Minnesota.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: The nuclear plants that you plan on spending capital order in which regulated jurisdictions?
Benjamin Fowke: Minnesota
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Minnesota, so they wouldn’t fall under the MERP if you increase the capital base in those assets you would have to file a separate proceeding to get the recovery.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, there is two ways we get recovery, one through jurisdictional rate cases, which in Minnesota are forward test years, but what we are planning to do next year is work with our commission to try to put together an enhanced recovery method as we have done in with other capital expenditure programs.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, so when I look at this 160 ramping to 180, ramping to 250 and nuclear capacity life extension there is going to be some sort of future process to try to get recovery of those expenditures.
Benjamin Fowke: That’s the plan Greg.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: And then the 2020 program, recoveries of those capital expenditures, that revenue requirement will be granted at the first level, is that right?
Benjamin Fowke: Now, that’s the CapEx 2020 program is administered by the state and it’s a forward looking rider method similar to what we have in MERP.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, thanks guys.
Benjamin Fowke: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Hi, just a quick question, when do you anticipate to file in Minnesota again?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, on the GAAP side, Daniele we will probably file in November of the this year, on the electric side I don’t think we have a data this point, I mean we will continue to monitor, of the -- our results but at this point there is no set determination of when we would file another electric case.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: So what of the discussions you are going to have with the Minnesota Commission regarding future complexion (inaudible) any case.
Benjamin Fowke: You are referring to the upgrade program I mentioned, yes that would be separate.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski with HSBC.
Angie Storozynski - HSBC: Good morning, I have one question about your assumptions. I am looking at the weather adjusted retail of electric sales gross and the natural gas sales gross and I see it that now you are projecting that’s going to be between 1.7% and 2.1% for 2007, it seems much higher than at least what I anticipated, then the -- I just want to know if you see any change in the region and the regional economy that drives the sales grow higher and also for a natural gas sales, I see that now we are assuming of the climb between 1% and 2% and as far as I remember previously we assumed that they are going to be almost flats. So can I get a comment on that?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, it’s really adjusted consistent with the pattern that we saw in this year in ‘06 and we are just extending those into ’07. This year will be on the electric side around 2%, on the GAAP side it will be slightly declining. We think those trends will continue in to ‘07.
Angie Storozynski - HSBC: Regarding natural gas sales, do you thing its some sort of conservation measures and do you think that, with supposedly lower natural gas prices do you think that this trends might be reversed.
Benjamin Fowke: It’s certainly something we will look at, but gas prices are still relatively high. If you look at it on historic basis and customers are more aware of their gas bills, more energy efficient appliances are being installed so, I mean that’s the trend we see. It’s the reason when we file rate cases that we are looking for more fixed recovery. Also we don’t have as much exposure to either weather or declining sales usage.
Angie Storozynski - HSBC: Right and just one more question, how about the higher operating and maintenance expense, if I understand that this quarter you guys basically invested more to ensure reliability of the service. However, when I look at the nine month numbers, we are up almost 4%. Is that when I see the guidance that between 3% and a 4% growth, then on that expenses. Why do we see that this gross, what drives the higher costs?
Benjamin Fowke: There is a couple of things, there is two nuclear outages this year contributed to the expenses. We are seeing higher employee benefit costs in general, some increases in expenses. Next year our guidance is set for O&M to increase 2% to 3% from our ‘06 levels. So we’ll see a tail off a bit from what we experienced this year. The bottom line is we are making sure that our operating system is given adequate O&Ms that we can have reliable service and we have been pretty successful at that.
Angie Storozynski - HSBC: Okay thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg (inaudible) with Lehman Brothers.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Craig.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, how are you doing?
Benjamin Fowke: Good.
Unidentified Analyst: Two topics, the first I wanted to follow up on the accruals for the SPS case, so I was just wondering if you could provide any detail on the -- items in the $15 million that you have accrued for and then the other topic is -- just confirm the size of the drip and potential timing of a hybrid issuance.
Benjamin Fowke: Okay, let me -- the drip, the drip typically adds about $40 million a year, so about $2 million shares or something like that. The time you have the hybrid security with -- I mean it’s -- it will depend, but we are forward looking at late to 2007, 2008 time frame for that. Was your first question related to the SPS situation?
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah.
Benjamin Fowke: And specifically what did you want to know Greg?
Unidentified Analyst: More detail on the accruals, just what they are related to.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, just by examining the compliance and the merits of the compliance we have established the $50 million reserved its --there are several different compliance all at the same average versus incremental fuel cost, and that’s where we think covers it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBank.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Paul.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBank: Good morning, how are you?
Benjamin Fowke: Good.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBank: I think you upped your wholesale outlook for the year, just kind of wondering what drove that and then secondly, you had on the tax line, looks like a $0.2 to $0.3 reserve reversal. Just wondering when you put that reserve on, whether that was in ‘06 or for prior periods.
Benjamin Fowke: I will answer your last questions first, the tax reserve is just been over a period of time with and we haven’t filed a rate case is Minnesota for, I guess it’s been 12 years. So it was over a long period of time and that we were able to release that as we went through the right case and resolve some open issues. I forgot your first question?
Paul Ridzon - KeyBank: What shows the higher, you have your wholesale outlook this winter?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, well basically it just based upon results year to-date. We had some positive items in the proprietary side of our trading business, can’t count on that going forward but given year to-date levels it position us to on the higher end of the guidance from that.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBank: And step down next to your is just expected, you won’t have such positive results next year?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, well there is two big factors, the biggest one is the fact that is under the Colorado settlement and the Minnesota order we’ve agreed to share much of a percentage of our trading margins coming off of our generation stack that we had in the past that combine growing retail low is the reason why see a decline in trading margins.
Paul Ridzon - KeyBank: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities
Benjamin Fowke: Hi Nathan
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Good morning, I wanted to follow up on the accrual of the -- will that $15 million would that fall into this quarter?
Benjamin Fowke: I think it’s been over two quarters. Teresa is that right? Okay, half and half Nathan.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Okay great, also in the ONM recorded that your higher employee benefit cost is primarily performance basis it was negative $21 million impact. Could you quantify how much that was performance base?
Benjamin Fowke: The majority of it was in its -- a number different programs. The biggest driver was the short-term annual incentive as we look to be on upper end our earnings guidance range that means from incentive cost build-up. There was also some increases, Nathan on some longer return incentive related to the good performance that our stock exchange.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: I see. Okay so looking forward in your expectation for 2007 would you expect that that kind of level to continue or is it more of a one time item?
Benjamin Fowke: I don’t think you would have the same level. I like to see it continue because that would mean that we are going very well, but it would be based around performance.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: I understand, and based on 2007 levels what we -- if you were to achieve similar type of appreciation in your stock and see similar type of earning performance would it be similar type of impact for performance bank?
Benjamin Fowke: Jeez, but I think what you are seeing this year when you add to $21 million as an incentive program all in that and probably be pushing close to $35 million to $40 million and that is not what we would -- when we go into the next year the number would be roughly be say $10 million lower. So you had would see -- if the performance is on the upper-end and you might see some there, but Nathan that all depends on -- there is a lot of mechanics to go into that.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Sure, okay I appreciate that. Just finally on the capacity payments for your 2007 projection and assumption that you expect to $35 million it could stir up capacity cost. You just go into that more detail there?
Benjamin Fowke: Sure, as our level grows we need to make sure that we have the capacity whether owned or purchased to serve the load. And the good news is that under the Colorado settlement we were able to achieve a capacity wider so the capacity cost flow through automatically. But that’s very credit supportive by the way and I think that’s one of the -- I think benefits out of the Colorado settlement. However, we don’t have those mechanisms in Minnesota or Texas, so as we need to add capacity for growing sales, the support growth, sales growth is what we are doing.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Is it higher capacity cost or is it actual more volume or the combination of both?
Benjamin Fowke: It's more volume, more volume driven than actual increases in the capacity cost that we already have.
Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities: Right, I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karen Choi with Alliance Bernstein.
Karen Choi - Alliance Bernstein: Hi, I just had another question about the hybrid security. With the hybrid be issued at the operating company level or at the holding company? And if that was issued at the operating level company, what type of regulatory treatment would it get?
Benjamin Fowke: I think the current plans would contemplate to be **0117issued at the holding company level.
Karen Choi - Alliance Bernstein: Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Greg Gordon with Citigroup.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Thanks, just to get you on this capacity question again, I’m a little bit confused. When we plug this $35 million of incremental capacity costs into your jurisdictional cost profile in Minnesota and SDS, isn’t that going to be a drag on your authorized returns, shouldn’t we assume that you ultimately file for those costs?
Benjamin Fowke: Oh there is a drag on the -- there is no doubt about it. It’s just like O&M, those are drags on your cost, Greg, but that’s what you have sales growth for another items.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, so you don’t think that the -- that when we bottle these down the ROE that it causes you to under earn your authorized returns in those jurisdictions?
Benjamin Fowke: I don’t think it would cause us to significantly under earn but some of that will depend on actual sales growth. I should point out that we do have a major customer in our Minnesota jurisdiction coming back online next year as a retail customer. So some of those capacity cost support increase sales growth there and margin growth there. So I think all in all it’s just the function of meeting increased revenues coming from our sales growth.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, I understand so in it's totality it's really that top line revenue growth and that of these costs?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Think of those things in together not separate?
Benjamin Fowke: Yes.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, and then just going back to your CapEx forecast, which expenditures on this forecast are one's that you don’t already sort of have recovery from some sort of mechanism or aren’t captured in sort of an extend rate case where we should assume that there is going to be some sort of discussion with the regulator around cost recovery going forward, is it just -- is it 180 million a year and the nuclear line or is it less than that or are there other CapEx numbers here that aren’t already wrapped into a regulatory discussion?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, I think if you -- we are going to give more detail on this, by the way, Greg, at the EEI conference but if you go through our capital expenditures the breakouts, you have your base capital expenditure programs, most of that’s going to be covered through your traditional regulatory cost recovery methods either historical forward attached year depending on the jurisdiction as MERP is a forward-looking rider recovery in Minnesota, Comanche 3 we had the ability to bring in forward-looking clip as we file away cases. Minnesota Wind Transmission and CapEx 2020 are coverage for forward rider mechanisms and as I mentioned the nuclear capacity increases in life extension. Right now the method would be filing the right case. We are going to work with the commission and staff next year to try to get alternative recovery mechanism in price.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, so the 160 is spent this year and future CapEx you have forecast, those are not roll into our recovery mechanism as yet?
Benjamin Fowke: Correct.
Greg Gordon - Citigroup: Okay, thanks guys.
Benjamin Fowke: Okay.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Yeah I, just wondering how much capacity will you add to your plants and by what year?
Benjamin Fowke: We add to our -- whether the capacity that we bring --
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Its just going to be upgrade, I’m sorry, yeah.
Benjamin Fowke: You’re talking about the capacity increase for our nuclear plants?
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Yes.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, that will add 250 megawatts of increased capacity that wouldn’t come on line until -- yeah I believe the actual operates will be past the 2010 timeframe.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Okay, great thank you. This is the work that get -- the expenditures that get you there.
Daniele Seitz - Dahlman Rose: Yeah, thanks.
operator: Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Good morning. First of all I just want clarification on that transmission field reclassification, it looks like -- it’s coming out of but what has been going into?
Benjamin Fowke: First of all, Dan there is no net income impact from the re-class, basically as we look at the rules we apply those to contracts that were expiring and as we renegotiated those just put them where they will -- their components will better classified.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Where is the offset then for the --
Benjamin Fowke: You see a $21 million reduction in O&M offset by $21 million reduction from our operating margin.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Approximates on, are the revenue essentially or --?
Benjamin Fowke: It’s added, its increasing cost of goods sold, its lower in O&M.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay.
Benjamin Fowke: No net income impact.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, Ben I was wondering on your nuclear outages list, what kind of assumptions you have for that for ‘07 and I didn’t see that list among your assumption?
Benjamin Fowke: It’s a good question. We only have one-outages next year versus two this year, which helps to keep the O&M at the lower level that we are assuming.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Which unit is that?
Benjamin Fowke: Minnesota, yeah it’s Minnesota.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Is that one of the units that will be upgraded? Will that --?
Benjamin Fowke: We are ultimately we’re looking to operate all three units.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: I assume the operable process will take place during outages, is that right?
Benjamin Fowke: No not at this outage that we are talking about in ‘07.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, so it’s … after ‘07 that will see the operation of those various units?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, it operates and life extension. So we are going to start doing some of the work to get the life extended things like steam generators and the other things that are necessary to get the plants. The life extended along with the capacity expansions that will be -- the expenditures will happen further along in a decade.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, have you all ready filed with the NRC to get the licenses extended as well.
Benjamin Fowke: Yes, 
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay you have gotten all those approvals?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, within the state as well we expect approval in actually November this year. We will expect to get some of the approvals, we have also filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission those filings are going pretty well.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay. And then I was just curious on your capital structure, you mentioned you intend to continue to deleverage going forward, what do you have -- kind of a target debt or equity ratio that you are looking to get to?
Benjamin Fowke: We don’t have a target per se but we would like to see the balance sheet continue to be strengthened. And again we will give you some more details on this at the EEI conference but basically strong cash flow from operations and growth and earnings will help contribute it to the deleveraging along with the fact that we currently have about $300 million of convertible notes of the holding company that are classified as debt. They are going to roll off beginning next year and into ‘08 and that will add about 200 basis points to our equity ratio.
Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Elizabeth Parrella with Merrill Lynch.
Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Hi, Ben, thanks very much. Questions, just a follow up on the capacity cost increases. Based on the projects or contracts that you have gotten in place today in those two jurisdictions, can you give us kind of an order of magnitude what the increase would look like ‘08 assuming that you don’t get any regulatory relief for this, either through new base rates or a tracker mechanism?
Benjamin Fowke: For our capacity cost that we --
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: In Minnesota and Texas where you don’t get recovery, I know if you are seeing $35 million in ‘07, based on the contract for the signup that may be coming on in ‘08, how much of an increase sort of order of magnitude might we see in ‘08 for this.
Benjamin Fowke: You know, Elizabeth, but I don’t have -- I don’t think anybody else in the room has an answer of that. I know what it will be greater at SPS but you have to follow up on that also.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and just two other quick questions. One is what’s the timing on the SPS’s wholesale case in terms of that getting resolved?
Benjamin Fowker: One that -- with the various regulatory compliance that we have?
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Right, where you have accrued $16 million of the regulatory --
Benjamin Fowke: Well there is no set timetable. We expect the New Mexico hearing or order coming out any day but there is no firm timetable and there is no firm timetable for us to look at it.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: All right, and then the other question would be just I guess two quicker related questions of -- you have mentioned things that could cause you to consider having to do equity and I’m wondering whether losing (inaudible) and having to make a substantial repayment to the IRS which obviously you funded a liquidity at least initially, does that cause your thinking on equity issuance to change at all?
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah I think, Elizabeth, that’s exactly the kind of thing that will keep our financing plans flexible for -- we obviously don’t anticipate losing (inaudible), but if that happened it would required and the way would be funded is about half of it would be in cash, half of it would be in acceleration of those forward-looking analog tax benefits that we talked about. So you are looking at -- and then we probably would like as you mentioned funded off of our credit lines. But and ultimately I think you would have to issues some equity to make sure that our credit matrix stay strong. We want to do that immediately and we have obviously worked with regulators etc and it wouldn’t be any -- while you are -- there wouldn’t be any cash outlay for say but I think your point is spot on and that’s the kind of credit, adverse credit event that we would adopt to.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and last question, can you get us the operating cash flow number for the quarter in the year-to-date?
Benjamin Fowke: I can give it to year-to-date, operating cash flow year-to-date was one $1.6 billion that is in total I think from continuing operations to about $100 to $150 million less than that.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Actually, Elizabeth we have seen the falling fuel prices, the efforts we have made to improve our collection process, we have seen some pretty substantial increases in working capital so its been a pretty good cash year for us.
Elizabeth Parrella - Merrill Lynch: Yes, it’s apparent, okay, thanks Ben
Operator: Your next question comes from Shelby Tucker with Bank of America.
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: Hi, Ben
Benjamin Fowke: Hey Shelby.
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: Quick question on – sort of remind me your long-term dividend policies?
Benjamin Fowke: Long-term dividend policies 2% to 4%.
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: Okay, more compiled ratio.
Benjamin Fowke: Yeah, its also looking at our overall capital expenditure program and, everything else that goes into meeting, growing earnings, investing significant capital, keeping your credit rating strong, your balance sheet strong. We stated previously that the pay out ratio the target range is 60% to 75%.
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: Okay, I guess if you look at my spreadsheet, about 65% that ratio by the end of this year or the next.
Benjamin Fowke: I am sorry on what pay out ratio?
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: About 65% and if that is the case at what point would you consider an increase in that gross rates. 
Benjamin Fowke: Well, I think you better of -- shall be assuming the 2% to 4% range, I mean clearly that’s a board decision. Again that’s going to be balanced against the things we talked about one needs to keep a strong balance sheet, one into invest as we talked about so nothing is ever said in stone but I think that is the assumption I would be working off. 
Shelby Tucker - Bank of America: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from Paul Rizdon with KeyBank.
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: Can you just refresh our memories, have you altered your depreciation schedule for the nuclear plants or are you waiting for some sort of approval?
Benjamin Fowke: No we did, we did have an order this year that changed the decommission in accruals, other than that no.
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: So, when you get this order is that potential upside to your G&A guidance?
Benjamin Fowke: No
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: You don’t plan on changing your depreciation lines or?
Benjamin Fowke: The area that -- hang on a second, Paul, why don’t you answer the question?
Unidentified Company Representative: There is no change in the depreciation (inaudible) been ordered by the commission. Obviously as we spend more money investing the plants and looking at some recovery we’ll also address the depreciation lines for those plants.
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: So net, do you anticipate kind of the nuclear depreciation, kind of flat line or how does that going directionally.
Benjamin Fowke: Well, certainly if we extended in life, the depreciation go down but again keep in mind of the additional capital investment, (inaudible) commission look at what is the incremental capital that’s been invested, what is the change of depreciation life and come up to some kind of regulatory treatment to reflect that.
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: So the instant you get the NRC order its still need to be resolved at state level?
Benjamin Fowke: That’s correct. There is no windfall that built into our guidance range.
Paul Rizdon - KeyBank: Thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: Thanks Paul
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with SAC Capital.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: My questions had been answered, just a follow-up. What makes the effective tax rate when to be between 28, I'm just trying to understand the range. What makes it go lower, what makes it go higher?
Benjamin Fowke: What makes it go lower is when we are able to take tax benefits that we typically don’t enjoy on a continuous basis. For example, this year we were able to release reserve that we had on some capital losses because we were able to put in a strategy that allow us to achieve capital gains. The reason why you see the effect of tax rate higher next year is because we don’t anticipate that sort of benefits. Then the other thing you need to look at Ashar is the level of base pre-tax income which will affect things as well, because remember the benefit is going to be there -- period. So as earnings grow your ETR rate will grow naturally. But the big driver is by far the ability that -- the amount of tax benefits that we have that are so lack of a better word, one time in nature.
Ashar Khan - SAC Capital: Okay, thank you.
Benjamin Fowke: You’re welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Gentlemen are there any closing remarks?
 Benjamin Fowke - Chief Financial Officer and VP: Yeah, I have jus a couple. First I wanted to thank everybody for participating in our earnings call this morning. I also want to take a just moment to thank somebody that’s been an incredible resource to me in my role as CFO, and that’s Dick Kolkmann. Dick is going to retire at the end this year after 34 years of outstanding service. I’m going to miss him; the company is going to miss him. But we wishing well in his retirement and I think many of you will be at EEI we will be and please take a moment to wish Dick Kolkmann in his retirement. He is a class act all the way. So with that thank you and we look forward to see you at EEI, thanks.
Operator: This concludes today’s Excel Energy Q3 2006 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2006 Q2  (2006-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Richard Kolkmann, Managing Director of IR   Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP
Analysts: Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments   Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial   Elizabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch   Paul Debbas, Value Line   Ashar Khan, SAC Capital   Nathan Judge, Atlantic Equities   Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xcel Energy Second Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question and answer session. At that time we will only take questions from analysts and institutional investors. Any other questions from the news medium can direct their questions to the Investor Relations Department. If you have a question at that time simply press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. And if you would like to withdraw your question, press * then the number 2. Thank you, I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Kolkmann. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Richard Kolkmann, Managing Director of IR: Thanks Matthew and welcome to Xcel Energy's Second Quarter 2006 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Dick Kolkmann, Managing Director of Investor Relations, and with me is Ben Fowke, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy. We also have several others here to help provide answers to your questions. Some of the comments that will be made contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and Xcel Energy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Thanks Dick and welcome everyone. Xcel Energy recorded earnings from continuing operations of $0.24 per share for the second quarter of 2006. This compares with $0.19 per share for the second quarter of 2005. Total earnings for the second quarter 2006 were $0.24 per share compared with $0.20 per share for 2005. Our earnings from continuing operations increased by $0.05 per share for the quarter, largely due to higher electric retail margins which increased earnings by $0.10 per share, a lower effective tax rate which increased earnings by $0.02 per share, and other items that together increased earnings by about $0.01 per share. These positive factors were partially offset by lower short-term wholesale margins which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share, higher utility O&M expenses which decreased earnings by $0.01 per share, and higher depreciation expense which decreased earnings by $0.01 per share. That summarizes our second quarter 2006 results. Now, let's look into the details. Our base retail electric utility margins increased by $71 million or $0.10 per share for the quarter, largely driven by rate increases and weather. Electric margin grew by $54 million from various rate increases. This includes $40 million from the interim rate increase in Minnesota, $9 million from the implementation of the MERP rider, and $5 million for an electric rate increase in Wisconsin. Weather was also a positive factor. We experienced warmer than normal temperatures in Minnesota, Texas, and Colorado in June. As a result, our electric margin increased by $8 million compared with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our weather adjusted sales growth was a solid 1.8%, which is slightly higher than our annual assumption range of 1.3% to 1.7%. While we’re not adjusting our sales growth assumptions, we view this as a positive trend. While we’re on the topic of retail margin let me update you on a complaint filed with the FERC by several customers served by SPS. The dispute relates to whether fuel cost of certain wholesale customers should be based on system average cost or incremental fuel cost. In May 2006, and contrary to the position of FERC staff, an Administrative Law Judge recommended among other things that SPS recalculate its fuel cost billings to reduce fuel and purchase energy cost for certain customers. While we think the ALJ recommendation is incorrect, if the FERC was to affirm the ALJ’s findings, the potential refund exposure could be up to $50 million. We do not think this is likely because we made wholesale firm power sales consistent with the FERC pricing policies for long-term sales. That said, during the quarter we accrued $4 million giving us a total reserve of $7 million for the potential liability based on our assessment of the FERC rules as it applies to both base rate and fuel item. We intend to vigorously challenge the ALJ’s recommendations with the FERC. Moving on to short-term wholesale margins, for the quarter our margins declined by approximately $43 million compared with last year. In the second quarter, we recorded two adjustments which impacted short-term and energy trading margins. First, we reduced short-term wholesale margins by $13 million for a year-to-date adjustment for customer sharing in Minnesota under the proposed settlement agreement. This adjustment did not affect net income because the impact of the sharing agreement was already reflected in our accrual for interim rates. This is merely a reclassification to present the results consistent with the settlement agreement. Turning to operating expenses, our second quarter O&M expenses increased $5 million or 1.3%. This increase was in line with our expectations. Based on our most current projection, we believe that our 2006 O&M expenses should increase 3% to 4% over 2005 levels, which is consistent with our guidance assumption. Now that said, we will closely monitor the continued hot weather and its potential impact. We will spend the necessary dollars to maintain our system. In the second quarter, depreciation expense increased $10 million or 5%, driven by increased capital spending and changes in decommissioning accruals. There is no change in our guidance assumption for depreciation. In the second quarter of 2006, we had an effective tax rate of 17.3%, compared with an effective tax rate of 24.1% in 2005. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 increased quarterly and year-to-date earnings by approximately $0.02 per share and was driven by two items: first, we recognized a tax benefit of almost $17 million resulting from a reversal of a valuation allowance for capital loss carry forwards. We also recorded an interim tax adjustment as required under APB 28, which partially offset the impact of the tax benefits on our effective tax rates. As a result of the realized tax benefits, we have lowered our 2006 effective tax rate assumption. We are now expecting the effective tax rate to be between 24% to 26%. That wraps up the explanation of the quarterly results. Next, I would like to update you on regulatory initiatives. Let me start with the case that is nearest completion. As you’re probably aware, in Minnesota, we have requested an electric rate increase of $156 million. This is based on an ROE of 11% and a forecasted test year with a projected equity ratio of almost 52% and projected rate base of $3.2 billion. On July 6th, the Administrative Law Judge recommended a 2006 rate increase of approximately $135 million based on an ROE of 10.64%. She also recommended a $16 million reduction from that level for 2007 to reflect a large customer returning as a full requirements customer in 2007. While we don’t agree with all of her conclusions, overall we think that the ALJ made a fair and constructive recommendation. The Minnesota Commission is expected to hold it’s deliberation in the first two weeks of August, a final order is expected in September. In April 2006, we requested an increase in Colorado electric rates of $210 million, effective in 2007. The request is based on an ROE of 11%, an equity ratio of almost 60% and a rate base of $3.4 billion. While the case is based on a 2005 historic test year, the filing is adjusted for known and measurable changes. A procedural schedule has been established and is included in the earnings release. The next milestone is Intervener Testimony, which is scheduled to be filed on August 18th. Hearings are expected to start in late October and a decision is expected by the end of the year with final rates in effect in early 2007. In taxes, we’ve requested an electric rate increase of $48 million, based on an ROE of 11.6% and a historic test year with an equity ratio of 51% and a rate base of $943 million. Intervener Testimony is scheduled to be filed in late October and hearings are planned for late November through early December. A decision is expected during the first part of 2007, final rates should go into effect the first quarter of 2007. That’s an update on our regulatory developments. Another major component of our strategy is our investment in our utility assets, on the generation side of the business that includes our MERP and Comanche 3 projects. Both projects remain on track. For MERP, all major contracts have been awarded for the King plant. For the High Bridge plant 77% of the project is under contract, while at the Riverside plant, which is the smallest and last in the schedule, approximately 18% of the project is under contract. We are current forecasting to earn a return of 10.62% for the MERP projects. For Comanche 3, all the major contracts are in place and 76% of the project is under contract. Looking at transmission, in June, we announced the initial proposal of CapEx 2020, which is an alliance of electric cooperatives, municipals, and investor owned utilities in the upper Midwest, which includes Xcel Energy. The CapEx 2020 alliance has identified three groups of transmission projects that it proposes to complete by 2020. As you know, adequate transmission is an issue nationally and CapEx 2020 will help address this issue in Minnesota and the surrounding area. Group 1, the first stage of the project is a series of four transmission lines. The preliminary estimate of the total investment for Group 1 is about $1.3 billion. Xcel Energy’s investment will be about $700 million. Major construction is expected to start in 2009 or 2010, and entry of four years later. You should note that the capital expenditures for CapEx 2020 will start ramping up just as the expenditures for Comanche 3 and MERP are winding down. To support the CapEx 2020 program, Minnesota and South Dakota have passed legislation allowing us to recover transmission investments outside of a rate case through a wider mechanism. This allows us to earn a cash return on our transmission investment while the project is under construction. This type of recovery greatly reduces regulatory uncertainty and supports a strong balance sheet. We’re very excited about the CapEx 2020 project, which represents a significant portion of the second phase of our build-to-core strategy. Before I wrap things up, I want to mention that yesterday we closed on the sale of our Oklahoma and Kansas assets to Tri-County Electric Cooperative and received net cash proceeds of approximately $24 million. While it’s a small transaction, it once again highlights that we are clearly focused on our core operations in the core jurisdictions that we serve. In closing, we’ve put together two good quarters of earnings results. Earnings along with improvements in working capital have generated over $1.1 billion of cash from continuing operations year-to-date. Now, cash from operations will move up and down throughout the year based on working capital needs, but this is a year-to-date increase of almost $500 million compared with last year and represents a significant improvement. In June, we experienced hot weather across our serviced territories. This trend continued into July. As a result, additional sales driven by air-conditioning load is estimated to contribute earnings of $0.02 to $0.03 per share in July. Even in the distress of the summer heat our electric system has performed very well. This really is a credit to our employees throughout the organization who have toiled in the heat to ensure that our plants and transmission and distribution systems are up and running when our customers need the power. Now, let me give you a quick example of strong operating performance. During the quarter, we completed an outage at our Prairie Island Nuclear plant in which we replaced the reactor head and fuel assemblies. Even with the outage our nuclear capacity factor for the first six months of the year was over 90%; that’s pretty good performance. Everything considered we are positioned to deliver on our 2006 earnings guidance range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share from continuing operations. So, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Please limit your questions to one per caller, and if you have a followup question you may re-enter the queue. Again that’s * then the number 1 if you have a question, and we’ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Paul Rizdon.
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: Good morning. I have a question on the tax item reducing the effective tax rate, is that going to be an ongoing thing, I was a little confused about that?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: The $0.04 of the capital loss carry forwards, which we recognized this quarter, you should view that as a one-time event; $0.02 of that was offset by an interim tax adjustment that we were required to make under APB 28, the accounting for taxes. So, together, I view that as a one-time event.
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: The $0.02 net was one time?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: The $0.02 net was one time, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniele Seitz.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Hi, so you are going back to a normal tax rate of 24% or so?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Well, for this year Daniele, for our effective tax rate assumption we think the range now will be in the 24% to 26% range.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: I’m sorry I should have mentioned that, I was talking about 2007, are you going back to a normal tax rate or is your tax rate still going to be relatively low?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: No, because these are one time items we’ll issue that assumption with our 2007 guidance, but it will be more of a normal effective tax rate.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Okay, may I ask another one, just a quick question? You mentioned that you had made some reserves of $7 million during the quarter, is this also a sort of one time or do you anticipate to continue reserving up to $50 million?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Well, if you look at one times, we talked about the positive tax benefits. For your point, we made a $4 million accrual which brought the reserve up to $7 million year-to-date for the SPS issue from a rate and fuel case item. I think that you should view that as one time. We’ll obviously have to monitor the litigation going forward. In addition, Daniele, we took at a $6 million charge this quarter for the FERC recommendation to reallocate cost associated with some financial transactions made under MISO. I think you should view that as a one time item as well.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Okay, so in the case of FERC you are not going to continue reserving for that?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: We will continue to assess the liability but that’s not the plan.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Okay, great, thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Elizabeth Parrella.
Elizabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch: Thank you and I apologize if you addressed this in your prepared remarks; I had to join the call a little bit late. In the Minnesota rate case, what’s the amount that you’re currently booking the revenues at and how much did you book in the second quarter?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: It’s $65 million I believe year-to-date and $40 million for the three months ended June 30th.
Elizabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch: And what kind of rate is that say relative to where the ALJ is for example? You told us what it was in the first quarter, I’m not sure if you’re still booking at that level though?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: It’s roughly equivalent to the ALJ recommendation, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch: Okay, with respect to the CapEx 2020, I think you said $700 million of CapEx, your share of this program, could you give us an idea as to kind of when you start spending on that and how it looks roughly by year?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: I don’t know if I have a year-to-year breakout, we might have some additional detail, I don’t have with me. But, the expenditures really start in the latter part of the decade, the ’09 and ’10 and then continue for ’11, ’12, and ’13, and Elizabeth as you know that’s about the time that our CapEx expenditure for Comanche 3 will be ramping down.
Elizabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Debbas.
Paul Debbas, Value Line: Hi, given the better weather and the lower tax rate, why haven’t you raised the guidance?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Paul, we haven’t done that because as you probably know the third quarter for us is our busiest earnings season and as I mentioned on the call it’s also when we will get a final ruling on this significant rate case in Minnesota. So, I think it makes a lot of sense to get through the summer and see how we did with the rate case, and then if need be update you on our guidance range on the third quarter call.
Paul Debbas, Value Line: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ashar Khan.
Ashar Khan, SAC Capital: My question has been answered, thanks.
Operator: Okay, we have a followup question from Paul Rizdon.
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: It’s kind of on Paul Debbas’ question, when you give your guidance are you treating the $0.02 tax benefit as an unusual item or is that embedded in the guidance?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: When we reaffirm guidance, were you talking about ’07 now?
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: ’06.
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: No, it’s embedded.
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: And any progress with the IRS?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: No, nothing really, are you talking about the Coley litigation?
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: Yes.
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Nothing really to report there. We filed a second motion for summary judgment. That will be heard later this month, no timetable on when we’ll get a decision on that. And as you probably know the trial itself is scheduled to start beginning of ’07. We expect to have an answer two to three months later.
Paul Rizdon, McDonald Investments: Okay, thank you again.
Operator: Your next question is from Daniele Seitz.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: I recall that’s more long term, but when do you think of planning for additional capacity either in Minnesota or Colorado, and is there a procedure that you have to go through?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: We went through in Colorado, Daniele, the least cost planning process a couple of years ago and Comanche 3 came out of that along with more commitments to wind and other things. Here in Minnesota we’re in the middle of that resource planning process and working very closely with the commission and staff to develop recommendations. Preliminary recommendations are more wind production, increase in base load capacity of 375 megawatts…I believe we said we need that by 2014, and we’re looking at other aspects of the resource plan too. So, we’re right in the midst of it here in Minnesota.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: And do you at least know the special requirement in terms of how much you are supposed to build relative to what you are supposed to purchase, because I’m assuming the wind production, would you be a builder or would you just buy it?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Well that remains to be seen. Historically we’ve been a buyer, not a builder.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Right, there is no requirement as to the level of purchase power that you will prefer?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: No, clearly what you do is justify the least cost.
Daniele Seitz, Maxcor Financial: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Once again if you do have a question that’s * and then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. And our next question comes from Nathan Judge.
Nathan Judge, Atlantic Equities: Hello, I wanted to just ask a question about the wholesale commodity trading margins. I know there’s quite a bit going on there including sharing and I guess, if I understand the text correctly, there is some depression of margins as you didn’t have as much availability to sell into wholesale market. It looks a bit weak especially considering that you’re looking for $10 million to $20 million from that business for the full year, could you go into greater detail that is in line with your expectations?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: For the six months, even with the reclassifications associated with the partial settlement, Nathan, which I can run through with you if you’re not familiar with it, we’re at $14 million, so I think the range is pretty appropriate. You know, we’re having a very hot summer and it’s not a lot of capacity when you’re meeting your own customer needs.
Nathan Judge, Atlantic Equities: So, the commodity trading margin of negative 8 in the short term wholesale margin is 4, as I understand it’s pretty much in line with your expectations?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: It is, just remember as I mentioned on the call, you have to back out those adjustments that we made, the big adjustment being the space for reclassification, the year-to-date reclassification which reflects the settlement agreement we entered into in Minnesota, where for the last several years the majority of our short-term wholesale trading margins have come from.
Nathan Judge, Atlantic Equities: So, if I were to look at what that was perhaps a year ago, again is that 24/7 with readjustments or it would only impact this year?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Only this year.
Nathan Judge, Atlantic Equities: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from Dan Jenkins.
Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Good morning. Just looking at your sales growth on a normalized basis in the quarter, the commercial and industrial were weaker than what they were in the first quarter, I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit, what’s going on.
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Dan, I think what you really have to do is look at the year-to-date trend. You may recall in the last quarter I mentioned don’t read too much into the stronger than anticipated sales that we saw in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005. You’re always going to have some noise in the system quarter to quarter. We were implementing last year a billing system, so that potentially can SKU the data even more than you typically see quarter to quarter. So, I would stick with the six months’ trend as something more indicative of what we expect for the full year.
Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board: So, 1.9, you would expect the second half would be like?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: We haven’t changed our assumption, but we do think that’s far more indicative than the quarterly results.
Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question please press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad.
Richard Kolkmann, Managing Director of IR: This is Dick Kolkmann. I understand that some of you have experienced some disconnects on the call today, we apologize for that. The call will be available for replay probably in a couple of hours. So, if you have any questions, you’ve missed anything just give Paul Johnson or myself a call.
Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board: I apologize for that too, but I thank you for participating on the call today and again if you have any followup questions, Dick and Paul will be here to help you. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator Instructions:
Richard Kolkmann, Managing Director of IR: Thank you, Michael. And welcome to Xcel Energy's First Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dick Kolkmann, Managing Director of Investor Relations, and with me is Ben Fowke, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Xcel Energy. We also have several others here to help provide answers to your questions. Some of the comments that will be made contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and Xcel Energy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I'll turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Thanks, Dick. And welcome everyone. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong first quarter, which gives us a nice jump on the year. Xcel Energy recorded earnings from continuing operations of $0.36 per share for the first quarter of 2006. This compares with $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2005. Total earnings for the first quarter 2006 were $0.36 per share compared with $0.29 per share for 2005. I'm also happy to say there was very little activity to discuss related to discontinued operations. Our utility operations provided earnings of $0.38 per share for the first quarter 2006, compared with $0.32 per share for 2005. Our utility earnings increased by $0.06 per share, largely due to higher electric margin which increased earnings by $0.09 per share; higher short-term wholesale margins, which increased earnings by $0.01 per share; and other items that together increased earnings by about $0.03 per share. These positive factors were partially offset by higher utility O&M expenses, which decreased earnings by $0.05 per share, and higher depreciation expense, which decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. Our holding company costs and other results reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share for the first quarter 2006, which was comparable to a loss of $0.02 per share recorded last year. These costs are largely financing costs at the holding company. That summarizes our first quarter 2006 results. Now let's look into the details. Our base electric utility margins increased by $67 million, or $0.09 per share for the quarter, largely driven by rate increases and sales growth. Electric margin increased by $36 million for various rate increases. This includes $25 million from the in-home rate increase in Minnesota, 9 million for the implementation of the MERP Rider, and 2 million for an electric rate increase in Wisconsin. Clearly, we are starting to see the financial benefits of our 'build the core' strategy. We also experienced solid sales growth during the quarter, which on a weather-adjusted basis grew at 3%, increasing electric margin by $20 million. It's important to note that sales in the first quarter of 2005 were at lower levels, so we don't think it's appropriate to extrapolate this growth rate to an annual level. We continue to feel that our annual weather-adjusted sales growth will be in the range of 1.3% to 1.7%. These positive developments offset the unfavorable impact of warmer than normal temperatures during the quarter, which reduced electric utility margins by $6 million compared to last year. Short-term wholesale and trading margins were also positive factors. We recorded margins of $25 million for the quarter, which was an increase of $10 million compared with last year. The increase was driven by strong commodity trading margins, which largely reflect price differentials between the east and the west, which we took advantage of, and a few structured transactions that we initiated during the quarter. These transactions were opportunistic, with no guarantee that they will be repeated. Our primary focus is maximizing our generation portfolio to benefit our retail customers. We haven't changed our philosophy or our risk profile, but we will take advantage of opportunities when they occur. Turning to operating expenses, our first quarter O&M expenses increased $33 million or 8%, largely driven by increases in bad debt expenses and employee benefit costs. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter. On a percentage basis, the increase for the quarter was higher than our annual guidance. This is not indicative of a trend. As you're probably aware, quarterly O&M expenses can vary significantly. For example, during the quarter, we accrued $19 million for bad debt expense, but this does not represent a quarterly run rate. As we continue to improve our collection processes, we expect our bad debt accruals to be approximately $36 million for the full year. Based on our most current projection, we continue to believe our 2006 O&M expenses should increase 3% to 4% over 2005 level. Our first quarter depreciation expense increased $11 million, or 5.7%, largely driven by increased capital spending and changes in decommissioning accruals. For 2006, our decommissioning accruals are now set at $44 million, which reflects recent regulatory decisions in both Minnesota and Wisconsin. While this is lower than our original projection of $80 million, it still represents an increase over 2005 accruals, which were $23 million. We are recovering the increase in rates, so the changes in accrual levels had no impact on earnings or cash flows. Well, that covers 2006 first quarter results. Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes on some recent regulatory development. In November, 2005, NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of $168 million based on an ROE of 11% and a forecasted test year with a projected equity ratio of almost 52%, and projected rate base of $3.2 billion. At the end of March, we filed rebuttal testimony, and adjusted our rate increase to $156 million, largely due to a reduction in decommissioning accruals. The change in decommissioning accruals is based on a recent Commission ruling and will not impact earnings or cash flow. On April 13th, various interveners filed rebuttal testimony. The Department of Commerce recommended a 2006 rate increase of $110 million, based on a 10.64% return on equity. Their testimony included a recommendation to reduce our rate request by $22 million for projected short-term wholesale and trading margins. They also recommended a $20 million revenue reduction in 2007, because the Flint Hills refinery is returning to our system as a customer. The testimony from the office of the attorney general focused on refunding a portion of the NRG tax benefit to customers. Clearly, this represents inconsistent regulatory treatment, since the customers never bore the losses associated with NRG, and therefore should not receive the benefit. We expect the Minnesota Commission to continue to uphold the time-tested compact of separating the cost and benefits of the regulated company from the non-regulated company. This week, we reached an agreement regarding short-term, wholesale, and trading margins with most interveners. While the Department of Commerce is not a party to the agreement, they have indicated that they do not object to the settlement. The agreement is structured so that all short-term, wholesale, and trading margins will flow through the fuel costs adjustment, rather than a base rate credit. The terms of the agreement include the following: 100% of asset-based margins would be refunded to customers; spin sale margins would be shared, with 80% refunded to customers, and 20% remaining with shareholders; non-asset based margins, or proprietary trading margins, would be shared with 25% refunded to the customers, and 75% remaining with the shareholders. We think this is a reasonable agreement. We'd like to have retained a larger percentage of potential short-term margins for our shareholders; however, this agreement eliminates the downside risk of base rates being lowered for a projected amount of short-term wholesale margins, which may or may not occur. While we gave up most of the upside, we still preserve some potential upside for proprietary trading and spin sales. All in all, this agreement reduces the volatility of our earnings and lowers our risk profile. A final decision on the entire case is expected in the third quarter. In April 2006, we also requested to increase electric rates in Colorado by $210 million, effective in 2007. The request is based on an 11% ROE, an equity ratio of almost 60%, and a rate base of $3.4 billion. We recently filed our 2005 electric earnings test in Colorado. As indicated in our filing, PSCo earned 8.5% in 2005 compared with the current authorized ROE of 10.75%. This represented a revenue deficiency of $64 million. Our rate filing will help address this deficiency in 2007. While the case is based on a 2005 historic test year, the filing is adjusted for known and measurable changes. A decision is expected by the end of the year with final rates in effect in early 2007. That's an update on our regulatory developments. We believe our regulators will provide us with reasonable recovery and that's reflected in our guidance range. Recent constructive results, along with past rulings, are evidence of a reasonable regulatory treatment and give us confidence that we're pursuing the right strategy. So with that, I'll wrap things up. We're off to a good start with solid first quarter results. We've filed our Colorado electric rate case. We've reached a settlement with various interveners on short-term margins and continue to make progress in our Minnesota electric rate case. Last Friday, we had a groundbreaking ceremony at the High Bridge plant in St. Paul to kick-off the construction of a new combined cycle natural gas plant at the site, the second plant covered under the Minnesota Emissions Reduction Project, or MERP. And after two years of negotiations, we recently reached a new 20-year franchise agreement with the City of Denver; and finally, we continue to believe that we can deliver on our 2006 earnings range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share from continuing operations. Let's open it up for questions.
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Paul Debbas: Hi. This is Paul Debbas. What financing or refinancing plans do you have for this year?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Total financings will be in the order of $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Most of that's refinancing will probably add an incremental debt of about $300 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Citigroup.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Greg.
Q - Greg Gordon: Good morning, guys. Well, I feel very constrained here with one question, so I'll have to use my best one. Can you give us a little bit of context on the settlement on wholesale margins, and the way maybe to help us doing that is look at your last year's wholesale margins, and maybe explain to us how those would have been adjusted up or down if this settlement had been applied to the wholesale margins you earned last year?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, a couple of things, Greg. First of all, we would have had a significant revenue increase as part of this settlement. Most of those margins that came off of the generation stack other than the spin sales would have been flowed back to the customers. We would have kept 75% of the proprietary margins. So you're looking at $74 million of short-term margins other than spin sales, that would have flowed back to the customers. Greg, therein lies why I think this settlement was a reasonable settlement. We've had strong short-term margins coming out of Minnesota over the last couple of years. The downside risk of that is, we could have got into a situation where our revenue request was reduced by either a high year or an average or any other scenario, and the danger to that is that we wouldn't be able to produce those margins going forward. And in fact, if you look at our forward projections, we don't think that we're going to have those kinds of short-term margins in the future. So and in part it's because we have the conversion of two coal plants, increased sales or increased retail need. So we eliminated what I think is some significant downside risk, while still keeping some upside. Did I answer your question, Greg?
Q - Greg Gordon: Yes. I think so. I mean, basically what you're doing here is you're agreeing to share out the volatile portion of the earnings and hopefully replacing that with a stable base revenue.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah. In exchange -- in exchange for having to live up to a big credit, which we may or may not hit, we're assuming in our revenue request we get zero short-term margins and then we share from that -- from each dollar that we actually get.
Q - Greg Gordon: And what was your actual projected -- have you disclosed a projection what you were expecting to earn before sharing this year versus last year?
A - Benjamin Fowke: What we were anticipating, the Minnesota portion of short-term margins would be this year was $16 million.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay, so that's built into your current earnings guidance range so that's a fairly small impact?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah. It actually was built into the interim rating request that we had.
Q - Greg Gordon: Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll follow up offline.
A - Benjamin Fowke: As a reduction, I should add, Greg.
Q - Greg Gordon: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Paul.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Good morning. Just one thing in the release, a big chunk of the incremental benefit was kind of classed as other and tax issues. Could you give more flavor what that is and a sense of whether that's a timing issue that could be given back later in the year?
A - Benjamin Fowke: $4 million of it, or $0.01 related to the conclusion of our 2002 to 2003 audit cycle. We successfully concluded that and we’re able to release reserves associated with that. And we did then have some accounting adjustments under APB 28 which just basically adjusts your effective tax rate for what you think your full year effective tax rate's going to be. And that was about $3 million.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Nathan.
Q - Nathan Judge: Good morning. Just a quick question on the Colorado rate case. Do you have any further details as far as timing is concerned on that? Or is what you have in the press release as far as hearing by yearend about the --?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yes. The press release, Nathan, has the most up-to-date information.
Q - Nathan Judge: Are you giving any guidance as far as the earnings impact that could be related to that rate increase request?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, there really isn't any impact in '06 because we don't anticipate that the rates would be in place until early part of '07.
Q - Nathan Judge: Okay. Just in '07, what would you potentially see?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, just like this year, when we put out guidance, we'll assume we get reasonable regulatory treatment.
Q - Nathan Judge: Okay. Fair enough. Could you give us an update on your construction schedules, and how construction on some of your big plants that you're building right now are going?
A - Benjamin Fowke: The schedules are going very well. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we broke ground at the High Bridge plant, which is the second plant of the three plant MERP project. Comanche 3 is going very well. We have a little over two-thirds of both of those projects now contracted out. And what we have seen, Nathan, is on the MERP project, a little bit of cost over runs, about 5% of the overall spend which I think in this rising commodity and services market is pretty good. So we're comfortable with that, things are going really well with the project, both of them. And we're happy we're able to get the permitting done at Comanche 3 so quickly and get started on that project. I really think it was a good decision to settle and get things moving.
Q - Nathan Judge: Okay. And then just lastly, could you give us an update on your coal supply, if you are -- how you are as far as current supply and what you're seeing as far as future supply?
A - Benjamin Fowke: We are -- we're seeing for the first part of this year deliveries have been about 90% of what we've asked for through nominations. So that's a little bit of an improvement. As a result, that combined with the new aluminum rail cars that we're beginning to receive in Colorado have helped boost inventory somewhat throughout the system. I think we're averaging 26 days now. That so the breakout varies by jurisdiction and by plant. But we're seeing a little bit of an improvement, Nathan. But as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we don't think this situation's going to go away anytime soon. I think it's fundamentally a supply and demand and infrastructure issue. So we're continuing to watch it. As I -- and we are still planning, if need be, to mitigate, to make sure we have enough coal for our summer electrical needs, but a little bit of a pickup there, and again, I think a lot of that's the additional rail sets and rail cars that we have.
Q - Nathan Judge: Thank you very much for those comments.
A - Benjamin Fowke: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Fishman with A.G. Edwards.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Charles.
Q - Charles Fishman: Good morning. Will the 5% overrun on the MERP project that you talked about cause you to fall outside of the dead zone of that ROE band? In other words, so you would be -- it would trigger a lower ROE on that project pursuant to the settlement?
A - Benjamin Fowke: It could, Charles. I mean, those plants -- the way that works is each one of those three plants are basically three little mini rate cases. So you could make it up by going under one and over the other. On a composite basis and assuming we -- and we obviously are going to try very hard to get it back on track, but at the current projection levels, the overall 10.86 ROE on a combined basis would probably slip maybe 20 basis points.
Q - Charles Fishman: So 10.66?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah.
Q - Charles Fishman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Elizabeth Parrella with Merrill Lynch.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hey, Elizabeth.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Thank you. A couple of questions. On the slightly higher interest expense that you're looking for now, is that attributable to a somewhat higher debt balance? I know you indicated you'd be up about $300 million. Is that a little bit higher or is it an interest rate issue?
A - Benjamin Fowke: It's really two things, Elizabeth. The first is the interest rate issue. Rates are a little bit higher than what we had forecasted coming into the year. That's the first piece. The second piece is, we've changed our financing plan a little bit so that when we do finance, Elizabeth, we're going to take advantage of the long end of the curve. We think that's the more attractive bend of the curve. It's marginally a little more expensive, but again, we think that's the place to be given the flatness of the curve. So those two things are really driving that change in our interest expense forecast.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: So it sounds like the 300 million of incremental borrowing is still pretty consistent with what you have been thinking before?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yes.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: And is cash flow still on track with your expectations for the year?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yes, it is. Cash from operations for the first three months were 700 million, and that was -- that was pretty good for us. And so everything's still on track there.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Okay. And just one quick question another area, back to the short-term wholesale settlement issue. In terms of the 30 to 50 million that's embedded in your '06 guidance, I realize you had assumed that you'd be giving 16 million -- a 16 million credit back to customers, which you now won't have to do, but did that 30 to 50 million kind of assume the 50:50 sharing that you had put in your original rate filing?
A - Benjamin Fowke: In theory it does, Elizabeth, but that $30 to $50 million, well let me step back. When we developed that forecast, we then looked at what portion of that $30 to $50 million was related to the NSP Min jurisdiction. That portion was $16 million. That was the NSP portion of that budget as it related to short-term margins off that generation stack. That was that – that 16 million was then a reduction in our annual request versus our interim rate of request. So we would have to earn more than $16 million to start accruing 50:50 based upon our original proposal. So what that means, Elizabeth, is the rest of that number was coming from different jurisdictions or was coming from proprietary margins.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: And the piece that's coming from proprietary that would essentially relate to the NSP Minnesota, you're now going to only keep, you have to share 25%, so that would be sort of some area of exposure to the guidance. Is that the right way to think about it?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, two things. One, the Commission still has to approve that settlement, and we'll know that towards the end of the summer. Then you have to adjust it for spin sales and a few other things. So you could see some tweaking around the edges on that, Elizabeth, but I don't think it'd be a big number.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Dan.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Hi. I noticed it looks like your commercial and industrial sales were up about 3.5% and 3.6% normalized. Do you expect that rate to continue as a pretty strong economic activity in your service territories, or what's driving that?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, we had seen some pickup in the economic activity, particularly in Colorado. But, Dan, not enough for us at this point to change our full-year guidance, which is 1.3% to 1.7% pickup in sales growth rate. A couple of things to think about. One quarter does not make a year. I mean, I say that about a lot of line items on the income statement. The other thing to keep in mind is that if you look at the comparable quarter, the first quarter 2005, that was a pretty flat quarter for us. So again, I think we're seeing some nice economies and pickup in Colorado. Minnesota, Wisconsin have been strong over the last couple years, seeing some pick-up in the commercial and industrial side in Texas with our SPS territory, but not enough to change our guidance range at this point for sales.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay. On your debt, you mentioned that you need about 1.2 to 1.3 billion. Do you have like a timeframe on when you might be coming to market to get that financing?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah. In the next quarter we are looking at doing a refinancing at NSP Minnesota and potentially a financing at the holding company to term out some commercial paper.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay. And have you spoken at all with the rating agencies about, particularly, S&P since they are still at kind of mid BBB and about potentially moving those ratings up?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah. We've had our meetings with all three of the agencies, and I think they went very well. And they're quite aware of our financing plans.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up question from Greg Gordon with Citigroup.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Greg, I thought you were only going to ask one question.
Q - Greg Gordon: Yeah, I can't help myself. Sorry. And I apologize if you answered this, because I stepped out of my office briefly. But you had very strong organic growth on a weather-adjusted basis, yet you're telling us not to assume that you're seeing any sort of structural pickup in organic sales growth. We know that Colorado has got a pretty robust underlying economic backdrop. So what caused the large amount of sort of growth in the first quarter and why shouldn't we be thinking there might be a bias to the upside structurally?
A - Benjamin Fowke: I think the thing you have to keep in mind is the comparable quarter in 2005, which was really flat, if you remember. So we said at that time it was not don't, that's not indicative of a trend. And I don't think we should get out in front of ourselves when we've got a one good quarter to start off the year. We'll take it, Greg. And to your point, I think the economic signals are getting strong in Colorado again, so that's good news, but too early to tell.
Q - Greg Gordon: So these are all weather-adjusted numbers, right?
A - Benjamin Fowke: They are weather-adjusted numbers, and that's not an exact science all the time, either, so, again, I think you need to get a little further into the year before you can call it a trend.
Q - Greg Gordon: Any structural observation at least on why it would have been zero last year and 3% this year? Were there large customer changes or large residential developments that were built in the interim? I mean, anyway you can parse through the data and give us some qualitative backdrop here?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Not really. I remember last year, we were talking about the fact that '04 was a leap year. I don't think that's the data you're talking about. Greg, other than we haven't seen -- we have seen a rather the economic pick-up in Colorado in the last six months that maybe suggests that things are going very well there. That's about the only thing I could offer. And we do look at that, Greg, and if we start to think that we've got a longer term trend, then we'll change that portion of our assumptions for '06.
Q - Greg Gordon: Thank you very much.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Wang with Citadel Investment Group.
Q - Steven Wang: Hey, Ben. How are you today? Just a quick question on your commodity trading, the 14 million gross margin. You guys said that you did some structured contracts there. Was that just a Q1 benefit, or will we see it throughout the next three quarters or so, also a pickup in trading?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Excuse me, Q1 benefit, Steven.
Q - Steven Wang: Okay. And so, because in Q1 last year, you had a negative 1 million, so in Q2 to 4 is there anything that you have that residual that rolls through those?
A - Benjamin Fowke: No, I think some of it is still subject to mark to mark, but by and large, you should that's what I mentioned on the call, that you can't count on that being indicative of a trend going forward. It's opportunistic if we can do good deals and keep it in within a very low bar parameter that we have, risk parameter that we have, we'll do it. But it's not a trend.
Q - Steven Wang: Okay great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with SAC Capital.
Q - Ashar Khan: Hi, good morning. Ben, sorry I missed some of the calls. This question might be repetitive. Could you just remind us in Colorado what the rate base was in the last Commission decision, and what the equity ratio was?
A - Benjamin Fowke: The equity ratio was around 48%, and I think the rate base was 3 billion, roughly, and now we're at 3.4.
Q - Ashar Khan: Okay, okay. Thank you.
A - Benjamin Fowke: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Paul.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Thanks, again. A question on the wholesale settlement. When would that - would that be retroactive to January 1, '06, or would any benefit captured year-to-date kind of, is that safe with shareholders?
A - Benjamin Fowke: It would be retroactive to Jan 1.
Q - Paul Ridzon: And then, probably not a lot of update here, but any IRS action on COLI?
A - Benjamin Fowke: No nothing to report. We did have a mediation hearing several weeks ago and as predicted, we our positions are very much apart. So unless there's some breakthrough, you can count on us taking it to full court proceeding the beginning of next year.
Q - Paul Ridzon: And what's your best estimate as to what the length of time a fully litigated proceeding would take?
A - Benjamin Fowke: I think the trial itself will take several months. And then whoever loses is certainly going to appeal, and so I think to wrap the whole thing up could be two, maybe even three years.
Q - Paul Ridzon: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Hi, again. In your statement, you mentioned the nuclear plant costs were down 13 million because you didn't have an outage compared to last year at Monticello. I wonder if you could refresh us on what the outage schedule is for the rest of '06?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, we're going to have two outages later in the year, so it will be comparable with last year, although last year we had a ten-year inspection outage, which is a bit more expensive. We haven't disclosed at this point when those outages are going to occur in '06, Dan.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay. And you also list 5 million of higher plant maintenance costs. What are those -- what were those for?
A - Benjamin Fowke: 5 million I'm sorry, what?
Q - Dan Jenkins: Of higher plant maintenance costs.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Just miscellaneous costs, Dan, making sure that the plants are up to – have the maintenance they need to, I don't really have any specific details around that.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Was that primarily at fossil plants, or was that -- could that have been at nuclear as well?
A - Benjamin Fowke: I think -- does anyone know the exact answer to that? It's primarily the fossil plants, Dan.
Q - Dan Jenkins: Okay, thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Gentleman, are there any closing remarks?
Benjamin Fowke, Chief Financial Officer and VP: Yes. I just want to thank everybody for participating on the call this morning. I look forward to meeting with many of you in May at the AGA Conference and the Goldman Sachs Conference. And, again, if you have any follow-up questions, Dick Kolkmann and Paul Johnson will be available to take your calls. Thank you everyone.

===== 2005 Q4  (2006-02-03 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Benjamin Fowke, Vice President and CFO
Analysts: David Parker, Robert W. Baird.   Paul Ridzon, Keybanc Capital Mkts/ McDonald   Stephen Hsang, Citigroup.   Maura Shaughnessy, MFS   Elisabeth Parrella, Merrill Lynch.
Operator: And welcome to Xcel Energy’s Fourth Quarter 2005 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Benjamin Fowke, Vice President and CFO of Xcel Energy. Some of the comments that will be made contain forward-looking information, significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release in Xcel Energy filings with the Securities and Exchange commission. I will turn the call over to Ben.
Benjamin Fowke, Vice President and CFO: Thanks Dick, and welcome everyone. Xcel Energy recorded earnings from continuing operations of $1.20 per share for 2005, which was within our guidance range. This compares to $1.26 per share for 2004. Total earnings for 2005 were $1.23 per share compared with $0.87 per share for 2004. In 2005, we recorded earnings of $0.03 per share from discontinued operations, largely due to the final resolution of tax benefits associated with our divestiture of NRG. As a reminder, we recorded a loss of $0.39 per share in 2004 largely due to an asset impairment charge related to our Seren investments and a loss from the sale of Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power. Rest of my comments will be related to earnings from continuing operations. At the core of our company, we have our utility subsidiaries, which provided earnings of $1.27 per share for 2005 compared with $1.32 per share for 2004. Our utility earnings declined by $0.05 per share despite higher electric utility margins that increased earnings by $0.23 per share. The higher margins were offset by higher utility O&M expenses which decreased earnings by $0.12 per share, higher depreciation expense which decreased earnings by $0.09 per share, lower short-term wholesale margins which decreased earnings by $0.03 per share and a higher effective tax rate and other items which netted to decrease earnings by about $0.04 per share. Our holding company cost and results of other non-regulated companies reduced earnings by approximately $0.07 per share for 2005, which was comparable to a loss of $0.06 per share recorded last year. These costs are largely financing costs of the holding company. That summarizes our 2005 results, now lets look into the details. Our base electric utility margins increased by $163 million or $0.23 per share for 2005, largely driven by warm summer temperatures and sales growth. In 2005, we benefited from summer temperatures that were warmer than normal and significantly warmer than last year, which increased electric sales. As a result, favorable weather increased electric utility margins by $75 million. In addition to favorable weather conditions, weather-adjusted retail electric sales grew at 1.4% increasing electric margin by $42 million. Our electric margins also improved because we have lower accruals for customer refunds under the various quality of service programs and for refunds related to the SPS fuel reconciliation issue. The Texas commission approved our fuel reconciliation settlement in December. As a point of reference, we accrued $25 million for the SPS fuel reconciliation in 2004 compared with $4 million in 2005. For more information on electric margins please refer to our earnings release. Our short-term wholesale margins declined by $25 million in 2005. The decline in margins was actually less than we anticipated driven by strong prices particularly in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw increased market demand causing more off-peak periods that have natural gas on the margin. Therefore increases in gas commodity costs translated into both on and off-peak increased energy prices. Additionally, the warmer than expected temperatures at the end of December resulted in lower native load volumes facilitating additional surplus sales opportunity. Despite strong fourth quarter results, our 2006 guidance reflects projected short-term margins of $30 million to $50 million, which is a decline from the $86 million we’ve recorded in 2005. The anticipated decline is due to decreased opportunities resulting from the MISO Centralized Dispatch Market, normal retail customer demand growth reducing our surplus generation available for market sales and a reduction in the availability of our coal-fired resources due to work on the King Plant as part of the Merck project. In addition, as part of the Minnesota Electric Rate Case, we are proposing a short-term wholesale margin sharing mechanism to share risks and incentives more equally between customers and shareholders. Our overall earnings guidance reflects the sharing of short-term wholesale margins. Turning to operating expenses, our 2005 O&M expenses increased $87 million or 5.55% largely driven by higher benefit cost, increases in bad debt expense and higher nuclear outage cost. When we established our 2005 guidance, we expected that O&M expenses would increase by 2% to 3%, for example, we knew the benefit costs were increasing, we also noticed there would be two nuclear outages in 2005 compared with one in 2004. However, there was some cost pressures we didn’t anticipate. The best example is bad debt expense. In 2005 our bad debt expense was about $48 million, which was greater than anticipated. Quarterly increase was an anomaly due to the change in bankruptcy laws as well as higher fuel prices. During the year, we realized that because of the high fuel price environment as well as other factors we had to increase our focus on our collection and credit process. We made procedural changes to enhance the overall process resulting in adjustments to our accruals. Going forward, these procedural changes along with some changes in management should allow us to better control bad debt expense. In addition to bad debt expense, we had over $20 million of one-time O&M cost which included approximately $10 million for additional maintenance at our power plants driven by the high demands during the summer. $7 million for executive transition cost and $5 million for charitable contributions that help customers pay their heating bills. We recognized that every year includes some one-time expenses, but in 2005 we had more than our share. As a result, we think O&M in 2006 should increase 3% to 4% over 2005 levels. As expected depreciation expense for 2005 was $61 million higher than 2004 level. The increase is due to growth associated with normal system expansion and incremental depreciation for several large projects including the new steam generators of Prairie Island and the new billing systems. We expect recovery of these investments in future rate filings. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% in 2005 compared with 23.7% in 2004. As you might recall, in 2004 we recorded tax benefits of approximately $34 million or $0.08 per share primarily related to the completion of five tax audit cycles which resolved several issues related to prior years. While we recorded some additional tax benefits in 2005, it wasn’t at the level of 2004, as a result, our effective tax rate increased. Well that covers 2005 results. Next, I would like to spend a few minutes on some recent developments. In 2005, we filed several rate cases as part of our regulatory strategy. These rate cases and others that we plan to file in 2006 are some of the building blocks of our earnings growth plan. We continue to make progress on these initiatives, in particular we’ve reached favorable conclusions in the Colorado and Wisconsin cases and are on track with Minnesota Electric Case. In May 2005, PSQ filed for $34 million natural gas rate increase based on ROE of 11%. In December 2005, PSQ and various interveners reached a settlement resolving all the issues in this proceeding. The Colorado commission approved $22 million rate increase based on an ROE of 10.5%. Rates are expected to be in effect in February. In 2005, NSP-Wisconsin requested an electric revenue increase of $58 million and a gas revenue increase of $8 million based on an ROE of 11.9%. In early January, the Wisconsin commission approved an Electric Rate increase of $43.4 million and a natural gas rate increase of $3.9 million. Both were based on an authorized ROE of 11%. While we would have preferred the commission’s grant our requested rate increases in full. We believe that both the Colorado and Wisconsin rate orders were constructive outcomes overall particularly if you consider the high fuel price environment. In November 2005 NSP-Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of $158 million, which represents approximately an 8% increase. This request is based upon an ROE of 11%, a projected equity ratio of almost 52% and projected rate base of $3.2 billion. In December 2005, the Minnesota Commission authorized an interim rate increase of $147 million subject to refund, which went into effect as of January 1st 2006. A final decision is expected in the third quarter. Let me explain, how we will account for the interim rates. Starting in the first quarter, our revenue recognition will include an interim rate increase based on the prorated amount of $147 million authorized level. Prior to each quarter close, we will review whether there was any new evidence that recovery at the interim level was not probable. In the event this situation occurs, we maybe required to recognize an estimated refund of a portion of the interim rate depending on facts and circumstances. Ultimately, there maybe a final revenue “true-up” in the third quarter to reflect the final rate order. Well that’s an update of our regulatory developments. Occasionally, investors will mention that there is regulatory risk associated with the Xcel Energy because of the numerous rate cases that we are filing. Our strategy is to file reasonable rate request designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on our utility investments. We believe that our commissions will provide us with reasonable recovery and it’s important to note that our guidance range includes this assumption. Recent constructive results along with past rulings are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and it gives us confidence we are pursuing the right strategy. Moving on to other developments, there are two issues related to our company-owned life insurance program, also known as COLI. The first and most significant issue is the actual IRS dispute, the second issue is the potential accounting pronouncement from FASB, which affect accounting recognition but not the actual cash flows. I’ll start with the IRS dispute. There have been no new developments on the legal side in our dispute with the IRS. Litigation is currently proceeding with discovery with the trail to be held sometime in early 2007. Because the decisions reached following that trial can be appealed, it maybe another 2 to 3 years before the litigation is finally concluded. There was a new development in the DOW-IRS-COLI dispute. In 2003, DOW won and COLI lost it against the IRS. The IRS appealed the decision. In January 2006, in a split decision, The Sixth Circuit Court reversed the DOW decision and ruled in favor of the IRS. While, this is a new development, we don’t feel it has much bearing on our case, and let me explain why. We had analyzed the impact of the DOW decision on our pending COLI litigation and concluded that there are significant factual differences. As we said before, we believe the outcome of COLI is very fact specific and we believe our facts are stronger than the facts in the DOW case. The good news about the DOW decision is the majority we affirm that satisfying the 4/7 test (ph) is a safe harbor for interest deductions. The 4/7 test is an objective standard, which we are clearly satisfy. In addition the majority opinion in DOW outlined three indicators that will test the economic substance. These indicators are positive pre-deduction cash flows, mortality gains and the built-up of cash values. The court found that DOW’s COLI plans possess none of these indicators of economic substance. We believe it’s only necessary to possess one of these indicators. Of prime these three indicators of economic substance in Xcel Energy’s COLI case demonstrates that our plans were projected to have sizable pre-deduction cash flows based upon the relevant assumptions on purchase, that our plans presented the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively, Xcel Energy’s COLI had no provision giving back any mortality gains that it might realize, and that our plans of large cash value increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first 7 years of these policies. We continue to believe our case has strong merits and feel confident about our facts and circumstances. Now let me touch you on the FASB issues. During the last few months the FASB board has had several meetings and made the following decisions. First, the FASB decided to use an asset model approach with a more likely than not reorganization threshold. That means a company can report the tax benefit as long as there is a greater than 50% probability that the company will ultimately prevail in recognizing the tax benefits. Second, FASB also decided on the implementation table, which for us would mean an effective date of 2007. While we will need to review the final interpretation and continue to monitor other COLI developments, at this time we believe we will be able to continue to book the COLI tax benefits on a financial reporting basis and we will not be required to establish any reserves. A change in topic. Earlier this month we closed on the sale of Seren’s Minnesota assets to Charter Communications. Our divestiture of Seren is now complete. Looking at other developments, within our utility operations, in January temperatures were significantly warmer than normal in all of our service territories. Our preliminary analysis indicates that our earnings will be reduced by $0.03 for warmer than normal January weather. While it only represents one month of the year, it is something you should be aware of as you prepare your first quarter estimates. Let me also give you an update on our coal supply situation. As you’re probably aware delivery of coal from the Powder River basin has been disrupted by various factors including deteriorated rail track in Wyoming. Unfortunately recent deliveries have not improved and it doesn’t appear to be a short-term trend. As a result we may need to continue with periodic mitigation strategies to preserve coal inventory at certain plants. The coal situation could potentially put downward pressure on the ECA incentive mechanism in Colorado. Clearly it still early in the year and we will keep you posted on the situation. For the last couple of years we have been accruing from customer refunds in Colorado related to the SETI measurement under the quality of service program known as QSP. In 2005 we accrued approximately $8 million, which represents $13 million accrual for 2005 and $5 million credit to adjust the accruals related to 2004 performance. I am pleased to report that the Colorado Commission recently approved a QSP settlement. As a result, PSQ will not accrue any reliability penalties for 2006 assuming we invest $11 million in incremental capital to improve reliability. We consider this settlement a true win-win for our customers and our shareholders. So with that I wrap things up. Overall in 2005, we made good progress in laying the foundation for future growth. With January under our belt we’ve had some positive developments with the recent decisions in the Wisconsin and Colorado Rate Cases. On the other side of the ledger we had some unseasonably warm weather and continued coal delivery issues. All in all we remain on track to deliver our 2006 earning range guidance of $1.25 to $1.34 per share from continuing operations. That is $1.25 to $1.35 per share, I had misspelled there. So with that let us open it up for questions.
Operator:
Operator Instructions: Your first question is from the line of David Parker, with Robert W. Baird.
Q - David Parker: Hi, good morning everyone. The question is on the Minnesota Rate Cases, is there a potential, or if you comment on the potential for settlement in that case or expect it to develop to the normal course?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well we are just, I think we are in the discovery process now, so the settlement is always possible, but we do expect if it goes to the normal course that we have a decision, Dave, in the third quarter of this year.
Q - David Parker: Okay, so what you are looking for is probably a pull together, at least make initial rate case filed and then see where it goes from there, is that what we should expect?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yeah.
Q - David Parker: Okay, and can you quantify, you just talked about the positives on the Colorado customers service thing, what would that be earnings per share kind of positive in ’06 versus ’05?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well, we have been accruing some pretty significant penalties under the SETI measurements. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the accrual for 2005 with $30 million, prior year we had a significant accrual to, I can’t remember the exact, I think it’s $11 million. So, Dave we think that is real positive development, we put steel in the ground, replace cables, fix some things that have been causing the problem, get recovery of that $11 million and not have the penalties accruing. You know - I think its real sign of constructive regulatory treatment.
Q - David Parker: Yeah, I agree. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from line of Paul Ridzon with Keybanc Capital Mkts/ McDonald.
A - Benjamin Fowke: Hi Paul.
Q – Paul Ridzon: Good morning, how are you?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Good.
Q – Paul Ridzon: Could you kind of quantify the ongoing level of rail disruptions kind of on a percentage of, what you normally would expect to receive?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Yes, since the disruptions started in May of last year, our deliveries have been basically about 80% of what we have nominated. And that trend pretty much has continued, sometimes it’s up, sometimes it’s down throughout the course. And you know, it is frustrating for us, we really thought we would see the deliveries being closer to a 100% of the nomination as we entered the winter season with some significant track repair behind us. But that’s not what’s happening. And as I mentioned, the railroads are telling us that we can expect some more delivery disruptions going forward, potentially.
Q – Paul Ridzon: And kind of where does that leave your stock piles?
A - Benjamin Fowke: On a consolidated basis we are at, we averaged 23 days but there is some significant variance plant to plant, so what we had hoped to see Paul, in this winter season that we would actually be building the coal piles up in the more to the line of the 30-day range with not so much variances plant to plant and that hasn’t happened to date. We continue to work on it, one of the things we did on our end was to lease significant number of brand new aluminum rail cars. They are lighter, they can carry, I think it is 28% more coal than a typical steel rail car that will help, but you know the bottomline is, we need the delivery should be more equal to what we are nominating.
Q – Paul Ridzon: And as you mentioned weather would be milder, is there any besides from regulatory sales, is there any potential offset that you are seeing with free capacity being able to market that in an increasingly gas priced market?
A - Benjamin Fowke: That is a great question, typically it will depend on market conditions. Keep in mind that we have seen some, the gas prices have softened as we entered ’06, but typically if your retail load is lighter than you expected, it does create some opportunities to sell more of your generation into the market. That’s what happened primarily in December of just last year. It created some nice short-term margins for us, but you need out of market condition to cooperate at the same time.
Q – Paul Ridzon: And to what extent are you forced to limit that type of opportunities in the name of creating stock piles?
A - Benjamin Fowke: Well its, I think what you are referring to, if you don’t have as much coal resources, because you are either conserving or in the case what I have mentioned in the remarks, our King plant is being retrofitted as part of the Merck product. If you don’t have coal resources then you potentially can’t take advantage of those opportunities as well as we have in the past.
Q – Paul Ridzon: And then just, in Colorado on the $30 million accrual for SETI, that you expect that to fully go away?
A - Benjamin Fowke: In ’06 we do, yes.
Q – Paul Ridzon: Okay, that is net ’05 earnings?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Yes, it is. That was a net 8 million because we had some adjustments for ’04, but that is the level of the accrual.
Q – Paul Ridzon: Is that pre-tax or after-tax?
A – Benjamin Fowke: That is pre.
Q – Paul Ridzon: Thank you, very much, that’s all my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Parrella with Merrill lynch.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about your retail sales, especially the residential sales, in which even on the weather to normalize basis we are pretty weak in 2005, and I know you have mentioned kind of the impact on consumption patterns from higher power prices particularly in Colorado. But wondering if you could just review with us, whether there is some other factors at work and is that something we should expect to continue into ’06?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Well it’s a good question, Elizabeth. We continue to look at it, the sale, we did – you’ve recalled we did bring our sales assumption down in 2005 from our initial guidance, 2006 reflects what we were seeing in 2005, so we are comfortable with that assumption, there might be some conservation going on but we don’t think we are seeing significant demand destruction. What we have done, Elizabeth, is examine some of the fundamental economic indicators, you know housing, startups, unemployment, etc. And it is just a pretty good economy, so with the exception of gas sales that we do think we are seeing demand destruction, we don’t see that trend on the electric side. One of the things to keep in the mind is that we had a pretty warm summer in 2005, it was proceeded by a pretty mild summer in 2004. Sometimes our weather normalization model don’t capture that maybe as well as they should, we are looking at that. We don’t see if see a significant long-term trend, we are not concerned about overall decline in electric sales. But we are going to watch it.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: And also you mentioned what the bad debt expense number was in 2005, I think it was $48 million? Is it comparable 2004 number?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Yes, we think 2006 bad debt expense will fall off to about $35 million. 2004 was at the $28-29 million level. So we are kind of splitting the difference there, two things to think about, Elizabeth. We will continue to be in a high fuel environment, so we do think bad debt expense, it will continue to be relatively high. But we don’t think we will see bad debt expense at the level of 2005 for two factors. One, that kind of it was a rush we think for some of our customers to get ahead of the new bankruptcy laws. The new ones I guess are more conservative. And the second thing is, internally, we put a lot more focus and attention on our processes and I am confident that’s going to pay some dividend for us in ’06.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Okay. And one last question if I may. Do you have the, where operating cash flow and CapEx came in for ’05 and how that might have compared with your projections?
A – Benjamin Fowke: It came in pretty close to our projections, cash from operation on a total basis was $1.2 billion and cash from continuing operation was $1.1 billion. CapEx came in about what we were thinking too, Elizabeth, at $1.3 billion.
Q - Elizabeth Parrella: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Hsang with Citigroup.
A – Benjamin Fowke: Hi, Steven.
Q - Stephen Hsang: Hi, good morning. Question I had here was on back to the PRD question. With the delays continuingly going on right now, you guys don’t anticipate then based on what you are seeing, that you will be able to get back to that more or less 30 days, kind of above stock pile before summer?
A – Benjamin Fowke: We are going to do everything we can to get back to that 30 days. That’s where we would like to be and we are working very closely with the railroads to get the nominations that we want, but it is an issue for us and that’s why, if we can’t get the deliveries we might have to continue to do some mitigations. That, it follows going 2005.
Q - Stephen Hsang: That reminds me, with the mitigation plan, does that include going into the market and buying purchase power?
A – Benjamin Fowke: It includes that, it includes in some cases switching from coal to gas, we have that ability in some of our plants to do that. It includes changing some of the dispatch orders, so essentially we are not using your coal plants as much as you will, you are using gas plants as an alternative to save coal.
Q - Stephen Hsang: Alright. And the new rate case there, is that more of that federal approved or the like, can you just remind me where can you get trued up on the purchase power, is that all your jurisdiction or are there areas where you still going to eat the cost?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Well, those purchases, are you talking about purchase that we might make for coal mitigation?
Q - Stephen Hsang: Right, for a customer.
A – Benjamin Fowke: Those would be considered energy purchases and they would flow through the fuel cost, I think you are familiar with that fuel cost recovery mechanisms.
Q - Stephen Hsang: Basically, all that really is that your potential all systems sales, which has declined significantly if you were to go back into mitigation for this year?
A – Benjamin Fowke: It could impact that, yes.
Q - Stephen Hsang: Okay. And then the January weather, was just the $0.03 you are talking primarily due to the gas business, right?
A – Benjamin Fowke: It’s gas and some electric. I mean there is, I mean, when you kick on your furnace there is some electric component to that. It’s really been I think I read in the paper here its one that’s Minnesota we are now 160 years, I haven’t lived in Minnesota that long but I don’t think it typically rained in January, and it did in my house couple of nights ago.
Q - Stephen Hsang: And, but you guys aren’t changing your weekend sales forecast because of any of that, I mean I know you have worked in all places?
A – Benjamin Fowke: No, no we are not.
Q - Stephen Hsang: Okay, all right great thank you.
Operator: Once again if you’d like to ask a question please press “*” then your number “1” on your telephone keypad. The next question is from the line of Maura Shaughnessy with MFS.
A – Benjamin Fowke: Hi.
Q – Maura Shaughnessy: Good morning. Just hoping on this coal issue again, I guess we talked about the rails there, incidentally more offbeat than the reality that you guys are portraying, what is the issue since it’s been on the highlight so to speak since last spring. What is the problem that has created the continuation of this theme?
A – Benjamin Fowke: I wish we could get more of some of their offbeatness in the form of coal with relative to our plans and that’s really what we want. You know originally it was the deteriorated rail track, which meant that the cars have to slow down significantly, they did a lot of work on those tracks prior to winter. When winter sets in what we were anticipating based upon conversations with the railroads that the track will basically firm up because of the frozen ground and we could pretty much expect normal deliveries but that hasn’t happened, there been a number of issues that the railroads have talked about mines, issues with mining, labor, what have you, but most recently they’ve mentioned that there is more to demand than there is supply. And that’s why we’ve reported that we have to continue the look at this. I think we’ve done absolutely everything we can, working with our commissions to do that. But we need the coal from the railroads and we’re going to do everything we can to get it.
Q – Maura Shaughnessy: And setting forth your guidance for ‘06, this was known in terms of the coal inventory situation when that guidance was set. How should we think about you know there was some offsets probably the rate cases when better than expected or what have you that you didn’t materially change guidance despite the situation on the fuel side. How should we think about that?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Well, we’ve had some ups and downs, I mean the thing down mostly is whether we continue to execute on our regulatory plan and that’s what I believe drives long-term growth for us. On the coal side the thing that we’ll be watching and will be working real hard to mitigate is the potential impact it could have on ECA recovery mix, incentive mechanism in Colorado, we’ve earned pretty much at close to the top of that incentive mechanism, which is $11 million pretax over the last couple of years. The mitigation, this overall increases in coal prices, that is going to put some downward pressure on that. It’s one of several different variables.
Q – Maura Shaughnessy: Okay great, good luck.
A – Benjamin Fowke: Thank you.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Elisabeth Parrella with Merrill Lynch.
Q – Elisabeth Parrella: Just a little follow-up on the last question actually, how much did you earn under the Colorado incentive mechanism in 2005, because I thought at one point you were building in something that was fairly neutral but it sounds like maybe you did a little better than you have expected?
A – Benjamin Fowke: We did, we came out at $8.5 million, Elisabeth for ‘05.
Q – Elisabeth Parrella: Okay. And in terms of your guidance have you build-in sort of a similar amount or…?
A – Benjamin Fowke: Well the first thing is that the guidance is what we came out in the third quarter $1.25 to $1.35, which is just one of the multiple variables that we look at. I tell you the biggest sensitivity obviously is the Minnesota electric rate case and that’s the one I think ultimately swings the needle the most.
Q – Elisabeth Parrella: Okay thank you.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions.
Benjamin Fowke, Vice President and CFO: Alright, well I want to thank everybody for participating on the call this morning, look forward to meeting many of you throughout the year. As a reminder if you have any follow-up questions, Dick Kaufman and Paul Johnson will be available to take your calls. Thank you.

===== 2005 Q3  (2005-10-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning.  My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xcel Energy Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call.
Operator Instructions: I will now turn the call over to Mr. Richard Kolkmann, Managing Director, Investors Relations.  Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Kolkmann: Thanks, Dennis, and I would like to welcome all of you to Xcel Energy's third quarter 2005 earnings release conference call.  With me today is Ben Fowke, Vice President and CFO of Xcel Energy.  We also have several others here to help provide answers to your questions. Some of the comments that will be made contain forward-looking information, significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and Xcel Energy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I will turn the call over to Ben.
Ben Fowke: Thanks, Dick, and welcome everyone.  On today's call, I'm going to provide an explanation of our quarterly results, our outlook for the rest of year, our 2006 guidance and finally an update on our construction program in COLI. Starting with our results for the quarter, I'm pleased to report that Xcel Energy recorded earnings from continuing operations of $0.47 per share for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $0.40 per share for 2004.  Total earnings for the third quarter 2005 were $0.47 per share, compared with $0.12 per share for 2004.  As a reminder, we recorded a loss of $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2004, largely due to an asset impairment charge related to our Seren investment. As you know, the core of our company is our utilities subsidiaries, which provided earnings of $0.46 per share for the third quarter 2005, compared with $0.41 per share for 2004.  Utility earnings increased by $0.05 per share, largely due to higher electric utility margins which increased earnings by $0.10 per share and income tax benefits, which increased earnings by about $0.03 per share. These favorable results were partially offset by lower short-term wholesale and trading margins, higher utility O & M expenses, higher depreciation expense, and various other items.  Each of these items decreased earnings by $0.02 per share individually, or $0.08 per share in total. Our holding company costs and results of other non-regulated companies provided earnings of $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2005, compared with a loss of $0.01 per share last year.  The change is primarily due to temporary timing differences related to accounting for income taxes under GAAP and our own reporting guidance.  That summarizes our third quarter results. Now let's look into the details of the quarter. Starting at the top of the income statement, our base electric utility margins increased by $70 million for the quarter, largely driven by warm summer temperatures and weather-adjusted sales growth.  In the third quarter of 2005, we benefited from temperatures in most of our major jurisdictions that were warmer than normal and significantly warmer than last year. In Minnesota, temperature humidity degree days were 26% above normal and 49% above 2004.  In Colorado, cool degree days were 29% above normal and 86% above 2004.  And finally, in the Texas Panhandle, cool degree days were 2% above normal, and 23% above 2004.  As a result, favorable weather increased electric utility margins by $53 million, or $0.08 per share. In addition to favorable weather conditions, weather adjusted retail electric sales grew at 1.4%, increasing electric margin by $11 million.  On a year-to-date basis, our weather-adjusted retail electric sales also increased by 1.4%.  This is below our expectations for the year, and we have revised our year-end electric sales growth guidance range downward to 1.3% to 1.6%.  We think the lower sales growth is a result of economic conditions and higher fuel prices.  For more information on electric margins, please refer to our earnings release. Turning to operating expenses, our third quarter 2005, O & M expenses were $22 million higher than last year.  The increase in O & M expenses was largely driven by higher benefit costs, accruals for various legal settlements and inventory adjustments. Overall, our year-to-date O & M expenses are about 6.5% higher than last year.  When we experienced hot weather during the summer, we took the opportunity to increase our O & M expense levels to ensure that our operating system was in good shape.  Compared with our original plans, we now expect our annual O & M spending to increase at our energy supply business unit. In addition, we also expect bad debt accruals to increase.  We believe the increase in bad debt expense reflects a slowdown in the economy and the recent change in bankruptcy laws.  Finally we recently made a donation to help our customers manage high-energy bills.  As a result, I now expect our annual 2005 O & M expenses to increase to approximately by 5% compared with last year. Depreciation expense for the third quarter of 2005 was $13 million higher than 2004 levels.  This is a continuation of a trend that we expected for the year.  The increase is due to growth associated with normal system expansion and incremental depreciation for several large projects, including a new steam generator at Prairie Island and a new billing system.  We expect recovery of these investments in future rate filings. During the quarter, we recognized approximately $11 million of income tax benefits, largely associated with prior periods.  The benefits consisted primarily of research tax credits and a net operating loss carry back.  As a result of these benefits, we have modified our effective tax rate assumptions to a range of 25% to 27% for 2005.  That covers our earnings results for the quarter. Let me touch upon our year-end outlook.  While we have modified some of our individual assumptions as detailed in our earnings release, our 2005 guidance range from earnings from continuing operations, remains at $1.18, to $1.28 per share.  Through the first nine months we have benefited from warm weather and tax benefits, but these positive variations have been offset by higher O & M expense and lower sales growth.  Based on the year-to-date results and our projections for the last quarter, we have narrowed the range and expect to end up in the lower half of our guidance range. Let's look ahead to next year.  We are initiating our 2006 guidance range for earnings from continuing operations at $1.25, to $1.35 per share.  Our 2006 assumptions are detailed in our earnings release. I'm going to spend a bit of time on two assumptions that are the most difficult to handicap.  The realized revenue from our rate filings and the potential impact of high fuel costs.  In 2005, we have or will file several rate cases as part of our regulatory strategy. In May, we filed a natural gas rate case in Colorado, requesting a $34 million rate increase, based on a return of equity of 11%.  In June, we filed an electric and natural gas rate case in Wisconsin, requesting an electric rate increase of $53 million, and a gas rate increase of $8 million, based on a return of equity of 11.9%. Next week, we will file an electric rate case in Minnesota.  Finally, later in November, we will file an electric rate case in North Dakota. As far as the timing of the rate cases, we expect a final decision in Colorado and Wisconsin cases at the end of this year, or the beginning of next year, with final rates in effect in early 2006.  In both Minnesota and North Dakota, we will implement interim rates subject to a refund, which will be effective 60 days after the filing.  We expect a final decision in both Minnesota and North Dakota in the summer of 2006. Now I know you have lots of questions about the Minnesota rate case.  Since we haven't filed the case yet, I can't provide too much detail.  After the filing is made, we will provide you with more details at the EEI meeting in early November.  There are a couple things I can tell you.  Overall, we expect to increase rates 7 to 9%. Approximately 61 million of the request is for decommissioning accruals; however, we are going to present various proposals to extend the collection period, which may lower the revenue requirements and the decommissioning accruals but will have no impact on earnings or cash flow. We are also looking at a different design to short-term wholesale margins, which would incorporate a sharing approach.  This would provide us with an incentive and allow the ratepayers to share in the upside potential.  We are requesting an 11% return on equity. Any time you file a rate case, there are regulatory risks.  Clearly we are concerned about the high impact, the impact of high fuel prices on our customers; however, there are several key points to our case.  We have increased investments to meet expanding customer needs and improve reliability.  We have competitive rates, which are the result of careful cost management and two mergers, which allowed us to reduce our costs and avoid filing rate cases.  Finally, we are environmentally responsible and lead the industry in developing renewables, promoting energy efficiency and reducing emissions. Our strategy is to file reasonable rate cases and get recovery of legitimate investments and expenses.  We believe that our commission will provide us with reasonable recovery and it's important to note in our guidance range that we assume to get reasonable rate recovery. Another area of uncertainty is the impact of high fuel prices on our business.  As you can see in our 2006 assumptions, we are projecting weather-adjusted electric retail sales growth of 1.3% to 1.7%.  This is lower than our historic growth rate, and reflects our estimate of the impact of higher fuel costs on sales.  We think this is a reasonable assumption, but it's very difficult to determine what impact $13 to $14 natural gas prices will have on customer usage.  We will be closely monitoring this situation. In addition, we expect that higher fuel prices will increase working capital.  We are in the process of expanding our credit facilities by $275 million to enhance our liquidity position.  Increases in working capital will have some impact on our interest expense. Finally, higher fuel costs will potentially impact our bad debt expense.  We have seen some impact in 2005, and we think our 2006 budget captures the potential exposure, but current prices are beyond historic levels and may provide our projections inaccurate. Overall, I think we have done a good job of capturing the impact of regulatory risk and higher fuel prices on our budget.  I'm very comfortable with our guidance range but we are aware of the potential sensitivities.  In addition to our 2006 earnings guidance, we have also updated our five-year capital expenditure forecast outlook as detailed in the earnings release. The forecast is not materially different from what you have seen in the past; however, we will continue to look at additional opportunities to invest in our utility business, particularly in the later years of our forecast.  We will work very hard to obtain regulatory and legislative support necessary to make those investments attractive to our investors.  If the past is any indication, for example, projects like Merck and Comanche 3, we will be successful. Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our major construction projects in COLI.  We continue to make outstanding progress on the development of our new coal plant in Colorado.  Permitting for construction of Comanche 3 is now complete.  All environmental permits are in hand. Water rights have been obtained, county road access has been authorized and an annexation agreement with the City of Pueblo has been approved. Additionally a permit for ash disposal site was granted.  And building permit applications will submitted as the project proceeds.  In terms of project construction, oiler, turbine, air quality control systems, site development and stack contracts have been awarded, and the costs are in line with our expectations. At the site, the evaporation pond removal is complete, the stack foundation work has begun, and the site development contractor has begun preparing the site for construction.  We expect to have the formal ground breaking ceremony later this year. We have also made good progress on the Merc project.  We broke ground for the King plant rehabilitation project in April of this year.  Details design work is nearly 70% complete, and approximately 90% of the contracts for equipment supply and construction have been placed. A large use of the long lead components like boiler, turbine and pollution control equipment have been designed and are well into manufacturing.  The pilings, foundation and slabs for the new pollution control equipment and cooling towers will be completed by year-end.  I'm happy to report that both projects remain on track and within our cost expectations. So now let me touch on everybody's favorite topic, our company-owned life insurance program known as COLI.  As I mentioned in the past, there are two issues related to COLI, the first and most significant issue is the actual IRS dispute.  The second issue is the potential accounting pronouncement from the FASB, which affects accounting recognition, but not actual cash flows. I will start with the IRS dispute.  In October, the district court denied our motion for summary judgment in the IRS dispute.  The court also denied the IRS motion for summary judgment, which asserted that PSCo had no insurable interest in the lives of its employees.  The court did grant partial summary judgment to us, affirming that we had an insurable interest in the lives of our employees. A ruling and summary judgment is issued if there are no disputed issues of material fact.  Generally speaking, it is difficult to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, so the denial of our motion is understandable.  In this situation, the court decided that it would need a full hearing to determine the case, because questions of fact remain. We are pleased that the court affirmed that we have an insurable interest in the lives of our employees, litigation is currently proceeding with discovery and with the trial to be held sometime after 2006.  We do not have a specific date yet for the beginning of the trial.  Because the decision reached following that trial can be appealed, it may be another two to three years before the litigation is finally concluded.  In any event, we believe our case has strong merits and we feel confident about our facts and circumstances. Now, let me touch on the FASB issue.  In September, the common period expired on the FASB exposure draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions.  There are more are than 100 comment letters submitted and many letters indicated significant opposition to the new rules.  The FASB has since announced that the effective date of the potential new rules has been delayed until at least the first quarter of 2006. At this point, we believe there's considerable uncertainty about the FASB's eventual decision on this issue.  They could revise rules, continue to delay the project, issue a completely new exposure draft or abandon the project.  As a result, we will continue to record the tax benefits of COLI in our actual results and we'll continue to include the tax benefits in our guidance range. So with that, I will wrap things up.  Overall, it was a good quarter.  We are on track to meet our 2005 guidance, and our 2006 guidance represents excellent growth prospects.  We have a solid strategy , one that works for us.  Our build to core strategy is not changing, it is easy to understand, and it is low risk.  Invest in our utility business, earn original return on that investment. We continue to balance and align the interests and the needs of our customers, the environment and our shareholders.  Like any plan, it has its challenges, and the high-priced fuel environment will require Xcel Energy and its stakeholders to be forward looking. We have developed an action plan, which we shared with the public recently.  Part of the plan includes donations of $5 million to the Salvation Army's Heat Share program, and other local programs in our service territories.  We have also made significant investments in our utilities to improve reliability, increase capacity and reduce emissions. Clearly this increased investment is driving the case for rate cases over the next few years.  Fair regulatory treatment will ensure that we can continue to make long-term investments that will benefit our customers.  We recognize that it's important to be customer focused.  Our view is that if we take care of our customers, our shareholders will benefit. So with that, let's open the lines up for questions.
