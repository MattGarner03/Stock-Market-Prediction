===== 2025 Q2  (2025-05-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now hand today's call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Meziere : Thank you, Tamika. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2025 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 29 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal '25 net income of $837 million or $5.26 per diluted share. We updated our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.20 to $7.30. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to 3.4 million customers across 1,400 communities in 8 states. For the quarter, we continued to experience robust growth driven by continually favorable employment trends in Texas. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2025, we added nearly 59,000 new customers with almost 46,000 of those new customers located in Texas. The Texas Workforce Commission reported in April that seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.3 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months ending March adding nearly 192,000 jobs, representing a 1.4% annual growth rate. Commercial customer growth remained solid as well with approximately 850 customers connecting to the system during the second quarter and nearly 2,000 customers connecting to the system fiscal year-to-date. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 9 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 8 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 20 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 11 Bcf once they're fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that is equivalent to adding approximately 204,000 residential customers. This growth continues to highlight the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territories. In APT, we continue our work on several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system as well as support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. During the quarter, work started on Phase 2 of APT's Line WA Loop. This project will install approximately 44 miles of 36-inch pipe to the west of Fort Worth to support growth in the northwestern portion of the DFW Metroplex. This phase is expected to be completed by the end of the calendar year. Work continues on APT's Bethel to Groesbeck project as well. As a reminder, this project will install approximately 55 miles of 36-inch pipe from our Bethel storage facility to our Groesbeck compressor station to provide additional pipeline capacity to the growing DFW Metroplex and to the Interstate 35 corridor. This project is scheduled to be placed in service late calendar year 2025. APT completed 2 more interconnect projects during the quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, APT has added over 1 Bcf of additional gas supplies that will enhance supply reliability and versatility to support APT LDC customers. During the second quarter, our customers support associates and service technicians once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers, reflecting the exceptional customer service they provide each and every day. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Through those efforts, the team helped nearly 32,000 customers receive over $10 million in funding assistance. Our results for the first half of fiscal '25 reflect the hard work and dedication of all Atmos Energy employees as we continue to safely deliver reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As Kevin mentioned, diluted earnings per share for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was $5.26 represents a 6.7% increase over the prior year period. Operating income increased to $1.1 million or 14.6% for the first 6 months of the fiscal year. I'll highlight the key drivers of our financial performance. Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $185 million. Residential commercial customer growth in our distribution segment, combined with higher industrial load, increased operating income by an additional $14.4 million. Revenues in our Pipeline and Storage segment increased $11.4 million, reflecting a 10% increase in volumes transported across our system, combined with wider spreads between the Waha Header and the Western end of APT system and delivered points on the Eastern end and southern end of its system. APT also experienced an $8 million increase due to higher capacity contracted by tariff-based customers due to their growing peak day demand. Consolidated O&M expense increased $74 million. This increase was driven by several factors. Employee-related costs increased approximately $27 million primarily due to increased headcount and overtime to support company growth. Additionally, bad debt expense increased $15 million. As a reminder, we recognized a $14 million nonrecurring reduction in bad debt expense last fiscal year, resulted from a regulatory change on how we recover our bed debt expenses specific. We also experienced a $14 million increase in O&M associated with higher levels of line locating, pipeline inspection and system monitoring activities. Finally, we experienced a $9.4 million increase in APT system safety and integrity expense, which is offset by a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in no impact to operating income. From a regulatory perspective, we have implemented approximately $153 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we currently have over $389 million in progress. Of this amount, we anticipate implementing between $175 million and $180 million of annualized operating income increases in fiscal '25 with the remainder expected to be implemented in the first quarter of fiscal '26. Included in this amount is $39.2 million requested in our West Texas general rate case. On April 25, the administrative law judge issued a proposal precision with the following key recommendations. A 9.8% return on equity, actual capital structure, which reflects a 60.97% equity layer, approved over rate base totaling $1.2 billion, approval capitalized cloud computing costs as fixed assets recovered over a 15-year period, which essentially treat these costs as a capital expenditure rather than O&M line items and the authorization of 2 regulatory asset trackers. The first is the system safety integrity regulatory asset that allow us to defer O&M incurred after June 30, 2024, in excess of $3.5 million related to system, safety, integrity regulations adopted by Rail Commission and Vesa. These costs will be considered for recovery in a future rate filing. The segment provides for regulatory asset or liability treatment that capture the effects of changes in federal and state income taxes, including the corporate alternative minimum tax. The proposed precision is scheduled be considered by the Railroad Commission on May 13. If approved as filed, the settlement would result in a $30.6 million increase in annual operating income. In our Mid-Tex division, the 2 general rate cases we filed last fall for the ATM Cities Coalition and our environs customers were consolidated into 1 general rate case during the second fiscal quarter. As a reminder, this consolidated case represents approximately 15% of the Mid-Tex division's customer base. On April 30, we filed with the administrative law judge, a proposed settlement on this consolidated case. The key terms of the proposed settlement, ROE, capital structure and the accounting treatments I just described and the same as what is included in the West Texas disposal decision. Additionally, the recommendation includes approval of rate base allocable to these customers and approximately $1.1 billion. If the Ministry of Law Judge recommends a settlement for approval, we anticipate the settlement to be scheduled for consideration by the Rail Commission on June 10. If approved as filed, the segment will result in a $6.7 million increase in annual operating income. Additionally, we expect the Rail Commission will also consider APT's 2024 GRIP line for $77.2 million at its June 10 meeting. Finally, in Kentucky, we completed here in this week before the Public Service Commission regarding our general rate case. We anticipate a final order during our fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and financial position remains strong. Our equity capitalization as of March 31 was 61%, and we do not any short-term debt outstanding. During the second quarter, we extended our 4 credit facilities totaling $3.1 billion. At quarter end, we had $5.3 billion in available liquidity to support our operations. Included in this amount is $1.7 billion of net proceeds available from our ATM activities which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal '25 equity needs and all of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal '26. Our fiscal year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance from a range of $7.05 to $7.25 to a new range of $7.20 to $7.30. We expect the remaining contribution to fiscal 2025 earnings per share to be recognized somewhat evenly by quarter in the back half of the fiscal year. The increase of our guidance largely reflects the strength of APT's through-system business during the first half of the fiscal year and our expectations for this part of APT's business for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, following a strong fiscal '24 performance, we entered fiscal '25, assuming a return to more normalized through-system marketing conditions as a result of increased takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin. Now we currently expect APT through-system business performed just slightly less than the prior year. However, the timing of these revenues in fiscal '25 is expected to be different than in fiscal '24. Through March 31, about half of the expected contribution for fiscal 2025 from this portion of APT's business has already be recognized. In the prior year, nearly 80% of APT's through-system business was recognized in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, we anticipate ad valorem taxes to be lower than planned and has increased our O&M spending to stay ahead of compliance work to further enhance the safety and reliability of our system. We will also perform some additional makes this summer to prepare for the upcoming winter heating season. We now anticipate our O&M, excluding bad debt expense, to be in the range of $860 million to $880 million. A significant portion of the year-over-year increase has already been recognized, and we anticipate O&M in the back half of fiscal '25 to be just slightly higher than in the same period in the prior year. Finally, our capital guidance -- capital spending guidance remains on track to be approximately $3.7 billion. We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. I'll now open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.
Richard Sunderland : Appreciate all the commentary here. I wanted to start with guidance. It sounds like APT through-system activity certainly contributing to some of the upside here, is the higher guidance for 2025 a fair base to think about growth going forward? Or does some of that normalization that you had originally anticipated for '25 need to be factored in for growth for '26 and beyond?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. It's a good question, Rich. So we'll still figure looking at what will happen for the rest of the summer. As you know, conditions are very volatile in the market right now. And as we set our fiscal '26 plans, we'll take a snapshot of market conditions, probably late summer, early fall, prior to us releasing our fiscal '26 guidance and updated 5-year plan to really reflect what we think will be truly reflective of that business for the next fiscal year.
Richard Sunderland : Okay. Got it. Sounds like more to come. Again, similarly on the O&M, it seemed like some of the higher O&M for '25 is a pull forward from '26. Is that a fair characterization? How are you thinking about the higher O&M this year and any efforts that derisk '26 on that front?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. A couple of things. There's certainly an opportunity to pull forward as I described with the lower-than-planned expense vis-a-vis our expectations also, we've talked many, many times, we are not a just-in-time company from an O&M spending perspective. So if we have opportunities to further stay ahead of our compliance deadlines or if we see opportunities coming out of the winter heating season this last 6 months, you need to get right for the next 6 months, we'll perform some additional maintenance in the summer months when our crews and folks are available. So it's a little bit of both. It's just kind of opportunistic based on the operating conditions of the system at this point in time as well as taking advantage of opportunities to pull forward a little bit from future periods.
Kevin Akers: Yes. The only thing I'll add to that is that, again, with the lesson we have of being in growth properties right now, we had an increase in the number of line located from the previous year. And we'll continue to see that probably going forward, just given the economic conditions that I discussed earlier in my remarks. So that's the other part of that O&M, if you will, sometimes with growth, people don't see that you'll have the increased line locating expense as well.
Richard Sunderland : Got it. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the O&M discussion there. It sounded like in the Texas GRCs that there is some retroactive component to the reg asset tracker you were referencing. I may not be understanding all the puts and takes there. But just wanted to clarify, if you get the final orders in line with settlement, is that upside from that retroactive component and I mean, upside versus '25 guidance, to be clear.
Chris Forsythe: At this point, we reflected in our guidance, our expectations for O&M and both the cloud computing treatments as well as the SSI current guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays.
Fei She: This is actually Fei for Nick today. I just want to quickly follow up on financing. It seems like year-to-date equity issuance slightly higher than year-to-date 2024. Again, I think with higher capital plan, higher rate base growth, can you update us on the equity financing for the rest of the year, if there is any changes from the messaging from last quarter? And also kind of seeing the interest rate swap to be in a similar spot as last quarter. Just generally, can you speak to the strategy, managing the costs over there as well?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. This is Chris. So I mean, our financing strategy hasn't changed since prior quarter or really for the last several years, we'll continue to finance the corporation in a balanced fashion using a combination of equity long-term debt with equity coming through the ATM. We talked about it had a $1.7 billion on the page now that's been priced to reflect our equity needs -- our anticipated equity for fiscal '25 as well as 2026. And we'll draw that down as the cash needs via corporation dictate when we need to use that. Additionally, from a long-term debt perspective, you know the swap that we have in place That's, again, tied to our anticipated debt issuance in the fall for anticipating a 30 year issues at this point in time. So at this point, we don't see any changes in executing that particularly that transaction, and utilizing that swap for the benefit of our customers.
Fei She : Got it. That's very helpful. And I just want to follow up on economic development, and seeing the tremendous growth in Texas driven by C&I customers. Could you talk about, first of all, definitely generally need a gas need in the region. And obviously, you're adding a large quantity of new gas demand each quarter. I guess at this point, is there any pipeline of projects you're working on or if there's any quantifiable backlog that you can discuss? I'll leave it there.
Kevin Akers: Yes. I'm not sure about your question on backlog. We don't have a backlog per se. I talked about the 2 high-priority projects for APT, the WA Loop and Bethel to Groesbeck project right now. Additionally, we're finishing up work on our third salt-dome cavern as part of our integrity maintenance program. We anticipate that to be ramping up sometime in the next 9 to 12-month period that's out there. Everything else is all scheduled work that we have lined out on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis according to the reliability, supply versatility and/or our risk model safety concerns or direction that way. Now, as we have in our slide deck, we point to 85% investment on capital for safety, reliability for the fiscal year-to-date period.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Julian Dumoulin, Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Park on for Julian. Just really quick, legislatively, just wondering what are some of the key builds you guys monetary and what potential benefits or implications do they carry for your business? Like, for example, we noticed there's HB-4384 regarding the standalone depreciation tracker for gas LDCs, do you see that as a potential benefit for your business? Just any color on that 1 would be helpful.
Kevin Akers: Yes. We continue to monitor all the sessions across our 8 states. We have 2 that are currently closed or concluded their session Mississippi and Kentucky. Don't want to get too far ahead of the work that's continued to going on across our legislative bodies right now. But we do see some builds out there that have our interest right now, but we think it needs to go through the final steps of the legislative process. And then if they're related to the utility side of the business, they have to go to that particular jurisdictions commission to see how it falls into either tariffs or rules or action upon for that company. So I don't want to get too far out in front of what the legislature is going to do for the remaining session. But again, we're keeping an eye on everything that's out there.
Unidentified Analyst : That's very clear. And maybe just another housekeeping question. So since you raised the FY '25 EPS guidance, so the new guidance midpoint is now $7.25, should we use the new EPS guidance midpoint as the new EPS base?
Chris Forsythe: When you say new EPS base, what do you mean there?
Unidentified Analyst : Is for calculating the 5-year CAGR?
Chris Forsythe: At this point, I think that's a pretty fair assumption.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Landenberg Bauman.
Paul Fremont: Congratulations on a strong quarter, and my question has been answered.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Christopher Jeffrey with Mizuho Securities.
Christopher Jeffrey : Congrats on a quarter…
Kevin Akers: We can't hear you on this end.
Christopher Jeffrey : Sorry, is that better?
Kevin Akers: That's better.
Christopher Jeffrey : Okay. So just A couple of quick ones from me. I just noticed the timing for the Colorado rate case expectation got pushed back a bit. Just any kind of thoughts on timing there and expectations for when you get to that case?
Kevin Akers: No, that's something we're always looking at. What we have going on in the jurisdiction where we have going on in other jurisdictions, ongoing conversation with our regulatory jurisdiction. So I wouldn't read a lot into that at this point. .
Christopher Jeffrey : Great. And then maybe just on the West Texas, the cloud computing costs that you mentioned, Kevin, in the opening remarks, just kind of expectations for that to be implemented more wholesale across Texas or any other states? Does that kind of change how you're approaching thinking about those types of costs within rate base?
Chris Forsythe: I just kind of view this as a continuation of our ongoing regulatory strategy or seeking to reduce lag where we can. Oftentimes, we'll start with an individual jurisdiction who will includes something into the regulatory construct. We then try to seek to replicate that in other states to the best of our ability. So we'll see where the rail commissions vote comes down next week. And then after that, from the May 13 for West Texas and again from Mid-Tex on June 10. And then we'll see if it makes sense for us to bring that to other jurisdictions within the enterprise.
Christopher Jeffrey : Got it. And just to clarify, so that would be the first jurisdiction that that type of cost is included.
Chris Forsythe: Correct.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citigroup.
Ryan Levine : Just a quick one. In terms of APT expansion projects, the business continues to grow pretty materially. What are the underlying growth assumptions that embed the expansion projects that you have underway? And what conditions would merit further expansion or upside to your existing plants?
Kevin Akers: It's all part of our planning process. Again, it's based on what the city models are and what they're seeing for growth population increases across the service territories, what we're seeing for demand anticipated capacity requirements off of that growth. We put those in our models and then try and forecast out when we expect that demand to show up and make sure we have the pipe and the supply already there to meet those anticipated demands. That's something we go through several times a year and then reaffirm again with our customers what their NVQs are as we head into winter, then post winter on APT will review what actual NVQs they achieved and will reset the go-forward basis, that drives our modeling for the next several years.
Ryan Levine : So given the winner is largely behind us, has that a refresh already occurred for this calendar year, so that we wouldn't expect any material changes until a review post winter 2026 of expansion opportunities?
Kevin Akers: The review is ongoing at this point. We continue to have conversations with those LDCs behind our city gate there on APT, and we'll look to make sure those are reset prior to heading into next heating season, if any adjustments at all are required.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now hand today's call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Dan Meziere : We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us today. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30. Have a good day.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-05 09:00:00) =====
Daniel Meziere: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Christopher Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation we will reference in our prepared remarks are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review our financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide twenty-seven and are more fully described in our SEC filings. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Let's begin today's call by thanking all 5,300 Atmos Energy employees for their focus and dedication to safely serving our customers during very challenging weather conditions. And thank you for all that you do every day for our customers and our community. You're truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported first-quarter net income of $352 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our first fiscal quarter capital spending was $891 million to support continued system modernization and growth across our service territory. Customer growth continued to be solid as for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. We added over 59,000 new customers, with over 46,000 of those located here in Texas. The Texas Workforce Commission reported in January that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.3 million. Texas, once again, added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last twelve months, adding nearly 284,000 jobs in calendar 2024, representing a 2% annual growth rate. Commercial customer growth remained solid as well, with nearly 1,100 commercial customers connecting to the system during the first quarter. We added eleven new industrial customers, which, when fully operational, we anticipate utilizing 2.3 bcf of gas annually. This continued demand from all customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development and fueling the energy demand across our service territories. In APT, we completed several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we see from the local distribution companies behind the APT system. The final phase of our thirty-six-inch line s2 project was placed into service in December 2024. We are now flowing additional supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale play to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. APT's Bethel, the Grow Spec project has started. This project will install approximately fifty-five miles of thirty-six-inch pipe from our Bethel storage facility to our gross deck compressor station, which will provide additional pipeline capacity to transport gas from our Beville storage facility to the growing DSW Metroplex and the interstate thirty-five portal. To enhance supply reliability and system versatility, APT completed two interconnect projects during the quarter. One on our line f2 near Carthage and the second near our growing service territory outside Austin. Our customer support associates and service technicians' satisfaction ratings remain high for the quarter, at 98%. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts with energy assistance agencies and customers during the first quarter, helping over 16,000 customers to save $4 million in funding assistance. Our employees' focus on customer service and process improvement was recognized in December when, for the third consecutive year, JD Power ranked Atmos Energy number one in customer satisfaction among mid-sized gas utilities in the Midwest. Atmos Energy is well-positioned to continue safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industry to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. I will now turn the call over to Christopher Forsythe.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal 2025 first-quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.23, which represents a 7.2% increase over the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating income increased 15% to $459 million in the first quarter. This performance is driven by several factors. Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $69 million. Residential commercial customer growth combined with higher industrial load increased operating income by an additional $10 million. Finally, APT's through-system revenues increased by $8 million driven by both an increase in throughput and spreads. These market conditions were largely driven by capacity constraints experienced primarily through the first half of the first quarter due to maintenance of unplanned additives on various pipelines. Since that time, spreads have returned to more normal historical norms for this time of the year.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $41 million increase in consolidated O and M. Driven by several factors. Net expense increased $15 million. As a reminder, we recognized a $14 million non-recurring reduction in added expense in the prior year quarter resulting from a regulatory change in how we recover our bad debt expenses slipping. Employee-related costs increased approximately $11 million primarily due to increased headcount to support company growth, and higher overtime and standby costs due to increased service work. We also experienced an $8 million increase in compliance and safety-related spending associated with increased leak service work within our distribution segment and time of the inline inspection work in our pipeline storage and other segment. Finally, we experienced a $5 million increase in APT's system safety and tariff expense, which is offset by a corresponding increase in revenue as a result of APT's new system safety and integrity mechanism. Therefore, this increase had no impact on operating income. We got off to a good start from a regulatory perspective. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have implemented $152 million in annualized operating income increases in our distribution segment. Of this amount, $117 million relates to the implementation of our two annual rate revenue mechanisms in Texas, and $28 million relates to the implementation of our two annual finance filings in the Pacific. Currently, we have seven filings in progress, seeking approximately $126 million in annualized operating income increases. Included in the filed format is approximately $90 million in taxes from four filings. The first is a $40 million system-wide general rate case in our West Texas distribution that we filed last fall. As a reminder, this is a required filing that affects all of our customers in West Texas, based on a settlement we reached in 2020. Additionally, we required refresher rates following five years of grid lines portions of our West Texas division. During the first fiscal quarter, we filed two new cases in our Mid Texas division, seeking $20 million as the five-year BRIC filing cycle had ended for these jurisdictions. And in January, we filed our annual filing mechanism with the Staview Dallas seeking a $30 million increase in annualized operating income. Finally, we have a general rate case in progress in Kentucky for approximately $34 million. These filings are proceeding as planned, and we anticipate completing all of them by late spring of 2025. We plan to make additional funds this fiscal year seeking approximately $300 million in annualized operating income increase. During the quarter, we completed over $1 billion of long-term debt equity financing, highlighted by the $650 million long-term debt financing we completed in October 2024. Additionally, we settled $380 million in equity for an agreement. Directly capitalization as of December 31 is 60%, and we did not have any short-term debt outstanding. We also had $5.2 billion in available liquidity. This includes approximately $1.5 billion of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal 2025 equity needs and almost all of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2026. Our first-quarter results have positioned us well to achieve fiscal 2025 in the range of $7.05 to $7.25. And we remain on track to achieve our capital spending plan of $3.7 billion. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open up the call for questions.
Operator: We'll take our first question from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Jefferies. Go ahead.
James Ward: Hi, guys. Good morning. You've got James Ward here on for Julien. How is everyone?
Kevin Akers: Good morning. Thank you. Good to hear from you.
James Ward: Perfect. We are looking for a little more coverage. Pardon me, I'm a bit under the weather, so hopefully, I'm still clear enough to hear. But, essentially, what we are looking for is a bit more color on the higher CapEx plan announced last quarter, looking at rate lags, earned ROE trajectory moving forward. A little more strategic, a bit more high level. Just looking to get some incremental color as we sort of build in some of those. You know, the potential. Of what could be into our models. The art of the possible, so to speak. As our leader here likes to say.
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Let's start with would be great. Yeah. Let's start with the first part of your question there around the capital plan for this year. As we said, at our last quarterly call, that reflects the growth across our system, our system modernization strategy, supporting our pipeline replacement program, continuing to be out in front of the growth that we just talked about on this call as well. We also heard of the interconnects on this call that APT is putting in place, as well as some of the storage enhancements that we have going out there. So it's a continuation of what we had the last several years, more of a roll-forward, if you will, as we continue to identify projects and growth areas across the system or areas that need additional system modernization. So continuation of the same strategy.
James Ward: Gotcha. Gotcha. Just wanted to clarify there. That's very helpful. See here. I think you kind of covered most of what we've actually set here. As questions and prepared remarks. So we really appreciate you guys giving that color. Anything else you could speak to just on the customer quote, sorry? I know you addressed it. Initially, but just anything. Need more color on sort of large-scale industrial and generation projects and so on. That would be our follow-on. We'll I'm back in the queue.
Kevin Akers: Okay. Thank you. Yeah. As as we said on on this call here, we continue to see good growth across all sectors. Residential, commercial, industrial. On the industrial side, eleven new coming on this quarter alone with about two to two and a half bcf anticipated load there. We continue to have prospects, but, again, we're not gonna get into the depth of the prospects until we have actual customers sign agreements with the company and we know for sure that they're gonna be a customer. Again, the economy, feedback from builders, developers, commercial developers as well continues to be strong across the entire service territory. So it's again, it's a continuation of what we've seen the last several years and continue to hear from those folks that things are looking positive across our services.
James Ward: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Sunderland: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time today.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
Richard Sunderland: Within that $1.5 billion under the equity forward for twenty-five and most of twenty-six. How much equity should we be modeling for twenty twenty-five specifically, and should we assume that ATM is ratable?
Christopher Forsythe: So if we traditionally talked about, again, equity, long-term debt being issued in a balanced fashion throughout fiscal year. So we have traditionally run in the $600 to $800 million range. I think that's a good range to plan on for fiscal 2025. It will you know, in terms of drawing it down, we talked about drawing down $380 million first quarter. The remainder of the fiscal year, it would just depend on our cash flow needs, And just where we see our balance sheet on any given point time during the year. So we'll try to do it, you know, around those needs. Could be ratable. It could be a little bit more quarter specific, but it just depends on how the year goes in terms of cash flow.
Richard Sunderland: Okay. Got it. So the $600 to $800 is helpful for twenty five, but then basically as we roll forward through the years in your plans, you'll be expecting that number to tick up annually. Is that the right way to think about it?
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah. That's that's correct. You know, as the as the capital continues to grow, kinda going back another question, you know, we got twenty four billion Yeah. Again, the five-year plan grew about $3.7 billion this year. That will continue to grow, you know, somewhat ravely over the next few years. And the the long-term financing will grow commensurately with that, again, in a balanced fashion using a long-term debt equity. With equity being through the ATM, this.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. Very clear. And then for APT spread benefit on the quarter, you're recognizing it's early in the year, but does this move you higher within the guidance range? Any other thoughts on sort of that benefit relative to guidance assumptions? Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Yeah. As as we had talked about, we we saw that spread widen early in the quarter and then come back to more normal what we're traditionally seeing this time of year. And we'll just have to keep an eye on it as we move forward. It's gonna depend on this. Again, what weather shows up the remainder of this heating season, what does the cooling load look like this summer, the power gen load, those sort of things. Again, I think we're just gonna have to watch the market and see what it does as we head into the rest of the fiscal year right now and not try and predict or get too far out in front of that.
Richard Sunderland: Fair enough. Thank you for the time today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
David Arcaro: Oh, hey. Thanks. Good morning.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
David Arcaro: Let me see. You had a question on the power plant side of things. Maybe we've been hearing more about microgrids and new gas-powered power plants looking for long-term contracts for gas supply. I guess I was wondering, are any of those eleven new industrial customers power plants? And then maybe more broadly, are you seeing more opportunities on the customer side of things from power generation?
Kevin Akers: Let's let's take the middle part of your questionnaire first. No. These eleven are not new power facilities. There are a variety of industries from distilling to manufacturing. Battery plants, to automotive, Again, I think that's the strength of our service territories. We've got exceptional diversification of load from residential commercial, which we see a lot of here in Texas, to industrial through Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Mississippi. A good balance across the system of large load and diversified load as well as some of those industrial loads are more medical in nature as well. So supporting the medical industry. As we we've seen with those larger industrial loads, we continue to have inquiries across all eight states. But, again, don't wanna get into specifics or speculate at this point until we actually have customers that have signed a contract and are ready to make announcements at this point. Other than that, continue to work with economic development chambers of commerce, customers that wanna talk about, think about, or seek opportunities for natural gas supply in various locations. We'll continue to answer their questions and wait until we get to an actual signature on the contract.
David Arcaro: Okay. Understood. Yeah. Thanks for that color. That makes sense. And then maybe on the rate case in Texas and West Texas. Just wondering if there's any anticipated areas of focus in terms of challenges or any issues that you think with getting the grip re-upped now that you're getting into the next iteration of those longer-term programs there.
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah. David, I would characterize these rate cases again coming to the end of the five-year group cycle or being stipulated by a prior settlement just really focused on the I'm gonna call the blocking and tackling the regulatory mechanism to refresh the RWA, the cap structure, we're asking for, you know, various riders seem to move to SSI or what other utilities in the state have previously received. So yeah, these are not maybe potentially new to Atmos, but certainly not new in terms of concepts. That have been discussed that within the regulatory framework in Texas. So again, our team is doing a great job in working through the regulatory process as I mentioned, we're hopeful to have all of these wrapped up by the end of the spring.
David Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Good to hear. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Beshi with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Beshi: Hi, good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. I congrats on another successful quarter. I just really have one follow-up regarding balance sheet to support both rating outlook since it's been a year almost a year that we had the last credit update. And with higher equity issuance, just in the first quarter this year, you reported and the colors you just provided on the equity plan on an annualized basis. How should we think about AFFO debt metric going forward? Thanks.
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. Yes. Hi. This is Chris. So, you know, as you mentioned, Moody's has put us on the negative outlook back in April of last year. They typically take about twelve months to refresh their outlook and their whole management process. We've been in communication with them on a regular basis since April, providing them updates as sort of what we provided to the investment community around the new five-year plan. Take a look at the FFO to debt, and we'll see where they come out probably by the end of March, early part of April. Based upon the timing. But again, you know, as we think about our financing strategy, we realize the equity capitalization for this day it's benefited us many, many times over the last five years through pandemics, you know, but economic volatility, winter storm, Uri, and the like. We feel like that's a very comfortable position to be in. And so we're see where Moody's comes out on that, but we have factored in various alternatives within our planning cycle depending on how the rating checks out. But ultimately, you know, if it's a one or one notch downgrade perhaps, it probably should not have much of an impact on financing cost at all.
Beshi: Perfect. Thanks for the colors. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Good morning.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
Ryan Levine: I guess given all the headlines at the federal level around tariffs, wanted to hear your comments around the impact of Chinese and potentially Mexican tariffs around O and M and CapEx. I assume it's small, but any color you could share?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Ryan, we continue to watch that. I'll start with saying we're very pleased to see the support both with some of the executive orders and through press conferences for the oil and natural gas industry. What we do what the men and women of the oil and natural gas industry do every day to fuel this energy demand and provide for national security. Very proud of of what our folks continue to do. It's good to see and hear that recognition. We continue to watch as executive orders come out. We continue to communicate with our key stakeholders at the federal level as well. On the tariff piece of it, to that part of your question, just saw recently where those were put on pause. So we're gonna continue to work with our vendors and suppliers, manufacturers, to see which of any components that we currently have sourced are either fully made overseas or all made here or parts brought here to and assembled here in the United States. So right now, I would say they'd probably be on the lower end if at all, but we're continuing to work vendors and suppliers. To put a handle on that and anticipate what that may look like as we go forward.
Ryan Levine: If there were to be an upward pressure on cost, you can you remind us around the regulatory mechanisms across your service territory to allow for recovery on the capital side?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Again, we have annual mechanisms and just about every jurisdiction. One place will have traditional cases, like the ones Chris mentioned today. Like Kentucky, like Virginia. Or Kansas, those would be the ones where we'd go in to recover any of those costs should they show up. But at this point, again, continue to work and identify with our suppliers and vendors if there is anything that would would show itself.
Ryan Levine: Thanks. And then on the Sibor van, in terms of federal announcements around Stargate and Seven. Potential developments in the Abilene, the extent there's consumption in that region. Would that have any impact on your business?
Kevin Akers: Well, again, if if a customer wants to sign a contract and come on to our system, it'd more than likely be on the APT system. There. And as you know, we have APT system. that seventy-five, twenty-five percent sharing mechanism with the customers. And that would be on available capacity on an interruptible basis. customer being on So we would share any upside that would come through from that with those customers at a seventy-five percent rate.
Ryan Levine: Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude our question and answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Daniel Meziere for any closing remarks.
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review our financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 37, and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. As Monday is Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have served in our armed forces. Approximately 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are a part of the more than 18 million Americans, who bravely served our country. Thank you for your service, and thank you to those currently serving this great nation. Fiscal '24 marked Atmos Energy's 40th anniversary as an independent company. All 5,200 of us here at Atmos Energy proudly serve our customers and our communities as we continue to be guided by the simple values of our founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan of honesty, integrity and good moral character. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $6.83, which represents the 22nd consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Fiscal '24 also represents the 40th consecutive year of dividend growth. Our fiscal year results reflect the focus and dedication of the entire Atmos Energy team and their continued successful execution of our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '24 capital investment of over $2.9 billion, supported the modernization of our systems through the replacement of over 850 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 55,000 service lines. Additionally, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system by placing into service our line PC on the southern end of APT system, as well as Phase 1 of the Line WA Loop to the west of Fort Worth and Phase 3 of 4 for Line S2 to the east of the DFW Metroplex. And we've completed the well integrity inspections on our Bethel Salt dome cavern #2. We expect base gas and working gas injection to be completed next month, providing the availability of all three salt dome caverns for this winter season. Our capital investment also supported natural gas service to fuel the strong economic development we continue to see across our service territories. In fiscal '24, we added over 59,000 new residential and commercial customers with over 46,000 of those new customers located in Texas. The housing market in the DFW Metroplex remains strong. For the 12 months ended September 30th, new home closing set a record high with a nearly 1% increase over the prior 12 month period, driven by the strength of the Texas economy. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally-adjusted number of employed reached a new record high at over 14.3 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 327,000 jobs from September 2023 through September 2024. In addition to this robust residential customer growth, we saw solid commercial and industrial growth. In fiscal '24, we added nearly 3,500 new commercial customers, a 19% increase over the prior fiscal year. And we added 39 industrial customers, which when fully operational are anticipated to consume approximately 8.4 Bcf of gas annually. This usage is equivalent to adding over 160,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. Over the last five years, we added nearly 300,000 residential and commercial customers. Over the last five years, we have added 225 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 63 Bcf, when fully operational. Again, on a volumetric-basis, this is equivalent to adding nearly 1.2 million residential customers. This growing natural gas demand from all customer classes continues to demonstrate the vital role natural gas has in economic development across our service territories. Our customer support associates and service technicians continue to be at their best and inspire trust with our customers and in our community, through their exceptional customer service. They once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. And during the fiscal year, our customer advocacy team assisted over 57,000 customers in receiving almost $23 million in energy assistance funding. I am very proud of our Atmos Energy team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '24. Their exceptional work has us well positioned for fiscal '25 and beyond. As you know, we operate in a diversified and growing service territory that is supportive of natural gas and our investment in natural gas infrastructure to supply the growing economy and meet the growing energy demand. As a reminder, 96% of our rate base is located in six of our eight states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice. To meet the expectations of our communities, our customers, policymakers and regulators, our five year plan contemplates $24 billion of capital investment. That investment will support the continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as well as support the growing natural gas demand across our jurisdictions, with over 80% of that investment focused on safety and reliability. At APT, we will remain focused on safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification, while fortifying our system to support the growth of the LDC located behind our pipeline. This includes the completion of the final phase of our Line S-2 project to the east of the DFW Metroplex, continuation of the Line WA Loop project to the west of the DFW Metroplex, and adding capacity to move additional gas from our Bethel, Salt down facility towards Central Texas. The strength of our balance sheet, available liquidity and regulatory mechanisms will continue to support the vital role we play in every community of safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. I will now turn the call over to Chris for some additional color around our fiscal '24 financial results, our fiscal '25 guidance and our updated five year plan through fiscal '29. And then we will open the call for questions. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '24 earnings per share of $6.83 increased 12% over fiscal '23. As a reminder, these results include $0.17 from the one-time benefits we have discussed previously, an unplanned property tax reduction in Texas and lower than planned bad debt expense in Mississippi resulting from a regulatory change in how we recover uncollectible accounts. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share increased 9.2% in fiscal '24. Our performance continues to reflect in the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies. In fiscal '24, we implemented $376 million in annualized operating income increases. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '23 increased operating income by over $300 million. Strong customer growth combined with rising industrial load in our Distribution segment increased operating income an additional $25 million, and rising peak day demand requirements from APT's LDC customers resulting in a $15 million increase in operating income. Finally, we saw a $39 million increase from APT's boosters in activities. About half of this increase was recognized during our fourth fiscal quarter. During this time, WAHA pricing is negative for 63% of the trading days. These market conditions were primarily driven by unplanned maintenance on certain pipelines and delays in new takeaway capacity coming online, both of which caused spreads to widen more than we had anticipated. These fourth quarter market conditions were the primary reason, why our fiscal '24 results exceeded the updated guidance range we provided in August. Consolidated O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $65 million. This increase is largely driven by higher employee related costs due to additional headcount to support growth and higher costs associated with increased line locating activities, system monitoring, training and administrative costs. Consolidated capital spending increased 5% or $131 million to $2.9 billion with 83% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This spending increased rate base by approximately 13% to an estimated $19 billion as of September 30th. Capital spending in our Distribution segment increased $322 million primarily as a result of increased system modernization and customer growth spending. Capital spending in our Pipeline & Storage segment decreased about $191 million primarily due to the timing of cash payments for pipeline system and safety and reliability work in Texas, that had been completed during the fiscal year. Finally, we completed $1.2 billion of long-term financing. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61% and approximately $4.8 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well-positioned to support our future operations. Looking forward, we have initiated our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance range of $7.05 to $7.25. Assuming the midpoint of this guidance range, this implies 7.4% growth in fiscal '24 earnings per share, excluding the previously mentioned one-time item. And we have initiated fiscal '25 capital spending guidance for approximately $3.7 billion Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 164th quarterly cash dividend with an indicated fiscal '25 annual dividend of $3.48, 8.1% increase over fiscal 2024. Finally, we rolled forward our five year plan in fiscal '29. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, take time of recovery of our costs through our various regulatory mechanisms and maintain a strong balance sheet, by financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt. We anticipate the execution of this five year plan will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth and annual dividends per share growth. We anticipate earnings per share in fiscal '29 to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.55. As Kevin mentioned, we've included approximately $24 billion in our current five year plan. This level of spending is expected to support rate base growth of about 13% to 15% per year. By the end of fiscal '29, we anticipate rate base to increase from approximately $19 billion today to approximately $37 billion in fiscal '29. From a revenue perspective, we continue to execute our normal regulatory strategy of implementing approximately 20 rate filings per year. We have assumed no changes to our ROEs or regulatory mechanisms, nor have we assumed the implementation of new cost recovery mechanisms in this cycle plan. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have implemented $149 million of annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, $116 million is related to the implementation of our two annual rate review mechanisms in Texas and $27 million related to the implementation of our two annual rate filings in Mississippi. Currently, we have three filings pending seeking about $77 million. Included in this filed for amount is approximately $40 million related to a system-wide general rate case in our West Texas distribution. This is a required filing affecting all customers in our West Texas division based on a settlement we reached in 2020. Additionally, we are required to refresh our rates upon five years of GRIP filings for portions of our West Texas division. We anticipate filing two similar cases in our Mid Texas Division during our first quarter, where just our cities will recover our costs through GRIP. Additionally, we have filed a general rate case in Kentucky seeking approximately $34 million. We anticipate completing all of these general rate cases in late spring of 2025. From a margin perspective, we've also assumed normal weather, market conditions and modest customer growth in both of our segments in this five year plan. Additionally, we have assumed a 6% decrease in the oil and gas costs included in the customer bill, primarily due to lower commodity costs, partially offset by higher storage and transportation costs. Finally, we have assumed the contribution from APT's three system business to normalize for fiscal '24 levels. Additional takeaway capacity is now in place, which should moderate spreads, and we will have the full year effect of the higher revenue benchmark in APT's wider breadth mechanism. On the cost side, we have assumed 4% annual O&M inflation, excluding bad debt expense. This inflation assumption is driven by increased spending for compliance-based activities to address system safety, system monitoring and employee costs. As we've discussed before, we are not a just in time compliance company, meaning that, we will look to accelerate compliance related work within the five year plan as system conditions dictate or if other opportunities arise. For fiscal '25, we anticipate O&M, excluding bad debt expense, to range from $840 million to $860 million, Approximately $20 million of the year over year increase relates to the amortization of APT's system safety and integrity mechanism. As a reminder, this new mechanism was approved in APT's last general rate case and is a flow through mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and safety regulated regulations, meaning, we recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission, resulting in no impact to operating income. APT made its first SSI filing earlier this calendar year, seeking recovery of approximately $19 million in eligible SSI costs. This filing was approved in October, and revenues and O&M were adjusted effective November 1st to recover these costs over a 12 month period. Turning now to our financing plan. This five year plan includes approximately $15 billion of incremental long-term financing to support our operations and cash needs, including the expected impact of the corporate minimum income tax beginning in fiscal '27. We will continue to use a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and minimize the cost of financing for our customers and overall financing risk. As a reminder, this incremental financing is included in our earnings per share guidance for fiscal '25 through fiscal '29. Following the completion of our $650 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity was 18.1 years with our next material refinancing not scheduled until June of 2027. From an equity perspective, we anticipate meeting all of our needs through our ATM program. As of September 30th, we have priced $1.4 billion which fully satisfies our fiscal '25 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '26 equity needs. This recent financing activity has substantially reduced our existing shelf registration statement and exhausted our ATM program. Once we receive the necessary regulatory approval, we intend to file for a new three year $8 billion shelf agreement and a new $1.7 billion ATM program to support our anticipated financing needs. In closing, like Kevin, I am very excited for the long-term outlook for Atmos Energy. Our operational and financial performance in fiscal '24 has laid the foundation for sustained success into fiscal '25 and beyond. The successful execution of this plan will continue to support 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share growth and commensurate dividends per share growth, while maintaining a strong financial profile, all of which supports our ability to meet our customers' needs and expectations in our growing service territories. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Fei She with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Fei She: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks very much for taking my questions, and congrats on another strong year of execution. First, I just wanted to quickly touch on financing, for some further clarity. If I recall previously, you target $600 million to $800 million a year through ATM to support your capital program. So now you have the $8 billion shelf registration you plan to file at $1.7 billion ATM you're renewing. First, I guess, how should we think about the run rate going forward? And also, could you, just discuss a little bit of about how should we think about financing this higher capital plan outside of ATM program? Thanks.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you. So again, we have an incremental $15 billion financing assumption in this five year plan. Again, we want to maintain the current strength of our balance sheet. If you want to assume 50% is equity, 50% is long-term debt and then you take that 50% assumption. And generally, relatively over the next five years that's about what the equity need will be, feel a little bit lower in fiscal '25, it will ramp up a little bit in '26 and beyond. But I think that's how you can think about it from a modeling perspective. In terms of just broader financing, this increased CapEx program, we do believe that, we were able -- we will be able to satisfy the equity needs through the ATM program, as well as the continued issuance of long-term debt in order to preserve and maintain the strength of balance sheet.
Fei She: That's great, really helpful. And if I can quickly touch on just the financing side of the equation regarding interest cost, as we roll forward to '25, obviously, you covered $300 million for fiscal -- for that year. And I guess going forward and deeper into the plan, how should we think about doing more interest rate swaps, and kind of maintaining the current debt-to-capitalization ratio in the five year plan?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I'll take the second question first on the debt-to-capitalization. We're very comfortable with where that debt-to-capitalization is at this point and we tend to maintain that going forward. And in terms of the interest rate hedging, it has proven to be very successful for us in the last several years, save our customers a lot of money. Dan and his team will continue to look for opportunities to lock in hedges at a point in time where we think it's appropriate to lock in that cost to drive cost stability going forward in the five year plan and also for the benefit of customers. So it's something we'll consider doing, just again as we -- as market conditions continue to evolve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Richard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning and thank you for the time today. So starting on the CapEx side, given, it's a pretty staggering race here to your five year plan, could you parse some of the factors underpinning the higher pace of system investment? I know you gave some color at a high level on sort of 80% for safety and reliability, what have you, but I'm curious you can give a little bit more specificity around growth, change in replacement rates, anything else driving that higher level?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I appreciate your question. I'll point you back to what we talked about earlier, particularly around the 60, almost 60,000 new customers this past fiscal year. That's been pretty close over the last several fiscal years. Again, we're seeing robust growth on the residential, commercial and industrial side that continues to happen year in year out. We continue to look at the housing starts, the market stability here in Texas, as we talked about with the Texas Workforce Commission highlighting the employment growth that continues to occur year in year out here. That's all driving the demand on our system. Again, we need to be out in front of that growth, have it in place for the anticipated winter needs and fueling those commercial industrial demand as well. Those are part of what's driving that growth fortification. But the other part of it, again, is driven by what our risk models or risk factor tells us on a go forward with our pipe replacement program. So just as we've done in the previous years, we're going to look to those models to guide us to where and when to replace pipe. That's what's rolled out through the five year plan there along with meeting the expectations of demand and growth, whether it's on distribution as well as on APT system as well. You heard the two or three projects we talked about there of completing Line S-2, WA Loop, Bethel to grow Spec that we've talked about before as well as some of the work we're doing on storage, all in this capital investment plan that we've laid out.
Richard Sunderland: Great. Very clear. Thank you. And then, turning again to some of the numbers in this update, comparing the 13% to 15% rate base growth versus your 6% to 8% EPS growth guidance. The numbers seem to imply you, should be at or above the top end of the earnings range. I realize there is equity dilution, but I'm curious what is keeping the CAGR at 6% to 8%. Is there any reason you should not be at the top end or higher?
Christopher Forsythe: Again, we look at our plan with a very conservative eye. There are still a lot of things as you know just coming out of an election, what's going on around the world, that we'll continue to take in our decision and thinking as we move forward there. But again, we believe, that's our comfortable range, as we've executed upon over the last several years. And given where we set today, we think that's very comfortable on a go forward basis for us.
Kevin Akers: Yes. I'll also add to that. We've also increased the O&M CAGR, if you will, from 3.5% to 4%. That's also a kind of a modifying effect on the earnings per share growth vis-a-vis the rate base growth.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Jeffrey with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Christopher Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one from me on the '25 guide, kind of, off of 2024, you'd mentioned in your comments about the strong benefits from the WAHA spread. Just kind of how you're thinking about that year-over-year, and kind of versus this year's level? Thanks.
Kevin Akers: Yes. Again, as Chris said in his comments, we've got a new Rider Rep benchmark that's out there approximately $107 million going into this year. Spreads did mitigate somewhat coming out of the summer period. We'll continue to look and see how weather affects that. But on a go forward, we look for things to normalize to a certain extent from what we saw earlier this summer period. That's how we will approach it on a go forward is more on a normalized basis. Again, most of that or all of that demand on APT is for the LDC customers behind the pipes that are out there. So anything we'll do, we'll have to be on off-peak within the summer period when maintenance isn't occurring out there. So we'll look to that again back on a normalized basis.
Christopher Jeffrey: Got it. Thanks. And then Chris, you had mentioned, about taking the O&M from 3.5% to 4%. Just curious, maybe what you're seeing there? Is that related at all to the SSI rider at APT? And kind of, is there any maybe cadence if that's front-loaded, back-loaded or kind of consistent? Thanks.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, certainly between '24 and '25, we'll have a step up because of the SSI rider. We had roughly $6 million or $7 million flow through in fiscal '24. We're looking for closer to $20 million to $25 million in 2025. Again, it's offset in the margin line item. But, we're also just planning for just increased compliance related spending, system surveys, system monitoring, more real time monitoring in the system. You've heard us talk about our AMLD units, we have 16 now that are on the system that we're using in all eight of our states to monitor our system a lot more closely. And then, just we have employee cost as our population or our customer growth continues, we'll have the key to add service technicians and the like to make sure, we're properly serving those growing needs.
Kevin Akers: Yes. Additionally, the thing I'll add there is our line locates with this growing base, particularly here in the Texas region. We continue to grow the number of line locates that we continue to do as well as the rest of the infrastructure is driving that locates. And what I mean by that, as you have water, sewer infrastructure being put in with growing population and all of those leads for us to drive, locate and procted our assets as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Paul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning, team. I had a couple of questions. One big, one small. The first, I'll start with the bigger one. There's a new very large potential natural gas customer that Entergy has talked about, like 2.3 gigawatts of combined cycle in Northern Louisiana. It looks like you're the local gas utility there. Just any way you could frame potential, whether it's kind of the local or broader capital needs related to that? And just how you're thinking about some of these lumpier economic development activities you're tracking across your footprint would be helpful.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I don't have any specifics that we could share at this point, on the Louisiana customer. But, in general, as we talked about large industrial loads over a period of time, we work with both our state economic development group, chambers of commerce, and local communities on sourcing and citing of these particular customers, what is best for them, what may benefit their energy demand for natural gas, how it's located to either our distribution or transmission assets. And then, we'll work with the customer on timing over a period of years, when they anticipate ramping up their usage that way. But, we continue to see steady inquiries as you heard quarter-after-quarter as described from various aspects of the industrial sector, whether it's metals, whether it's healthcare, whether it's distilling, various factors continue to drive the growth on the industrial side.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. That potential customer in Northern Louisiana, is that something that could be upside to the plan or we should kind of think about that within the scope of your capital guidance you put out?
Christopher Forsythe: Again, we have a lot of customers across our territory looking and siding on a daily basis. We generally don't talk about those, until we have certainty around contractual obligations, ready to serve needs, those sort of things. Right now at this point, we're not at a point where we can discuss any particulars that aren't at that state of process.
Paul Zimbardo: Okay. Understood. And then, the smaller one. Just in terms of 2025 guidance and interest, it looks like it ticks down a little bit versus the balances up, the weighted cost of debt is up. Just, is that a function of lower short-term rates on commercial paper? Just any other dynamics there we should be cognizant of? Thank you.
Christopher Forsythe: That's really the influence of, ATBC or capitalized interest. As our spending goes up, we do have a higher portion of our capitalized interest. Again with an all in weighted average cost of 4.1 ticked up very slightly, I mean, less than 5 or 10 basis points year-over-year. It's relatively flat. And then you've got the increased capitalized interest component, which is driving the net interest expense down a bit.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. What's your assumption for bad debt expense and how does that impact the outlook? It looked like that was excluded from the 4% O&M guide. Is there any lumpiness to that with some of the changes to how that's being accounted for?
Kevin Akers: No. Really no changes anticipated. It was a little bit skewed this year obviously with the change in how we record our collect or uncollectible accounts in Mississippi. We're kind of beginning to normalize into more of a pre-pandemic state in terms of that debt expense. It's always going to rise a bit as a function of revenue going up a bit. But, as we continue to work our comprehensive collection strategy of not only just working with customers around energy assistance, offering them installment plans, levelized billing and alike. We anticipate that to be fairly flat year-over-year in the five year plan.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then what are you assuming for population growth or customer count growth in the Texas market in particular? And then, how sensitive is your outlook to that forecast?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I would say, we've assumed a growth rate that is in line with what we've experienced here over the last couple of years. You heard Kevin talk early in the call about just continued growth from a residential perspective, certainly and then the knock on commercial impact, that we've just assumed basically recent trends that will continue going forward in this five year plan.
Ryan Levine: And then last question. In terms of the 4% O&M guidance, how lumpy is that throughout the forecast time period? Are there periods that are higher than that and others that are lower than that, or any color you can share?
Kevin Akers: No. I think year over year it's going to be, I would say, fairly gradual 4% every year. You might have a little bit of lumpiness within quarters, as we move work around to address the system needs, operational constraints so on and so forth. But year-over-year, we expect that to be fairly level at 4% per year.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Meziere, I turn the call back over to you.
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December 31st. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-08-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Dan, you may begin.
Daniel Meziere: All right. Thank you, Krista. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 32, and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year to date diluted earnings per share of $6 compared to $5.33 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third quarter and fiscal year to date results continued to be driven by two things: regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending and customer growth. Additionally, strong through system revenues of APT, particularly during the third fiscal quarter, contribute to our performance. Regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by $238 million and residential customer growth and rising industrial load and our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $18 million. Our pipeline and storage segment increased $19 million period over period. $11 million of this amount [Technical Difficulty] mechanism was realized during our third fiscal quarter. Several of pipelines coming out of the Permian experienced planned and unplanned maintenance. This reduction takeaway capacity of a robust associated natural gas production, while the spreads between the water heater on the western end of APT system and deliver points to the eastern and southern ends of system. We expect credit spreads remain elevated through the end of our fiscal year. Excluding the $14 million of one-time bad debt adjustment we report in Mississippi in the first quarter, consolidated O&M increase in net $16 million or about 3%. This increase is primarily due to higher employee-related costs, insurance premiums, IT software maintenance costs, partially offset by $15 million decrease in O&M and our pipeline and storage segment, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work. As expected, O&M in the third fiscal quarter trended higher than the prior-year quarter, and we anticipate O&M spending in the fourth fiscal quarter of trend higher as well, has continued to focus our spending on compliance, maintenance and system monitoring. We still expect fiscal '24 O&M to be in the range of $800 million to $820 million. Consolidated capital spending increased to $2.1 billion to 8% plus dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. Setting our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety and reliability spending -- higher spending to support customer growth. Spending in our pipeline and storage segment is lower than the prior year due to timing. We remain on track to spend approximately $3.1 billion this fiscal year. Since the end of our second fiscal quarter, we implemented about $213 billion in annualized regulatory outcomes, including all of this year's Texas GRIP filings and annual filings with the City of Dallas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Year to date, we have completed $380 million annualized for inventory outcomes. Currently, we have an additional $182 million annualized outcomes in progress. Additionally, we made our first filing under APT's new system safety and integrity mechanism, seeking a $19 million increase in revenues. This new mechanism was approved APT's last general rate case as a floating mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and state safety related regulations, meaning we will recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission resulting in no impact to operating income. Our financial position continues to remains strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61%, and approximate $4.3 billion liquidity. This amount includes $551 million net proceeds available on our existing forward sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '24 equity needs and most of our anticipated fiscal '25 needs. In June, we completed a $325 million senior unsecured debt offering, tapping our existing 10 year 5.9% senior notes. As a result, for overall weighted average cost of debt as of June 30 stands at 4.1%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with the weighted average maturity of approximately 17 years. As we head into the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we now believe our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance will be at the higher end of our reaffirmed earnings per share guidance range of $6.70 and $6.80. Our anticipated financing plan for fiscal 2024 is complete. All regulatory outcomes that can impact fiscal '24 has been implemented. As I mentioned ago, we anticipate spreads for APTs through system business will remain elevated, which will modestly contribute to our Q4 results. And we have a reasonably clear line of sight and consistent compliance, maintenance, and monitoring we will be performing in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our guidance range includes two items totaling $0.17 that we will exclude when we initiate our '25 guidance in November. The first item is the Texas property tax benefit that we have been discussing all fiscal year, which should favorably impact fiscal '24 results by $0.10. Additionally, the one-time Mississippi Fed debt adjustment for represented $0.07. We continue to anticipate 6% to 8% earnings per share growth and adjusted EPS amount through fiscal '28. Thank you for your time today, and I will turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We continue to benefit from solid economic growth in our service territory. For the 12 months ended June 30, we added 57,000 new customers, with nearly 45,000 of those new customers located in Texas. So Texas Workforce Commission reported in July that the seasonally adjusted number of employed reached 14.2 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months ending June; adding over 267,000 jobs, representing a 1.9% annual growth rate. Industrial demand for natural gas and service territories also remained strong. During the third quarter, we added 10 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 2 Bcf, once they are fully operational. Fiscal year to date, we have added 32 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, the 6 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 110,000 residential customers. And during the first nine months of the fiscal year, our customer support agents and customer advocacy team continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers, helping over 47,000 customers received nearly $19 million in funding assistance. Our consistent performance reflects the vital role we play in every community: safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays.
Nicholas Campanella: I just wanted to first quickly touch on financing. Could you just further discuss the equity needs for '25? And definitely, given '25 largely done with all our instruments and the recent renewal of ATM, just how does that better facilitate the equity needs in 2025? Thanks.
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah. Well, this is Chris. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We typically issue between $600 million and $800 million a year in equity through the ATM program that we have seen. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we had $551 million of price at the end of June, which that amount will basically mostly satisfy our fiscal 2025 needs. So I think that hopefully that will give you enough color to update your models.
Nicholas Campanella: That's great. Thanks for the colors. Very helpful. Maybe just quickly turning to O&M execution for '25, you raised the midpoint guidance by $20 million last quarter. And I guess things are on track for this year. Could you talk about going forward, what are some of the key items you're focusing on O&M execution? And how are you benchmarking with a 3.5% annual increase guidance? Thanks.
Kevin Akers: Yeah, this is Kevin. Good morning. Glad to have you join us today. Again, we're working through the remainder of fiscal '24 right now and anticipate it will be the same items as we move into '25. And we'll have additional detail and color as we get to our November call on 25. But again, the drivers around O&M continue to be hydrostatic testing, line locating, integrity regulations, markable placement on difficult, hard to locate lines. So all sort of things. And then looking for opportunities as we move forward to enhance those or pull things forward when we had the ability to do that. So again, the same items that we're focused on this year, we anticipate seeing again in '25.
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah -- and I'll add to that, too, is that no, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, we're still anticipating 6% to 80% EPS growth off of the adjusted EPS and now for fiscal '24. So that's the overall theme to take away from. We will have some puts and takes in the O&M. As Kevin mentioned, we're still guiding to that 6% to 8% growth target.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.
Richard Sunderland: Looking at '24 results, you've called out the $0.17 of one-offs. I'm curious how we should think about the rest of the business into '25 -- everything else continuing to '25 other than APT spread benefit, meaning take to succeed in your top and less $0.17 and maybe back out another roughly $0.10 for the spread pickup?
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah. I think you're on target there, Richard, backing out the $0.17 off of whatever you want to assume for the outcome for fiscal '24 APT, we will have some spread activity next year, but we just can't predict it. So I wouldn't necessarily discount too far off of what you have -- the two one-time items when you're starting your 7% or 8% or 9%, whatever you want to do on the growth target for fiscal 2025, as we will have some activity. It is just this time this year, and particularly in the third quarter, we saw some elevated spreads. And as you commented, it is expected to revert back to the mean, which means we'll still have some activity there.
Richard Sunderland: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And I guess one quick follow-up on that spread opportunity. I know you referenced in the script kind of a continuation into 4Q. Is that already contemplated in the higher end guidance language or is that potential upside depending on how that materializes?
Christopher Forsythe: No, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've updated here this morning.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.
Ryan Levine: To follow-up on the APT spread dynamics. What are you assuming for the Matterhorn in-service date with the current '24 guidance? Are you assuming that the spread means right for the remaining portion of your fiscal year?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. As Chris said, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance this year on the upstream segments of APT there that would impact the spreads right now. They've mitigated from the highs we've seen over the last quarter somewhat. And look, going forward, definitely Matterhorn will be coming on, I think, if you read some of the documentation from the upstream folks sometime in September, October, early fall, that will be coming on. We just have to watch and see what that does for the dynamics out there. And then as we normally get into the in winter period, demand will drive it further from there on the spread impact. But again, I'd like to remind here why APT adjusts and that's to serve the customers behind it, the LDCs behind it, and then when we have opportunity, we will move that gas across our system. So right now, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance upstream that would impact the spreads any further than what we're currently seeing today at this point.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then a follow-up on that. Given the strong performance this fiscal year on APT, does that have any implications for resetting the bar which you get the sharing mechanism in future time periods?
Kevin Akers: No, that's said in the rate case itself on a go forward, so the next time that a potential be looked at would be in the next five years -- in the next required filing?
Christopher Forsythe: Yeah. So as a reminder, that bar was set at $106.9 million. And so that's the benchmark we got to achieve to begin sharing over and above that amount. And of course, it works the other way too if we fall short, but $106.9 million is the target we're looking at.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And last question for me. To the extent that there is new gas generation or infrastructure built in your service territory, do you see any opportunities on the LDC side to maybe build some infrastructure to support the movement of gas associated some of the gas generation that may be coming?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. As we talked about on previous calls, there's always that opportunity out there. But let's remember the power generators that we currently have behind APT system, we're one of several suppliers to them, so they can move or flex between suppliers at their will out there. So we wouldn't be a sole supplier. So we'll just continue to keep an eye on that over the next few years and see how that develops. But again, we would be one of several of suppliers or inputs into those facilities.
Operator: And that concludes our question and answer session. And I will now turn the conference back over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel Meziere: Thanks. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us today. And a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-05-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Dan, please go ahead. 
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.
 As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 30 and more fully described in our SEC filings.
 With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin? 
John Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal '24 net income of $743 million or $4.93 per diluted share. And we updated our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states.
 For the quarter, we continue to experience robust customer growth, driven by continuing favorable employment trends in Texas, along with a strong new housing market in the North Texas area. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, we added over 56,000 new customers, with more than 43,000 of those new customers located in Texas.
 New home starts in North Texas were up 44.7% during the first calendar quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a result, the annual new home start rate is now at the highest pace since mid-2022.
 The Texas Workforce Commission reported in April that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.1 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, ending March, adding nearly 271,000 jobs, representing a 2% annual growth rate.
 Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 11 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 1 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 22 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 4 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, this is equal to adding approximately 68,000 residential customers to our system.
 Commercial customer growth remained solid as well, with over 900 customers connecting to the system during the second quarter and over 2,000 customers connecting to the system fiscal year-to-date. This growth continues to highlight the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.
 In APT, we continue our work on several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system, as well as support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT's system.
 Work continues on the fourth and final phase of our Line S-2 project. This phase will replace the existing 14-inch and 20-inch pipelines with 40 miles of 36-inch pipeline. As a reminder, this project brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. This phase of the project is anticipated to be in service by the end of this calendar year.
 To the south of the DFW Metroplex, we have a project underway that will provide additional pipeline capacity to transport gas from our Bethel storage facility into the growing DFW Metroplex in the growth corridor along Interstate 35 in Waco, Temple and the Austin area. This project is scheduled to be placed into service late in calendar year 2025.
 During the second quarter, our customer support associates and service technicians once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers, reflecting the exceptional customer service they provide each and every day. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Through their efforts, the team helped nearly 34,000 customers receive over $12 million in funding assistance.
 Recently, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked Atmos Energy first in customer satisfaction. This is the second consecutive year we have reached this ranking. For the second year in a row as well, recognition on Newsweek's list of Most Trustworthy Companies in America. And we also appeared in the first Newsweek Excellence 1000 index, which identifies models of corporate responsibility across more than 25 industries.
 Finally, for the fourth consecutive year, we were named on the Forbes list of America's Best Midsize Employers. And this year, we are ranked first among all companies in the utility industry. This recognition demonstrates how our dedicated employees continue to be guided by the simple values of honesty, integrity and good moral character, the core values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan. These values, combined with our employees' laser-focus on our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, continue to benefit our customers and the communities we serve.
 I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update. 
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, earnings per share for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was $4.93, which represents a 12% increase over the $4.40 per share reported in the prior year period. Operating income increased to $950 million or 28% for the first 6 months of the fiscal year. I'll highlight a few key drivers for our financial performance.
 Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $192 million. Residential commercial customer growth in our Distribution segment, combined with higher industrial load, increased operating income by an [ additional ] $12 million. Revenues in our Pipeline & Storage segment increased $8 million period-over-period, due to wider spreads between the Waha header on the western end of APT system and delivery points in the eastern and southern ends of its system.
 Consolidated O&M expense decreased $13 million, primarily driven by the onetime bad debt adjustment we recorded in Mississippi in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, O&M was essentially flat period-over-period.
 Finally, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $15 million from the legislative change in Texas to reduce property tax expenses that we discussed last quarter. This amount approximates $0.07.
 From a regulatory perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have implemented approximately $170 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and we currently have over $350 million in progress. Of this amount, we anticipate implementing $170 million to $180 million in fiscal '24, with the remainder in the first quarter of fiscal '25.
 Our balance sheet and financial position remains strong. Our equity capitalization as of March 31 was 61%, and we did not have any short-term net outstanding.
 During the second quarter, we expanded our available liquidity through the renewal of our four credit facilities. We now have $3.1 billion available from these facilities, a $600 million increase over what was provided by our former credit facilities.
 At quarter end, we had $4.2 billion of available liquidity to support our operations. Included in this amount is $890 million of net proceeds available from our ATM activities, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal '24 equities and a significant portion of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal '25. And as we mentioned before, the ATM will continue to be our preferred method to issue [ equity ]. To support that strategy, yesterday, we registered a new $1 billion ATM program.
 Our fiscal year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance from a range of $6.45 to $6.65 to a new range of $6.70 to $6.80, which leaves us well positioned to grow earnings per share for the 22nd consecutive year. We expect the remaining contribution to fiscal '24 earnings per share to be recognized somewhat evenly by quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. This updated guiding range includes approximately $0.10 to $0.11 for the onetime Texas property tax benefit and approximately $0.07 for onetime Mississippi bad debt adjustment. When we initiate our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance in November, we will exclude the effect of both nonrecurring items. And we anticipate 6% to 8% earnings per share growth from this adjusted earnings per share amount.
 In addition to the onetime tax -- property tax and bad debt expense adjustments, I'd like to highlight a few additional items reflected in our revised guidance. From a revenue perspective, the winter heating season is over, and approximately 70% of our Distribution segment revenue has been recognized. Additionally, the most significant regulatory filings impacting fiscal '24 has been or will soon be completed. This gives us better line of sight into our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we are anticipating higher-than-planned customer growth and consumption for the fiscal year. 
 Going into the fiscal year, we anticipated residential customer growth to slow somewhat due to higher mortgage rates. However, that trend was not as pronounced as we had anticipated. Finally, we're anticipating higher throughput revenues at APT, net of the Rider REV benchmark, as spreads are expected to remain higher than we had originally anticipated.
 Partially offsetting these positive trends, we have increased our O&M range from $780 million to $800 million to a new range of $800 million to $820 million, inclusive of the Mississippi bad debt expense adjustment.
 As we said before, we are not a just-in-time compliance company, but we intend to stay ahead of our compliance work in the second half of the fiscal year to further enhance the safety and reliability of our system. We'll also perform some additional maintenance this summer to prepare for the upcoming winter heating season.
 Since most of the spending will be incurred in the back half of the fiscal year, we anticipate O&M for the third and fiscal fourth quarters to trend higher than the prior year's third and fiscal fourth quarters. Also included in this revised range is approximately $7 million for amortization of some regulatory assets after they are approved in the APT case in December. This increased amortization expense does not impact operating income, as we're reflecting an offsetting amount through rates.
 In addition to upgrading our earnings per share guidance, we have increased our capital spending guidance from approximately $2.9 billion to approximately $3.1 billion. Based on our ongoing assessment of our distribution and transmission systems, we've identified some additional system fortification that will be completed in advance of the next winter heating season. Additionally, the robust new housing market in North Texas that Kevin mentioned has modestly increased our gross spending.
 We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. We'll now open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. 
Richard Sunderland: Can you hear me? 
John Akers: Sure can. 
Richard Sunderland: Great. Thanks for all the clarifications around guidance and the changes there. I do just want to circle back to that and particularly the language around the roll forward of the growth rate at year-end, ex those nonrecurring items. Just for the sake of clarity, could you quantify again what those items are? And so just to be clear, those two items would then be removed from your year-end results for the purposes of calculating the growth rate on a [ 4 basis ], am I summarizing that correctly? 
Christopher Forsythe: You are. So just to kind of reemphasize. On the Texas property tax adjustment, we're anticipating that impact to be $0.10 to $0.11. Additionally, the Mississippi bad debt adjustment was about $0.07. So when we initiate our fiscal '25 guidance, wherever we land on a GAAP basis, we'll back off the $0.10 to $0.11 and the $0.07, and that will be the rebased or adjusted earnings per share from which we will launch our fiscal '25 guidance. And as I mentioned, we're anticipating 6% to 8% growth off of that adjusted amount. 
Richard Sunderland: Okay. Got it. Very helpful there. And then just to parse the '24 guidance changes a little more finely. If I'm recalling correctly from last quarter, you had said Mississippi was in the prior range and then Texas property tax, there had been a little uncertainty about whether it was all incremental or not, and now we're obviously getting that update today.
 So is the balance of the change relative to the $0.10 to $0.11 on the Texas side? Is it the customer growth and consumption in APT spreads that you referenced in the script? Or are there any other key things we should think about in terms of trends into '25 that you're kind of illuminating today? 
Christopher Forsythe: Okay. So lots to unpack there. So I think, again, on the $0.10 to $0.11 on the Texas property tax, that was really related to -- we're receiving the final valuations in our property tax valuations here in this quarter. And our team is working through what those final valuations will be for taxation purposes. So that's why there's a range there.
 On the Mississippi bad debt expense which we articulated last quarter, that was a onetime event, as a result of a regulatory change and how we recover those costs. And so again, that will -- going forward, that impact will no longer be reflected in our in our P&L, that the catch-up, if you will, related to primarily prior year periods because the adjustment dated back from April 2022, all the way through the end of calendar '23.
 So we had effectively recognized bad debt expense in the past that we were then allowed to reallocate back to our over under our GCA recovery balances on the balance sheet. So that was the reason for the pickups, and that's why it's a onetime event.
 And going forward, in terms of trends, we will update our fiscal '25 guidance here in the fall, and we'll see what happens. The summer was spread with customer growth, mortgage interest rates, and all that will be fully reflected in our '25 guidance, which we will launch later this fiscal year -- or later this calendar year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Jeffrey with Mizuho. 
Christopher Jeffrey: Maybe picking up on one of the other guidance item that was updated in the CapEx guidance went up about [ $20 million ]. And apologies if you talked about it in the call already, but any kind of color there as to what kind of the spread between distribution or pipeline or anything else... 
John Akers: Yes, it's a little hard to understand your question there, but I think [indiscernible], you're asking about the spreads on the pipeline. Obviously, at different times throughout the year, there will be maintenance on various other takeaway capacity. That's what we've seen over the last few weeks to months and anticipate several other pipelines to have additional maintenance, which is driving some negative spreads coming out of Waha, I believe, this morning.
 Today's cash [ prices ] were negative $2.30. Couple of pipelines have again announced further maintenance into this month, maybe into the following month as well, which will continue to show those wider spreads for the next few week period. And Chris mentioned those in his remarks as well. So we expect it to clear up later toward the summer period. 
Christopher Jeffrey: One of my questions was about spreads on the pipeline. So maybe to clarify my last question, the CapEx guide for '24 increased from the last update. I was just hoping further color on what's driving the increase in which businesses? 
John Akers: Yes, as we normally do. What drives our CapEx is our safety and reliability investment. And again, Chris mentioned in his remarks that we had identified several projects before heading into the heating season that we would like to complete for reliability measures that are out there. And our team continues to evaluate safety projects that are out there or pipe programs across our various jurisdictions. We'll further identify those as we head toward our update near the October-November time frame on 2025. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And it looks like there are no further questions. So at this point, I will turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks. Dan? 
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. The recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thanks, Dan. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-02-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us – for joining our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 26 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. I want to begin today's call by thanking all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions recently. And thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2024 first quarter net income of $311 million or $2.08 per diluted share and our first fiscal quarter capital spending was $770 million to support continued system modernization and growth across our service territories. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, we added over 58,000 new customers with over 44,000 of those located here in Texas. And the Texas Workforce Commission reported in January that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over $14.1 million. Texas once again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 370,000 jobs in calendar 2023, representing a 2.7% annual growth rate. Additionally, we added 11 new industrial customers, which when fully operational, we anticipate consuming approximately 2.5 Bcf of gas annually, that is volumetrically equivalent to 45,000 residential customers. Commercial customer growth remained solid as well with over 1,000 commercial customers connecting to the system during the first quarter. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territories. In APT, we completed several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. During the quarter, we placed in service line PC which connected the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our 22-mile 36-inch line PC supports the current demand and forecasted growth to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties located in Texas as well as increases supply diversity in this service area. Additionally, we placed in service Phase 3 of our 4-phase 104-mile line S2 project. As a reminder, line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. This third phase replaced 22 miles a 14-inch and 20-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this calendar year. And we completed the first phase of our Line WA Loop project, 24 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This multiphase project will fortify APT system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex by installing approximately 80 miles of 36-inch transmission pipeline. Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers during the first quarter. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first quarter. Through those efforts, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers received over $5 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2023, our energy assistance teams helped over 60,000 customers receive over $29 million of financial assistance to help with their monthly bill. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I want to comment on an incident that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The incident occurred at a Jackson, Mississippi residents on January 24 and resulted in one fatality. Atmos Energy is working with the National Transportation Safety Board and other federal and state regulators to help determine possible causes. We want to thank the first responders and emergency responders for their support and assistance. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers have been and continue to be with the family. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings per share was $2.08, which represents an 8.9% increase over the $1.91 per share reported in the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating income increased to $399 million or 24% in the first quarter. This performance was driven by several factors. Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $84 million. Residential commercial customer growth, combined with higher industrial loads increased operating income by an additional $6 million. Consolidated O&M expense decreased $19 million, primarily driven by lower bad debt expense. In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission modified how we recover uncollectible customer accounts. Previously, we have recovered these costs through a stable rate filing over a 12-month period. Effective April of 2022, we will now recur these costs for purchased gas cost mechanism over 24-month period, which will benefit our customers. As a result of this change, we reduced our bad debt expense by $14 million during the first quarter. Additionally, with this change, we now collect the bad debt portion of our uncollectible accounts through our purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms 88% of our customer base. O&M decreased an additional $5 million, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work at APT that we highlighted last fiscal year. Finally, operating income was favorably impacted by a legislative change in Texas to reduce property tax expenses. In the summer of 2023, the Texas legislature voted to allocate $18 million of the state's budget surplus to offset property taxes assessed on residential commercial property owners for calendar years 2023 and 2024. This legislation became effective during our first fiscal quarter after voters approved the legislation in November. In fiscal 2024, we expect this legislation will reduce our property tax expense by $20 million to $22 million. We recognize approximately $6 million of this impact during the first quarter. This reduction was not reflected in the fiscal 2024 earnings per share guidance we issued in November. We continued to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $167 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. This amount includes the $27 million associated with APT’s general rate case that was approved in December. We currently have about $61 million in progress and plan to make additional filings this fiscal year seeking $340 million to $370 million in annualized operating income increase. During the quarter we completed over $1.1 billion of long-term debt and equity financing, highlighted by the $900 million long-term debt financing we completed in October 2023. Additionally, we settled $254 million in equity forward agreement. This financing provides the necessary funding for our operations, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and overall financial profile. Our equity capitalization as of December 31 was 60% and we did not have any short-term debt outstanding. We also had $3.2 billion in available liquidity. This amount includes approximately $433 million of net proceeds available under existing foreign sale agreements, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal 2024 equity needs and a portion of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2025. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 18 years, with our next significant refinancing scheduled for June of 2027. And we continue to expect to have limited exposure to floating interest rates in fiscal 2024. Finally, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions or anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. As a reminder, the effective weighted average treasury rate of these swaps is 1.54%. In closing, we are off to a good start for the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans by our employees positions us well to sustain our success. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 earnings per share to be in the range $6.45 and $6.65 per share, inclusive of the favorable impact of the property tax legislation changes in Texas. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open the call up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Hope you’re doing well.
Kevin Akers: Good morning, David.
David Arcaro: Let’s see. I might have missed the details here. Could you just elaborate a bit on that property tax impact and the change? What EPS impact does that have for the full year this year? And did you say it’s not currently embedded in the EPS guidance?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. The property tax impact for the full fiscal year is expected to be between $20 million and $22 million pre-tax after taking into consideration the properties – the expected tax rates we put in our investor deck and the range of the share weighted average shares we have out there, we’re anticipating that impact between – to be between $0.09 and $0.11. And currently that is reflected in our current guidance. It was not reflected in our guidance previously.
David Arcaro: Okay, got it. Understood. Thanks for that color. Let’s see. Wanted to get your color on growth in customer additions. It sounds like you’ve continued to see strong customer additions in the quarter. I guess, what are your expectations for that continuing, just given what you’re seeing in building activities and the economic backdrop in your service territories?
Kevin Akers: Yes. In our conversations with our builders and developers, obviously we’re still in the winter period, so connections on existing housing will continue through this period, but would anticipate that activity picking back up as you head into spring and construction picking back up. But again, if you look at some of the studies that have been out there for quite a while, we’ve referenced on other calls, one in particular, there’s an anticipated 1 million additional people projected to come to the Metroplex by 2028. So we think that’ll definitely impact housing, which is already low on an existing home sale on the current market basis. I think the inventory right now is currently around two months or so. We’re told they like to keep that somewhere north of about four to five months worth of inventory, so we could see the builders again trying to meet that demand, picking things back up in the spring as we head into that construction season. And again, we continue to see good diversified growth across the territory, particularly on the industrial side, with those 11 that we added this previous quarter, coming from fertilizer industry, vegetable oils, concrete, asphalt plants, a good mixture of a lot of things across all eight states.
David Arcaro: Got it. That’s helpful color. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one more for me. I was wondering what your expectations are ahead of just a couple of the general rate cases you have later this year West Texas and MidTex. Just curious if there are any major things that you need to address, maybe out of the ordinary in those rate cases that would cause it to be a big ask or more contentious than usual?
Chris Forsythe: No, there’s nothing contentious or unusual. And as a reminder, these general rate cases are being filed because those jurisdictions are under our grit mechanism. Here in Texas, we have five consecutive filings that we have to make before we going back in to basically refresh and reset equity capitalization ROEs and the like. So we expect these to be fairly down the middle type of filings with nothing out of the ordinary unusual, and we’re planning to make those filings sometime later this calendar year.
David Arcaro: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Well done here. Look, just to follow-up on the first question. With respect to the tax change here, I mean, just are there other offsets? Do you think about this as being an opportunity to accelerate some work that you might have been contemplating for future periods here? Or is this kind of – really kind of expected to drop to the bottom line, if you will?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, that’s a good question, Julien. I mean, at this point, we’re sitting here in the middle of the winter heating season, which we’re beginning to think about what we look like going into the summer months in terms of compliance work and other activities that’s still all under evaluation right now. And we’ll have a better update for you in May.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Okay. Yes, fair enough. I get it. You’re not quite in the prime season. You got latitude here, curious to see what happens. To that end, though, if we can just – I know we’ve talked about the O&M backdrop a few different times since we’re talking about here. What are you seeing in terms of just as you plan ahead on this front, just being able to hold the line on the variety of different new customer costs and other factors that have driven up the inflationary bucket of late. I know that this inflation conversation is impacting over your peers. How are you thinking about that today here, especially within that range?
Kevin Akers: Yes, Julien, I mean, again, we stand by what we have out there in our deck and what we’ve talked about before in our 3% to 3.5% range that’s out there. Obviously, we have folks out on the system ensuring reliability this past winter storm with Heather, which I think we did an exceptional job of continuing to serve our customers out there in that historic winter storm. So we’ll continue to evaluate opportunities, whether those are hydrostatic tests on APT, compliance work across the system. So at this point, we’re still comfortable with the range we have out there and where we set the first quarter into the fiscal year.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. All right. Well, guys, and just one quick follow-up here, if I can, since you mentioned, we’re still here in the sort of winter season. Obviously we saw winter dynamics play themselves out in recent weeks across some of your – a good chunk of your service territory. Any considerations about how your system performed and/or commentary about how that positions you? Again, I get that a lot of this is ultimately just servicing your customers here and flow throughs, numerous set of riders across your jurisdictions. But any commentary about the experience in recent weeks, obviously in sharp contrast to some prior years here. 
Kevin Akers: Yes, as I said at our opening, very proud of all 5000 Atmos Energy employees. I think we did an exceptional job with this winter storm. The severity that it came in, I think depending on where you want to look at for heating degree day data, it was some 78% colder than normal in some locations, 200% colder than last year. So again, this takes a sustained period of investment in infrastructure improvement across your system. Obviously we did a lot of projects from last year, but we've been at this now for over 12 years. Improving our infrastructure, that's what allows us to be able to serve during these historic periods when they come in. You just can't do that overnight. I think our team's done a good job of identifying opportunities throughout the years and executing on those projects, but also very proud of our product. Look, for that week, I think we set a record across the country at a 174 Bcf of natural gas, with a peak of 72 Bcf for residential and commercial. So again, very proud of natural gas and what it does. And I think if you look at the energy output for that week, according to EIA, natural gas, petroleum and coal consumed 85% of the energy demand for that period. So very proud of what we continue to do as an industry.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Well, we'll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Richard Sunderland: Hi, good morning and thank you for the time today. I'd like to circle back on the property tax item one more time, if I could, just to be clear on that benefit. Is what you quantified the full amount of the benefit, or is that net of any reserves for return to customers? How are you thinking about that latter portion?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. That number is the benefit relative to our guidance for fiscal 2024. We don’t have I mean, what will happen is for accounting purposes; we recognize the impact in this fiscal year. Over the next couple two and a half years, we'll return that benefit back to our customers through our various mechanisms here in Texas. So it's really a temporary timing difference, if you will, but it does impact our financial results for fiscal 2024. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll have an update on what we think that will impact us for the full fiscal year later this fiscal year – I guess primarily in our next call. 
Richard Sunderland: Okay, understood. Very helpful color there. Thank you. And then just turning to the Fort Worth incident, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the site status. Just seen some media headlines around debris removal. Any current color there would be helpful. Also, who is currently investigating?
Kevin Akers: The site, I believe has been turned over according to the articles that we're seeing. The information that's been related to us back to the owners of it, I believe, and they're in charge of the removal at this point. And obviously you've seen our statements out there, our press release that our system has been tested and was not involved.
Richard Sunderland: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.
Nick Campanella: Hey everyone, thanks for taking my question and sorry to ask about property taxes, but I just wanted to triple check what's the negative offset to that $0.09 to $0.11 property tax in the guide for 2024?
Chris Forsythe: Well, right now, Nick, as we talked about a couple of minutes ago, we're still in the middle of the winter heating season. We need to see how our margins hold up as we move into January, February, March. We still evaluating our O&M needs for the fiscal year. So we felt it was prudent to maintain the guidance in this range at this point and provide a more thorough update once we get through the winter heating season.
Nick Campanella: Hey, I really appreciate that. And then Chris, I know you said in your prepared remarks you're fully priced for 2024 equity needs. How much is remaining left to do for 2025 before you've kind of taken care of that fully?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, we still have ways to go on that for legal reasons, I can't say precisely how much it's been priced, but under the terms of the agreements that we have in place. But we will just continue to stay ahead of our equity needs through the ATM throughout this fiscal year in preparation for FY 2025.
Nick Campanella: Got it. And then just one last one for me. I know that the LDC M&A market continues to be active and there's potentially even processes going around in states that are either adjacent or in your current territories. I’m just – can you just remind everyone what your kind of – your message is around M&A and your philosophy there? Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Sure. Be glad to. Again, we've talked about our growth on every call here for several years now. We continue to grow at close to 2% or above 2%, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division there. So we have that mechanism with good organic growth. You couple that with the rate construct that we have, where we start to earn on 90% of our investment in six months, 99% in 12 months. It's hard for us to see any sort of deal that could compete with the growth and regulatory construct that we have. So we're very proud of our systems, what we do, our relationships, our execution on that. So at this point we are continuing to focus on and remain dedicated to system modernization.
Nick Campanella: All right. Can't say I expected a different answer. So that's very much in line. Thank you so much. Have a great day.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.
Ryan Levine: Hi, everybody.
Kevin Akers: Morning.
Ryan Levine: Is there any color you could share around what you're seeing in the legislative sessions and across your service territories? Is there any bills that are being proposed that you're watching closely or that could have an impact on your business or outlook?
Kevin Akers: All right. I think it's still very early in a session. Those just really kicked off in some of our jurisdictions. We'll continue to monitor those, but at this point we'll let them go about their required activity and duties and we'll continue to monitor.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the pipelines or LDC network itself, are you seeing any jurisdictions that are looking to rerate some types that may be classified as transmission to distribution or anything along those lines?
Kevin Akers: No, we're not is the short answer to the question? Again, I believe those are all business decisions based upon the regulations at the federal level and the state level.
Ryan Levine: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Chris Jeffrey: Hi, this is Chris Jeffrey on for Gabe. Just one quick one on the O&M side. Just seemed like there was a change in the bad debt expense treatment that came through on the quarter. Wondering, is that all kind of realized now? Or will that continue to flow through future periods? And was that contemplated in the original guide?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, so the – I’m sorry property [ph] tax, too many questions are property tax on the bad debt expense that $14 million or so that we referenced, that was basically the impact for this fiscal year. We had hoped that that would come through. So that was basically reflecting in our guide. 
Chris Jeffrey: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.
Dan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. And again, thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through March 31. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com, under the Investor Relations tab.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 37 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.  I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy.  As Saturday is Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces and those currently serving. Approximately 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are a part of the nearly 20 million Americans who bravely served our country. Thank you all for your service.  Yesterday, we reported our earnings per share of $6.10, which represents the 21st consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call.  I will begin today's call highlighting a few of the many accomplishments achieved in fiscal '23 and we'll close with a few updates on key pipeline projects and some thoughts about fiscal '24.  This past October 18 marked Atmos Energy's 40th anniversary as an independent company. We continue to build on the past and focus on the future, and be guided by the simple values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan, of honesty, integrity and good moral character, and supported for more than a quarter of century by our culture atmosphere. These values, combined with the laser focus of our 5,000 dedicated employees on our vision, continue to benefit our customers, our communities and the environment.  I've said it before, and I will say it again today, our employees are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company.  In fiscal '23, we continue to execute our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '23 capital investment of over $2.8 billion, supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 900 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 47,000 service loans. This investment also supported the strong economic development we continue to see in our service territories.  In fiscal '23, we added nearly 61,000 new customers, with over 46,000 of those new customers located here in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.5 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 436,000 from September 2022 to September 2023.  And according to a study recently conducted by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add over 674,000 people by 2028, to reach 8.5 million, while the Austin Round Rock Georgetown Corridor is projected to add over 324,000 people by 2028, to reach 2.7 million.  In fiscal '23, we continue to see good commercial growth as well, adding nearly 3,000 new commercial customers. Our industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories has also remained strong. In fiscal '23, we added 55 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 19 Bcf, once they are fully operational. The 19 Bcf of annual usage is equivalent to adding nearly 367,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.  We continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system to support this growth during fiscal '23. We completed Phases 2 and 3 of our 4-phase, 104-mile Line S-2 project. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place, to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex.  Additionally, we completed the final 63-mile portion of our 137-mile, 36-inch, Line X integrity replacement project. We also completed our third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity.  We remain on track to complete Line PC by the end of the calendar year. This 22-mile, 36-inch line will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our new line will support current demand and the forecasted growth, as well as increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties in Texas.  Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service, and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. The Atmos Energy team continues to build trust as they help nearly 62,000 customers receive over $29 million in energy assistance funds. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers each and every day.  Finally, through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives, our employees made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals, Macs, as we also honored our health care workers, first responders and helped our neighbors in need by supporting more than 1,409 profits.  And for over 200 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources our team provided translated into nearly 5.5 million meals being served to our neighbors in need. And we continue to partner with local Habitat for Humanity organization to provide families with Zero Net Energy Homes. These homes are designed to produce more energy than they consume through the use of high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials.  We completed 2 new Zero Net Energy Homes in fiscal '23, and we'll have completed 12 total ZNE homes by the end of fiscal '24. These homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner, and is another way Atmos Energy fuel safe and thriving communities.  I'm very proud of Atmos Energy and our full team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to Chris to discuss our fiscal '23 financial results, our fiscal '24 guidance, and an updated 5-year plan through fiscal '28. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '23 earnings per share of $6.10 increased 8.9% over fiscal '22. Our performance continues to reflect the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies.  In fiscal '23, we implemented $269 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liability. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '22, increased operating income by $254 million this fiscal year. Strong customer growth, higher consumption and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $30 million.  Consolidated O&M increased $55 million to $765 million, largely driven by higher levels of service orders and increased head count to support our growing service territory, primarily in Texas. This thing came in at the lower end of our updated guidance range as we saw some moderation in inflation in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.  Fiscal '23 capital spending of $2.8 billion represent a 15% increase over the prior fiscal year, 85% of that spend was dedicated to improve the safety and reliability of our system. As a result of this spending, our rate base increased by 18% and estimated $16.6 billion as of September 30.  Finally, we completed $1.6 billion of long-term financing and completed the securitization process in Kansas and Texas. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61.5% and approximately $2.7 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well positioned to support our future operations.  Looking forward, our strategy continues to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, seeking timely recovery of our costs through our regulatory mechanisms, while financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, mitigate financing risk and minimizing the cost of financing to our customers. We anticipate the execution of this strategy will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth.  For fiscal '24, we anticipate earnings per share will be between $6.45 and $6.65, and we anticipate fiscal '28 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.35 and $8.75. Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 160th consecutive quarterly cash dividend as an indicated fiscal '24 annual dividend of $3.22, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '23. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $17 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which is expected to increase estimated rate base by approximately -- to approximately $29 billion in fiscal '28.  In addition to our capital spending, another significant use of cash will be for taxes. We expect to refund $300 million of excess deferred tax liabilities over the next 5 years, with approximately 70% of this amount be funded during fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. And we anticipate we will become a material federal cash tax payer within the next 3 years because of 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in The Inflation Reduction Act. Our O&M spending will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  We have assumed O&M inflation of 3.5% annually through fiscal '28, from fiscal '23 levels. For fiscal '24, we anticipate O&M to range from $780 million to $800 million. This 5-year plan includes approximately $10 million of incremental long-term debt and financing, which has been reflected in our earnings per share guidance for both fiscal '24 and fiscal '28.  Following completion of our $900 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt stood at 4.1%, and our debt maturity schedule is very manageable. Our weighted at maturity is 18.4 years, and our next significant tranche of debt is not scheduled to mature until June of 2027.  Additionally, our financing strategy does not contemplate material exposure to floating rate interest rates. To further mitigate interest rate risk, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions of our anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and '26. The effective weighted average rate of these swaps is 1.59%.  Finally, we intend to continue utilizing our ATM program to meet our equity financing needs. As of September 30, we have priced $467 million which represents a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 equity need. Handling recovery of our costs remains a key component of our strategy. We are off to a good start in fiscal '24.  Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we had implemented $113 million in annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, and we have 5 filings in progress taking about $137 million. Included in this amount is $107 million requested in APT's general rate case.  On October 24, APT and the intervening parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement proposes a rate base of $4.3 billion, an authorized rate of return of 8.49%, equity capitalization of 60.44% and an authorized ROE of 11.45%.  We anticipate the settlement agreement will be on the commission's agenda for the December 13 meeting. If approved as filed, this settlement would result in a $27 million increase in annualized operating income. We remain confident the execution of this strategy, will continue to support our ability to modernize our system and to support the continued economic development in our service territories. Our customers will continue to benefit from this strategy as we expect our average residential bill will remain one of the most competitively priced utility bills in our customers' health.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin to say some closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. And as you've heard this morning, a successful fiscal '23 has us well positioned for fiscal '24.  As part of our $2.9 billion fiscal '24 capital spending plan, APT will continue to focus on enhancing the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of its system. APT will continue to work on the remaining 40 miles of the Line S-2, 36-inch pipeline project, which we anticipate having the final phase in service by December of 2024.  In fiscal '23, APT began a multiphase Line WA Loop project that will install approximately 80 miles of 36-inch pipeline supported by the northern part of the system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase 1, approximately 24 miles is anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year. Design is underway for Phase 2, which will install an additional 40 miles and we anticipate that Phase 2 will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025. Phase 3 will include the installation of the final 16 miles, and we anticipate that, that phase will be placed into service by the end of calendar year 2026.  Additionally, in fiscal '24, APT will begin construction of a 54-mile, 36-inch pipeline from our Bethel storage facility to our Groesbeck compressor station to support forecasted growth in Williamson and Travis Counties in Central Texas. We anticipate that the project will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025.  Our gas supply team has us well positioned for this upcoming heating season to supply reliability and at competitive prices. Our gas supply team has hedged 50% of our winter supply needs, through a combination of storage and financial contracts, at a weighted average cost of $3.31.  I'm very excited about the direction and long-term stability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yields 6% to 8% fully-regulated earnings per share and commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of investment in natural gas infrastructure, with 96% of our rate base situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice.  We have a long runway of work to support the planned $17 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as we continue to modernize our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems.  As Chris noted, most of our fiscal '24 financing costs are known, and we have hedged $900 million of our financing needs beyond fiscal 2024. The strength of our balance sheet and available liquidity will continue to support our operations in a cost-effective manner for our customers.  Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play in every community, safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays.
Nicholas Campanella: Congrats on the anniversary here. So I guess to start, you've been fairly programmatic in how you issue equity and acknowledging kind of 2024 is largely priced here as well. How do we kind of think about future issuances just given the size of the capital plan seems to go up every year, that's likely going to pressure equity higher. Are you still very comfortable that you can do this all with ATM? Or would you consider other means?
Christopher Forsythe: Nick, it's Chris. Yes, right now, we remain pretty confident that we can still use the ATM to fund those equity needs. As you know, we have a balanced financing strategy. We're certainly looking at a number of factors that's -- cost of the customer, the strength of the balance sheet which supports credit ratings, credit facilities, our ability to finance attractively in the capital markets and equity is a component of that. So we're certainly looking at that particular tool. I mean, we have other tools available to us if needed. But at this time, given the liquidity that we have in the market, we believe we can satisfy those needs through the ATM.
Nicholas Campanella: Got it. That's super helpful. And then congrats on the APT settlement. I guess just are you reflecting that current settlement outcome in the 6% to 8% guidance here? Or do you wait until December 12?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, that has been contemplated in the guidance we issued yesterday.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.
Richard Sunderland: Am I coming through clearly?
Kevin Akers: You are.
Richard Sunderland: Great. Following up on the financing side, just curious if 50% to 60% equity capitalization is still the target to think about? Or is 60% more appropriate given the outcome on the APT side?
Christopher Forsythe: So we look at the balance sheet holistically across all of our jurisdictions, as well as what we need to continue to support our credit ratings. So we have skewed towards the upper end of a 50% to 60% range now for the last few years. we're comfortable to be in that range, and that's kind of where we anticipate being over the next 5 years.
Richard Sunderland: Understood. And then turning to the O&M side, you laid out a little bit of this in the script, but just curious if you could parse the recent O&M trends a little bit more. How much of 2H is moderation versus timing? And then how much conservatism is or is not baked into that 2024 outlook?
Kevin Akers: I mean, again, we've been at this 3% to 3.5% projection on O&M now for quite a long time. We feel comfortable in that range. As you know, we've used different levers over time when needed to mitigate any of the O&M pressures that we see coming down the road. And again, with some of the additional pullback in some of our service territories in the housing market, we've seen line locates costs come down, we've seen other compliance costs come down. So we remain confident as we head into '24 right now that what we have projected out there, of the $780 million to $800 million, we feel very confident in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen of Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: Maybe if I can also stick on the O&M topic just a little bit. You addressed it a bit, but I noticed that the long-term O&M guidance went a little -- smidge higher, but it sounds like you're very confident at least in the near-term outlook for sort of your O&M cost. Can you just address that long-term guidance in the context of sort of what you're seeing near term and how you felt? Maybe a little -- needed to nudge it up a little bit?
Kevin Akers: Yes, again, I'll reiterate what I said previously. There towards the last quarter, we saw some of the line locating requests drive down just a few percentage points in some of our jurisdictions. Even though here in Texas, we saw an 8% increase. So that's what we were looking at there. That certainly reduced some of our compliance costs. Then again with some of our other compliance activity and timing of those sort of things, we think we've got a good handle on what the next year, the 3- to 5-year window looks like on planned O&M activity, compliance activity, those sort of things. So those were some of the drivers we were looking at that came out of the last quarter and allowed us to stay in that 3% to 3.5% range and at $780 million to $800 million O&M.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. And Gabe, I'll add to that. There's a lot of compliance work that we still have to do as a utility. The rules continue to become more stringent. So we're anticipating some of that in the 3.5%. A little bit to higher -- a little bit higher inflation than we've had in the past, although it has moderated somewhat in the third and fourth quarters. And as a final reminder, with our annual mechanisms that we have in several of our jurisdictions, we had the opportunity to recover that fairly timely, generally within a year. So it shouldn't be a significant drag if approved for those annual mechanisms as we anticipate.
Gabriel Moreen: Got it. And maybe if I can also ask in the context of becoming a cash taxpayer over the next couple of years. Is there anything you can do kind of as an offset, whether from a corporate level or from a regulatory standpoint, to offset maybe some of the cash impact there?  And then maybe also bigger picture, just what you're assuming sort of on interest rates and recoverability from a cost of capital standpoint, over the next couple of years given how dramatically rates have shifted, I guess, since the last 5-year uptake?
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. I'll address the cash taxes first. First, we've got excess deferred taxes as I mentioned. That's beginning to tail off kind of after a couple of years. The IRA for us expects we should kick in, in the mid part of the 5-year plan, and that's predicated on just to the continued growth of the company. Fortunately, there aren't a lot of levers for us to pull. It's really a 15%, or you end up becoming a cash taxpayer as we begin to burn off some of the NOL shield that we have. And that's been contemplated in our plan.  So we knew going into this plan that we had either 15% or the fact that NOL shields were going to be becoming lower. So there's not a lot of levers we can do. Our tax team is obviously looking at opportunities for tax planning strategies. It's too soon to say if there's anything material that will come from that. But right now, we have conservatively estimated what will be a full cash -- federal cash tax payer have in the middle part of our 5-year plan. With respect to interest rate costs, we certainly have reflected what we believe are current market conditions in the 5-year plan. I'll also just remind you that we have the $900 million in hedges at a weighted average treasury cost of about 1.59%. That's a significant portion of our anticipated FY '25 needs and a fair amount of our anticipated FY '26 need.  So AMT will continue to look for opportunities to lock in some hedges, but given the higher elevated or where the interest rates are right now, it may not be as prudent or as attractive to do so as it was a couple of years ago, when rates were in the sub-2% range.
Kevin Akers: Yes. I just want to reemphasize that the plan does reflect, as Chris said, they're us becoming a tax cash payer out in that time frame. So that's all backed into the plan that's out there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just maybe picking up where Gabe left off there. Just on the question of taxes, if you don't mind. What about -- for income statement purposes, how do you think about effective tax rate here? I mean, obviously, the comment is about going to a full cash taxpayer here in the next 3 years, certainly relevant from financing. But how do you think about the uptick, obviously, from '23 to '24, and then from there on out, in terms of the effective tax rate on the income statement. Obviously, I get that some of that over time is going to be subsumed back into the regulated cost structure. But I'm just curious on how you would set expectations and if there's any kind of question about recovery and timing there, as well in the next few years as you see that uptick?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. We'll certainly see an uptick in the effective income tax rate. Again, that's being influenced right now, certainly the last 2 or 3 years with these excess of deferred tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate 2 years ago was in the 11% range, it ticked up closer to 15%. And we'll end up being in that 22% to 23% range here in the not-too-distant future. Again, all of these costs, we believe, are recoverable, including the IRA corporate minimum tax and our regulatory and tax teams are working on strategies right now to begin dialogue with those regulators to educate them on where that is in terms of what the law requires and then what the recoverability might look like.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Right. So regulatory strategy on the come here but not overly concerned about what that does in terms of, like maybe a lag headwind here in, call it, '25 and '26 as you kind of get to that more normalized level, if you will?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, correct. Not material impact. And again, all that's been reflected in the guidance for FY '24 through to FY '28.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Very much appreciated. And then just on the O&M side, I just wanted to understand, as you think about that normalized, I think you said 3% to 3.5%. Like, how do you think about what is going on in the context of line locates within that composition through the future? I mean, obviously, that's been elevated here. You saw a little bit of reprieve. How do you think about that contributing to that normalized level versus this just being the new norm? Or is there an elevated line locate just embedded in that 3 to 3.5 year?
Kevin Akers: Julien, it's part of our ongoing strategy with whether they're contractors or internal labor. We always look at what's going on in the market where we have contracts as we look at those on an annual basis to see if they need adjustment, forecasted work for them, and any strategic opportunities we may have to in-source opportunities there to offset some of the cost taking a longer-term view.  So all those options remain on the table as they have in the past, but we continue to look at these on an annual basis. So that's where we get the comfort in that range that we put out there right now.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Fair enough. But it's not like you have some meaningful further uptick in line locates or something like that, that we should be aware of here?
Kevin Akers: Now again, with the growth that I talked about on the front end and the population and trending that we've seen out there, that's all been baked into the plan out there, all the labor or anticipated labor, the current contracts we have in place, the labor rates that are out there right now, we have baked all that into the plan.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. And the 3.5% annual increase is off of FY '23 levels kind of starting at that elevated level already.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine of Citi.
Ryan Levine: I want to follow up on the O&M getting a little more granular. In terms of the outlook, it's more on an annual basis. But can you speak to maybe the seasonality attributes of the O&M outlook. Should we look to -- this most recent fiscal year as indicative of seasonality trends on a go-forward basis? Is there anything else to call out?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, there's that. On the O&M, there is some element of seasonality. It's difficult to predict because we are managing our O&M over the entire fiscal year. So for example, like last fiscal year, where we had -- at the start of the year, we had crews in place, kind of doing some in-line inspection work at APT at the end of fiscal '22. It made good business sense to go ahead and continue that work into fiscal '23, although it had been planned originally to be in the back end of fiscal '23, rather than to demobilize the crews and remobilize 6 or 9 months later, we needed budget, we decided to go ahead and discontinue forward. So that was an operating decision that we made that we thought was in the best interest of the company and our customers. And so we make those decisions on a day in and day out basis. So it's difficult to predict. Certainly, those larger expenses when those could occur within a quarter. But certainly, we're managing to our full fiscal year results. Same thing on line locates. Kevin talked about seeing some moderation right now that we're seeing, but 6 months from now, we can be in a different environment and line locating may pick up for any number of reasons. And we, again, try to manage that on a full fiscal year basis. But quarter-by-quarter, we're not as focused on how to get this work done in a quarter unless there's a specific time requirement. But again, we are well ahead of our compliance deadlines which gives us the opportunity to manage from a full fiscal year basis.
Kevin Akers: Yes, Ryan, the other thing I'd say, Chris, is spot on with that is, we do -- given the economic growth that we've seen across our service territory, there are times when jurisdictions would want to pull forward projects, whether they're water, sewer related or there's fiber things going on, fiber projects out there that we'll have to move and adjust to as well based upon their time line. It may not be seasonably ratable, but it may be in a quarter it may show up. So again, we have to get the work done when we need to get the work done and work with our communities to make sure we're in concert with their projects as well.
Ryan Levine: Great. And maybe just one other. In terms of within Texas with the Railroad Commission, is there any discussion around consolidating jurisdictions or regulatory constructs as you negotiate outcomes on a go-forward basis?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. We're aware of some filings that are out there kind of looking at that opportunity. We're looking at those right now and seeing at that, would make -- potentially makes sense for us. But we're aware of what others are trying to do at this point in time.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Dan Meziere for some closing remarks.
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December 31. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Aaron, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere. Dan, please go ahead.
Daniel Meziere : Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 34 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share of $5.33 compared to $5.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third quarter and fiscal year-to-date financial results were in line with our expectations and continue to be driven by three key themes. Regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending, continued strong customer growth and higher O&M spending.  Fiscal '22 and '23 regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by approximately $204 million. And higher consumption, residential customer growth and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $27 million. These increases were partially offset by a $70 million increase in consolidated O&M. Year-to-date, distribution O&M increased $48 million or 12.6%. However, during the third fiscal quarter, the rate of O&M increase in this segment moderated somewhat with O&M increasing approximately 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. The higher levels of O&M spending continues to be largely driven higher levels of service orders to support growing service territory, primarily in Texas. Fiscal year-to-date, we experienced an 8% increase in the number of [indiscernible] located in Texas and we continue to see higher labor costs for these third-party services. Additionally, service orders increased 10%, largely driven by customer growth and increased collection activities. The remaining $22 million fiscal year-to-date increase in consolidated O&M incurred in our Pipeline and Storage segment, primarily driven by the timing of in-line inspection work for this segment. In the prior fiscal year, most network was concentrated in the fourth quarter. In this fiscal year, this work was incurred more regularly throughout the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 21% or $358 million to $2.1 billion with 86% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects higher spending of APT for Line S-2 and Line PC projects designed to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system. Spending in our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety reliability spending and higher spending to support customer growth. During our third fiscal quarter, we implemented $122 million of annualized regulatory outcomes. Year-to-date, we have now completed $263 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we currently have an additional $263 million in annualized outcomes in progress, including $107 million related to our APT general rate case that we filed in May of this year. We currently expect to finalize that case in December of 2023.  Our financial position continues to remain strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.8%, approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. This amount includes $590 million of net proceeds available under existing foreign sales agreement that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs in a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs. Additionally, during our third fiscal quarter, we completed our $95 million securitization process in Kansas, again including securitization charge on customer bills effective July 1. As I previously mentioned, our third quarter and fiscal year-to-date results were in line with our expectations, which gives us the confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance in the range of $6 to $6.10. Additionally, we now expect capital spending to approximate $2.8 billion, largely reflecting higher spending per system expansion in our distribution segment. Thank you for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal year performance reflects the continued dedication of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees in executing our proven safety and reliability investment strategy. Through their commitment, focus and effort, we are modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers in 1,400 communities across our eight states.  We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends, particularly in Texas. For the 12 months ended June 30, we added nearly 64,000 new customers with just over 48,000 of those new customers located here in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the State continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended May 31, the number of employed reached a new record high at nearly 14.4 million, leading the country in number and percentage of jobs added.  Additionally, according to a study by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add one million people by 2028 to reach nearly 8.5 million people here in the Metroplex. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory also remained strong. During the third quarter, we added 10 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 8 Bcf once they're fully operational.  Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 41 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 16 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that 16 Bcf of anticipated load is equivalent to adding nearly 294,000 residential customers. Finally we continued our outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers. During the first nine months of fiscal year, our Customer Advocacy team and customer support agents helped over 55,000 customers receive about $23 million in funding assistance.  Our continued focus on long-term sustainability, combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financing strategy has us positioned well for another successful year in fiscal 2023, and reflects the vital role we play in every community, providing safe, reliable and efficient natural gas service to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard, please go ahead.
Richard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? 
Kevin Akers: Yes, good morning.
Daniel Meziere: Yes, we can.
Richard Sunderland: Great. Thank you. Starting with the O&M trends, can you speak to the year-to-date trends relative to the implied 4Q outlook here? There's certainly a pretty stark reversal kind of embedded in the numbers. I know you referenced inspection work, but just curious if there are other timing factors at play. Also if you've done work to derisk '24, and that's part of the outlook for the balance of the year as well.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Thank you, Rich. We'll start with '23. Again, a lot of the timing is related to the APT and line section work that I referenced just a couple of minutes ago, and again, more of that work was ratable this year in the first half year, the fiscal year primarily compared to last year. It was more concentrated in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into fiscal '24, we're still pulling together that five-year plan that we are looking for opportunities to derisk that a little bit in terms of, on the distribution side. Looking at how we might approach line locate the strategy there, as well as just trying to lock in some longer contracts and some of our service contracts that are third party by design.  And so those are some things that we're looking at to try to mitigate some increases going forward.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. Very helpful color there. And then shifting to the APT rate case, curious on any early thoughts on stakeholder engagement, what you're hearing locally. What is the timing for settlement discussions just procedurally in that case? And any expectations around your ability to reach settlement?
Kevin Akers: Yes, Richard, this is Kevin. I'll start out. We're right on pace with the procedural schedule as it's outlined there. We're still continuing to get data requests. We're responding to those. So at this point, if you look at the procedural schedule, we feel like we're on track to get an order some time toward the end of the calendar year in that December time frame.
Richard Sunderland: And then just high-level thoughts on ability to reach a settlement here? Is that something that's embedded in the plan? Anything you could say on that front would be helpful.
Kevin Akers: No. Again, we're still continuing to answer questions at this point. We'll see how we progress over the next few weeks or so. But at this point, again, I think we're on track with the outlined procedural schedule.
Richard Sunderland: Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you for the time today.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan, please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Hi, everybody. I guess a couple on O&M costs. I appreciate the comments already made, but on a go-forward basis, should we be expecting the seasonality of operating costs to be more like this year or prior years? And kind of what's driving some of the change in cadence.
Kevin Akers: Yes, Ryan. I think as you think about on a go forward, we certainly had anticipated going into '23, some of the inflationary costs. We knew we were going to have some growth. But if you look at the O&M was driven on a line locating, as Chris mentioned before. I would certainly anticipate that to continue. But I think we've got a good outlook on that now on where we stand on number of locates, type of other O&M expenses. As Chris said, as we move to finalize our '24 plan and look forward from that.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. The other thing, too, Ryan, I'll add is that a lot of this timing is just based upon the availability of the contractors to do the work. I've kind of talked about a little bit with APT work last year. We had a lot of work in the fourth quarter because the contractors are on site. They are working with us.  We decided to go ahead and move into the first and second quarter since they're already engaged with us rather than releasing them and have them come back six months later. So we also have to just work around the needs of the system, the timing of the system. It depends on what we might do on construction work on certain segments of the system, which could influence the timing.  I've also referenced service orders. A lot of those are difficult to forecast, but service orders generally related to particularly this last year, more calling into the customer contact center because of high bills, given the higher prices we experienced back in the winter heating season. Difficult to predict that, that will reoccur in the first or second quarter as well as some of our disconnection activities. That's why we manage to a full fiscal year in terms of guidance because some of those operating conditions are difficult to predict, and we're just responding to the needs of the business with an eye towards accomplishing our fiscal earnings per share targets.
Kevin Akers: Yes. And I think that's the other point, Ryan, here, as our communities, as you've heard us say, are growing, expanding out where we're working with them on timing of their projects, whether they are infrastructure projects or current [indiscernible]. You've got fiber optic projects out there, you've got road relocations, new road construction, that sort of thing going on. Some of this just cycle throughout the full fiscal year period.
Ryan Levine: And how much is this change in seasonality of costs that was embedded in that response is really related to the spike in gas prices during this most recent winter opposed to some of the other drivers that you highlighted?
Kevin Akers: Yes. I don't know that I would make that kind of direct correlation. I think what Chris was alluding to are some orders for reread, that sort of thing based on bills, but I don't think it's a meaningful percentage of the rest of the overall operational O&M per se.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then one, I noticed in your -- with your guidance for the year, you're approaching year-end, at least your fiscal year-end and the effective tax rate this year is supposed to be higher than last year. Is that from a longer-term planning perspective, are you anticipating that the current effective tax rate is appropriate for future time periods? Or any color you could share around how you're thinking about your tax position?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, Ryan. The effective tax rate that you see is roughly 11%. That's heavily influenced by the excess of -- the refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities from the TCJA. We're amortizing those over a three to five year period. So that's why we've included in our deck, kind of the marginal effective tax rate of roughly 22.5% to 23.5% per se. So that you have an idea of really what true tax impacts are if you're modeling your O&M or other types of expenses or revenues. But we do anticipate the GAAP effective tax rate to increase as the excess deferred taxes wind down here over the next couple of years and revert back to that more traditional 22% to 23.5%.
Ryan Levine: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this point, it does look like we are good on the questions. Dan, would you like me to turn it back over to you for closing remarks?
Daniel Meziere : Sure. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through September 30. Have a great day. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, Dan. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Mandy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?
John Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal 2023 net income of $630 million or $4.40 per diluted share. As you will hear from Chris, results were in line with our expectations and positions us for another successful fiscal year. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states. We also narrowed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6 to $6.10. We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends in Texas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we added 65,000 new customers across the company with nearly 49,000 of those new customers located in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment in March, adding 664,000 jobs since January of 2022 to reach a series high civilian labor force of 14.9 million people. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 18 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date we've added 30 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 15 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that 15 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 275,000 residential customers. To support that growth that I just summarized, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system. For example, in our Atmos Pipeline Texas division, our team completed the injection of working gas into Bethel cavern 1B, our third salt-dome cavern. This third cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. Work continues on Phase 3 of our Line S-2 project, which will replace 67 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. And as a reminder, this project brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Metroplex. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late 2024. Later this calendar year, we expect to complete the remaining 5 miles of the 22-mile project that will install a 36-inch pipeline connecting to the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This new line will support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties in Texas. Atmos Energy's comprehensive environmental strategy is focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the following 5 key focus areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. In the area of operations through our system modernization efforts, we are on track to place 800 to 1,000 miles of pipe this fiscal year and between 20,000 and 30,000 steel service lines. And in the gas supply area during the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, we added another RNG facility that will transport renewable natural gas across our system. We now have 7 flowing RNG facilities directly connected to our system. Additionally, we've executed interconnect agreements with 3 additional RNG projects expected to begin flowing in calendar year 2023. Once these projects are fully operational, we anticipate to have 8 to 9 Bcf of RNG flowing across our system annually. Finally, we are evaluating nearly 30 additional opportunities to connect RNG facilities to our system. As I mentioned on previous calls, we are partnering with Habitat for Humanity in each of our 8 states to build Zero Net Energy homes for families in need. Zero Net Energy Homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels an installation to produce more energy than they consume at an affordable cost. During the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, we completed 2 homes: 1 in Owensboro, Kentucky and 1 in Jackson, Mississippi. All 8 homes have achieved home energy rating system, or HERS, scores of less than 0, which means the homes produce more energy than they consume. These Zero Net Energy Homes demonstrate the value and vital role that natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner. Providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one of the ways Atmos Energy, fuel of safe and thriving communities. Our customer service organization and technology support team continue to innovate and look for ways to improve our customer service and offer convenient channels for customers to communicate with us and to make payments. For example, we see continuous growth in our electronic bill delivery channels with nearly 52% of customers enrolled in eBill, and approximately 85% of customers pay electronically with over 33% of them enrolled in recurring auto draft, which is 10% higher than industry average. We are also fueling safe and thriving communities through our continued outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, our customer advocacy team and customer support agents helped over 35,000 customers who received over $14 million in funding a system. The dedication and focus of our employees was recently recognized in an American Customer Satisfaction Index energy utility study conducted between January and December of last year. According to the recently released study, Atmos Energy finished in first place, leading all energy utility providers with the highest customer satisfaction score. We believe our focus, dedication and effort, combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financing strategy positions us well to safely deliver reliable efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and the industry to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone who joined us this morning. As previously mentioned, net income for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was $630 million or $4.40 per diluted share. Year-to-date consolidated operating income increased $744 million or 13%. I'll touch on a few of the highlights of our year-to-date performance. Fiscal '22 and '23 regulatory outcomes increased operating income by $152 million. Additionally, residential growth and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $12 million. And we saw a $7 million increase in APT's through-system business. Most of this increase occurred during our first fiscal quarter when spreads widened while some of the key takeaway pipelines in the Permian undergoing maintenance. Consolidated O&M expense increased $57 million. Distribution O&M increased $43 million, driven largely by supporting our growing service territory in Texas, where we experienced a 10% increase in the number of line locates. They're also seeing higher labor costs for these third-party services. Additionally, service orders system-wide have increased 11%, largely driven by customer growth, increased service requests driven by higher natural gas prices and increased collection activities. As a result, our internal labor costs have risen to fulfill these orders. Finally, we experienced higher levels of bad debt expense due to higher customer bills. Most of this increase was recognized during our second fiscal quarter. The remaining $14 million increase is recognized in our Pipeline and Storage segment, driven by the timing of in-line inspection work compared to the prior year period and increased employee costs. Slides 5 and 6 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Consolidated capital spending increased 19% or $225 million to $1.4 billion with 86% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects higher spending at APT, the projects that Kevin discussed just a few minutes ago. We continue to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $116 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we have about $298 million annualized outcomes in progress. We anticipate implementing about half of this amount during the second half of our fiscal year. Slides 20 through 31 summarize these outcomes and Slide 17 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our financial position continues to remain strong. In early March, we executed a $2 billion term loan to help repay our maturing $2.2 billion in senior notes. Later that month, the Texas Public Financing Authority completed its state-wide securitization program, and we used the proceeds from that program to pay off the term loan. We no longer have meaningful exposure to floating rate interest debt. We finished our second fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 60.9% and approximately $3.3 billion of liquidity. Included in this amount is $673 million in net proceeds available under existing foreign sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs. The strength of our financial profile was recognized by Moody's in March when they reaffirm the credit ratings and outlook. We continue to look for opportunities to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long-term debt financing needs beyond fiscal '23. In march and April of this year, we executed $250 million in starting interest rate swaps. We have now have $1.6 billion of swaps to effectively hedge portions of the treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.76% to 2.38%. With this activity, a substantial portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 long-term debt needs have now been hedged. Finally, in Kansas, we are still on track to complete our gas cost securitization this fiscal year. Additional details for our financing activities and our financial profile be found on Slides 9 through 11. Our fiscal year-to-date performance gives us confidence to narrow our fiscal '23 earnings per share guidance from $5.90 to $6.10 to the new guidance range of $6 to $6.10. We expect the contribution to fiscal '23 earnings to be somewhat ratable by quarter in the back half of the fiscal year. A few additional thoughts about our updated guidance. The winter heating season is over and approximately 70% of our distribution segment revenue has been recognized. Going into the fiscal year with elevated commodity costs, we anticipate lower customer consumption primarily due to conservation. However, the consumption we saw during the winter heating season exceeded our expectations. Additionally, the most significant regulatory filings impacting fiscal '23 has been or will soon be completed giving us a better line of sight into the regulatory outcomes for the fiscal year. Regarding O&M, much of this increase was anticipated as we originally guided to an approximate 5.5% increase over fiscal '22 levels. However, as I mentioned a few months ago, we are experiencing higher-than-planned spending to support our growing serous territories, particularly in Texas. This is was what we did during the panic, we are working to offset some of these increases. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of our updated guidance, we anticipate O&M for the remaining 6 months of the fiscal year to be in line with our level of spending in the back half of fiscal '22. Finally, our expected cost of financing is now pretty clear. Securitization Texas has been resolved and our expected long-term debt financing for the fiscal year is now complete. Further, we're anticipating higher-than-planned AEDC partly due to the timing of product closings within the fiscal year and remaining FY '23 equity needs have been fully priced. Details surrounding our fiscal '23 guidance can be found on Slides 13 and 14. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, nicely done, guys. I wanted to maybe kick things off quickly. Texas legislature looking at potentially using some of their surplus here potentially look at paying down some of the securitization here. Can you comment on that a little bit here? What are your expectations? Any nuances there? And then ultimately, I would presume that this would effectively never hit customer bills, but I just want to understand sort of the timing and mechanics as to how it's been collected, how it looks like for you guys specifically?
John Akers: Yes. From a technical basis, Julien, that is correct. We continue to follow that as well as other legislation across our entire system. So not going to try and predict or comment too much further on it than that at this point. If there are any questions or anything that comes up from the committees or those that are sponsoring that, obviously, we're standing by and prepared to answer that for them. But on a system-wide basis, on a legislative perspective, things have kind of been on a consistent theme, if you will, this year, that being damage prevention across all of our jurisdictions has been enhanced as well as some of our jurisdictions looking at energy efficiency programs at the state level as well. So we're very pleased with that. And additionally, I don't know if you've seen out there, but a couple more states have come on to approve all fuels or customer choice legislation, which provides about 24 states, I think, now across the country that has done that as well as, I think, 3 states right now have approved legislation for freedom to cook in their particular jurisdiction. So that's a quick recap across our territory on legislative action.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually since you bring it up, maybe I'd love to get your perspective on this. Colorado has had some discussions of late across both the PC and then also, in particular, the legislative side on I suppose, gas bills broadly. Any perspectives therein on where this could go? I mean, it seems a little bit -- it lacks specificity, shall we say.
John Akers: Well, no crystal ball here, Julien. I can tell you that for sure. But with that committee, with ongoing committees there in any legislature when we're asked, we'll certainly participate. We'll provide testimony, we'll provide feedback for our expert opinion. We're going to continue to watch that stay close to it, but also work with the PUC. If they come up with any questions, comments or open any dockets, we're certainly available to provide our feedback as well as our gas supply team that does a tremendous job each year in and out to make sure we get access to reliable supply for our customers.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just going back quickly, a little nuance. You alluded to it in your remarks. On O&M, I mean, seemingly holding the line fairly well here despite a consistently inflationary environment. Can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing out there? I mean, obviously, some of your peers had less success in managing their costs here. Can you comment a little bit about the clarity that you have and the line of sight here and just perhaps what that implies going forward as well?
Chris Forsythe: Sure, Julien. This is Chris. Working back closely with our operations team, just kind of looking really line by line opportunities where we could potentially defer items that are not compliance-related or safety related or with the system at risk. Similar to what we did there in the pandemic. A few levers there that we might be able to pull. Additionally, a lot just depends on timing of when contracts are executed in terms of locking in costs for a 12- to 18-month period, what we got in contracts kind of at the early part of our fiscal year. So at that point, we had locked in some contracts. We have a better line of sight, at least in terms of labor costs with respect to some of these third-party services which leads the variable -- just the number of locates, for example, that we might have to manage. And we did some sensitivity work around that. So those are just a couple of examples of how we're trying to look forward, manage your O&M within what we're capable of doing, while it can certainly providing a safe able service on the system.
John Akers: Yes. And I'll just close that, Julien. As Chris has said before and I've said before on these calls, we're not a just-in-time company when it comes to integrity work, O&M work, those safety-related items on our system. We like to stay well in advance of that, and that does provide some additional flexibility for us when we need it, certainly can speed things up or move things from one period to another. So that's an additional lever we have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30, 2023. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-02-08 07:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, February 08, 2023.  And I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Michell. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 24 and more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy today. I want to begin today's call by thanking everyone of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees across all of our eight states with their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions during winter storms Elliott and Mara. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continued modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2023 first quarter net income of $272 million or $1.91 per diluted share, and we reaffirmed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Our Atmos Pipeline, Texas division achieved several project milestones during the first quarter. Our APT team completed filling the Cushing gas requirements at the Bethel 1B cavern and working gas is currently being injected and debriding operations continue with a targeted completion date of April of this year. This third cavern provides additional support to APTs operations, as well as the local distribution companies behind APT systems and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. [Technical Difficulty] we completed the final portion of our 137 mile, 36 inch Line X integrity replacement project, as well as completed Phase 2 of our three phase line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. The second phase will place 17 miles of 14 inch pipeline with 36 inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. These projects enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued a 14 month streak of record employment in December and added 650,000 jobs for the 12 months ending December. This strong employment trend continues to drive the growth in our Mid Tex and West Texas divisions where approximately 47,000 of our nearly 64,000 new customers were added for the same 12 months ending December period. Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory remains strong. During the first quarter, we added 12 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 9 Bcf once they're fully operational. The largest of these new industrial customers is anticipated to use nearly 6 Bcf annually. Our procurement team continues to do an excellent job sourcing the materials needed to support our capital investment as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We also maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission needs. And as we said before, we have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for FY 2023. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistant agencies into our customers during the first quarter. Through their work, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers receive over $6 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, our energy assistance teams helped nearly 67,000 customers receive approximately 34 million of funding to help with their monthly bill. As you'll hear from Chris today, our fiscal 2023 financing costs are known. We have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond fiscal year 2023, and our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Atmos energy is well positioned to continue delivering safe, reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Chris for his update. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal ‘23 first quarter net income was $272 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Consolidated operating income increased to $321 million or 16% in the first quarter. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by system modernization spending, continued customer growth in our distribution segment, partial offset by higher O&M spending in both of our segments. Slide 5 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability spending totaled $79 million. Residential customer growth and increased industrial load increased operating income by an additional $5.5 million, and we saw a $5 million increase in APT’s [three] system business due to water spreads driven by maintenance and some of the key takeaway pipelines in the Permian during the quarter. Consolidated O&M expense increased $26 million, driven by planned higher in line inspection spending in APT, higher spending for third party damage prevention activities on our distribution system and increased employee and other administrative costs. Consolidated capital spending increased 16% to $111 million to $796 million with 88% dedicated to improve the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primary reflects higher spending at APT, the project that Kevin discussed just a few minutes ago. We continue to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $115 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we currently have about $36 million in progress. Slides 19 through 23 summarize those outcomes, and Slide 16 outlines our planned filings for the reminder of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we completed over $1 billion of long term debt and equity financing, highlighted by the $800 million long term debt financing we completed in October 2022 and $200 million of settled equity forward agreements. As of December 31st, we have approximately $755 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales arrangements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs.  Finally to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long term debt financing needs beyond fiscal '23, we currently have about $1.35 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively set a portion of treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.8% to 2.2%. All of this gives us a clear line of sight into our anticipated financing costs of fiscal '23 and a portion of our costs beyond fiscal '23 Our equity capitalization as of December 31st, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing was 60%. Additionally, we finished the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of liquidity. Additional details for financing activities as well as our financial profile can be found on Slides 7 through 10. Turning now to securitization. In Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority and the Bond Review Board continue to work diligently to determine the best outcome for customers with respect to securitization. Additionally, in January, the Texas legislature signaled intent to provide funding to gas and other costs incurred during winter storm Uri that were deemed prudently incurred by the Texas Railroad Commission in November 2021. We are encouraged with these developments and continue to support their efforts. However, we do not anticipate receiving securitization funds for interim winter storm financing matures on March 9th. We currently anticipate refinancing this debt through a combination of the syndicated bank term loan and utilization of our existing credit facilities and cash to minimize the cost of the customer while providing maximum flexibility to repay this debt once the securitization process is completed. Additionally, pursuant to an order issued by the Railroad Commission, we have deferred all carrying costs associated with the interim refinancing effective September 1st, and currently intend to defer carrying costs associated with the existing financing and new interim financing until the securitization process is complete. In Kansas, we received our financing order from the Kansas Corporation Commission in October 2022, and we are progressing well to securitize the approximately $90 million in gas and other costs incurred during winter storm Uri. We anticipate completing the securitization process this fiscal year. In closing, we are off to a good start to the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans in the first fiscal quarter positions us well to achieve our fiscal '23 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Details surrounding our fiscal '23 guidance can be found on Slides 12 and 13. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open up the call for questions. Michelle?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse.
Nick Campanella: I just wanted to ask on just the recent move in gas prices. Can you kind of just talk about how that's affecting your financial plan or your hedging strategies at all here? Clearly, it should help with bill headroom as well. But maybe you can just give us some more color on what the recent move means?
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start a little bit on the supply side and then let Chris pick up on the hedging side, Nick. Yes, we continue to see still good strong rate number [Technical Difficulty] $2 range in Waha and below $2 at Katy. So the forward look, particularly even out of the Waha area and the [indiscernible] area being in the $2 to $3 handle certainly look good on a go forward basis. As you've heard us say before, our storage positions helped us with some of that hedge early on. I think we were all in storage at an average weight cost of $5.48. So I think we're well positioned for the remainder of this year. The forward curves continue to look good at this point as we move into the summer and fall of next year. And the supply continues to look good out there from the major producing basin. So Chris, anything else to add?
Chris Forsythe: Just a couple of things, Nick. First off from a financing perspective, the $800 million long erm debt that we issued in October satisfies our anticipated long term debt financing needs. And as I've also already mentioned equity we got that priced for the remainder of the fiscal year. And you understand the math on the equity given where we are and in terms of what our financing needs over the next five years. Additionally, we do have full access to our credit facilities today, the operating credit facility, which supports our commercial paper program, a $1.5 billion program. We had no short term debt as of December 31st, so we had the ample liquidity there to support operations as well as gas supply. And then finally, just commenting on hedging to kind of follow from Kevin's point, our gas supply team kind of sets that hedging program in advance of the winter heating season. And between the combination of storage that Kevin alluded to, in the hedging programs, we had just under 50% of the cost locked in for this winter heating season. So to the extent that gas prices moderate for the other, say 50% or so, that should have a positive impact on the customer bill.
Nick Campanella: And Chris, I know that you're already fully priced on '23 kind of equity needs here. How should we kind of think about '24 and being opportunistic about further derisking the financial plan?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, of the $755 million, as I mentioned, Nick, that satisfies all of our needs and a substantial portion of our needs -- all of our needs for '23 and a substantial portion of our needs for fiscal '24. So the ATM program continues to work very well for us. We'll continue to utilize that to kind of just layer in additional pricing, if you will, on the equity needs for '24 with an eye towards just being opportunistic on pricing.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: Could you comment on the investigation by the Railroad Commission into the -- some of the service challenges that your system experienced during the winter weather in December? And just any initiatives or actions that you're pursuing on the back of that experience?
Kevin Akers: As you know, our team worked very hard going into this winter storm have prepared themselves, have prepared the system. But as the storm moved in we did have approximately 2,300 customers in a limited area of our service territory that experienced some service interruptions out of the 2.1 million, 2.2 million residential and commercial customers that we serve here in Texas. We have been working with the commission to provide them additional information and work with them as they wrap up their investigation, which we hope will occur here very soon.
David Arcaro: And then I was wondering, could you elaborate a bit just on the plans for refinancing some of the floating rate notes that are coming due related to winter storm Uri costs? And just is there an EPS impact that you might anticipate from having to refinance those just sort of waiting for the securitization process to get completed here?
Chris Forsythe: The short answer is no. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've got planned hybrid securitization that will be -- a term loan, a syndicated term loan that we anticipate executing here in the next few weeks as well as utilizing some of our credit facilities and cash. And with the regulatory asset order that the rail commission has granted, we are deferring all of those financing costs right now into that regulatory asset until securitization is complete. And then we'll address that with the commission the appropriate recovery of those costs.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gabe Moreen of Mizuho Securities.
Gabe Moreen: Maybe you can just talk to us about, broadly speaking, how O&M is tracking relative to your expectations so far this year. Are you seeing any let up in pressures? I'm just curious on that, your thoughts there.
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then Chris can jump in. As you heard in Chris' remarks, most of the O&M that we've experienced in the first quarter is what we thought we would see. It's in the range that we've already laid out there. And what I mean by that is that with the growth that we talked about, we certainly -- both on our side and in our jurisdictions have driven increased from a line locating perspective. That economic growth certainly drove new routes, new commercial businesses, new roads, new infrastructure, which drives up locating expenses. As a matter of fact, our Texas number of load case is up almost 10% this quarter-over-quarter last year. And then in addition, as you heard on some of the projects that I mentioned, we had some additional in line inspection work that we needed to pull forward on the APT side and some additional pigging activity that we slowed during the COVID period, but wanted to pick that work back up. So all things we anticipated kind of occurring during the quarter but saw a lot more line locating expense just given the growth that we're experiencing. Chris, anything additional?
Chris Forsythe: I think that's spot on, Kevin. And I would just to add that from an inflation perspective, the inflation we're experiencing that we're seeing, it's still well within the planning parameters that we outlined in our fiscal '23 guidance and our five year plan on an overall basis.
Gabe Moreen: And maybe if I could just follow up with sort of -- and apologies if I missed it, but you got a couple large projects that have either wrapped up or nearing completion. Can you maybe just talk about kind of what's next in the queue from a larger project standpoint as you look at across your system?
Kevin Akers: Well, those projects that I mentioned, Line X was an integrity project, which fortifies that line that comes out of Waha and runs west to east into Dallas and then the S2 is another integrity and capacity project to bring in additional supply from the east. So we'll continue to monitor our system, continue to monitor that growth. We still have, as I mentioned, complete that -- or the Bethel cavern 1B project, that will take us probably into 2026 to get all three caverns back in service at the same time. And just as a reminder, that's not only a capacity and need for the growth behind our systems, it's also an integrity project per rules at the commission where we have to do our integrity work on those caverns over 15 years. So we'll continue to look at our storage. We'll continue to look at the larger pipe infrastructure and see where that may need increasing or fortification as we move forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.
Richard Sunderland: I just wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion around the gas price dynamics. Curious for your thoughts on the duration of Waha weakness. We see a probability that in Waha gas prices remain depressed until Matterhorn enter service in mid-'24. Any thoughts around the duration here and impact to customer bills relative to your outlook last quarter?
Kevin Akers: Again, our team continues to stay close with the producers out there, midstream processors to keep it handle on, as you said, as well as new projects that are coming online. But I think the other thing that we'll continue to work on is the tie-in to some of those lines, that's the other opportunity, I think, for us as those projects continue to build coming out of Waha and head east that gives us an opportunity to get additional tests or to bring in additional supply into our areas as well. So all good signs, as you say, on the forward look. Right now, we believe these prices and the conversations we're holding, numbers look really good as you head into [Novi] March upcoming. So right now, I don't see things changing in the short run, at least the information we're getting out there. And then as we continue through this winter period, pulling on storage and get ready to inject for next season, the pricing looks really good there. As I said before, some in the $2 range or so. So that should have a very positive impact for our bills for next year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Ryan Levine at Citigroup.
Ryan Levine: Most of my questions were asked already, but I just want to follow up on one. In terms of the Mid Tex DAR proceeding. Can you provide an update around that regulatory activity?
Chris Forsythe: So we made that filing, the DAR filing in mid-January. We're just now beginning to work through the early discovery process, and we anticipate implementing new rates under the DAR filing by the end of the fiscal year.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. So I will turn the conference back to Dan Meziere for any closing remarks.
Dan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our Web site through March 31, 2023. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the ATO Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. You may begin. 
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 39 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin. 
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you joined us this morning. As tomorrow's Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and to say thank you to those who served in our own forces and approximately to the 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates as part of the nearly 20 million Americans who have bravely served our country. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.60, which represents the 20th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal 2022 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal 2023. Our success in fiscal 2022 was once again reflected by the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees. I've said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Fiscal 2022 was our 11th year of executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Over that 11-year period, we invested over $15 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 6,300 miles of distribution pipeline, approximately 440,000 steel service lines and over 1,200 miles of transmission pipeline. That same 11-year period, we added nearly 400,000 customers, including over 62,000 customers during fiscal 2022. And we continue to see strong natural gas demand from new and expanding industrial customers. In fiscal 2022, we added approximately 50 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 20 Bcf per year once they are fully operational. Over the last three years, we have added nearly 120 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 35 Bcf. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals, automotive and distilleries. Our fiscal 2022 capital investment of over $2.4 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of 715 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 47,000 service lines, of which 24,000 were steel service lines and over 155 miles of transmission pipe, all to further enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed over 200,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have over two million such devices across our system. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus, dedication and continued outstanding efforts to have the necessary materials and resources available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they had done throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal 2023. For example, we currently maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission operations needs and have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for fiscal year 2023. We continue to coordinate with our vendors and pipe mills as we place our FY 2024 steel pipe orders. Now, I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline-Texas projects and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that they provide APT and its customers. We are nearing the completion of APT's third salt dump cavern project at Bethel, which will provide more than 6 Bcf of additional working gas storage capacity. We began selling the new cavern this week and remain on track to place the cavern in service by the end of the calendar year. We are also nearing completion of the second phase of our Line X integrity replacement project, which we will replace 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This project is also on track to be completed by the end of this calendar year. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas, and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. We continue to make good progress with our line S-2 project that has three phases. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase one of the project replaced 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline and was placed into service the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, we'll replace 17 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We expect this to be in service late calendar this year. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. And again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east and bring that gas into the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin and Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be placed into service during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians provide exceptional customer service and support. During fiscal year 2022, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital build delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 50% of our customers are receiving electronic bills while the utility industry average is 33%. And 81% of the total payments we received as of September 30 this year were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking. During fiscal 2022, we provided approximately 260,000 hours of training. And in September, we reached a milestone of delivering 2 million training hours since the opening of our Charles K. Vaughan training center in 2010. In fiscal 2022, we continued enhancing our comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the five key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. Our efforts in fiscal 2022 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included our ongoing distribution and transmission system modernization programs that I mentioned earlier. And at our 5 APT storage fields, we completed the installation of gas cloud imaging technology. These 360-degree fixed-based cameras will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. And if necessary, the technology will send alerts, including images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we continued our installation of advanced wellhead leak detection at our distribution storage facilities. And we expanded our system monitoring technologies by adding additional advanced mobile leak detection vehicles as well as implemented technology to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities. From a fleet and facilities perspective, we began transitioning our fleet to gasoline hybrid light-duty vehicles and to CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, we are adding CNG refueling stations at our Fort-Worth and Round Rock facilities, both of which are scheduled for completion by end of this calendar year. At our corporate data center, we installed a natural gas-powered fuel cell to generate high efficiency, grid-independent electricity with low emissions. The fuel cells reduced our emissions at the data center by 27%. This is truly another example of how natural gas plays a pivotal role in lowering greenhouse gas emissions while increasing reliability to our critical facility. We have 2 new service centers that are pending leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED certification. If certified as expected, this will be the total number of LEED-certified facilities we have to 17 or approximately 11% of our total facilities. We are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year of RNG across our system for end-use customers, and we are evaluating over 30 opportunities that could further expand the amount of RNG that we are transporting today. Finally, we are partnering with local habitat for humanity organizations in each of our eight states to provide families with zero net energy homes. These homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials to produce more energy than they consume. During fiscal 2022, we completed five new zero net energy homes in Texas and one home in Ansbro, Kentucky, and we are scheduled to complete a home in Jackson, Mississippi, this December. We recently broke ground on a home in Dublin, Virginia and expect to complete construction in the spring of 2023. The seven ZNE Homes that we have completed in the last 14 months demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner. To wrap up fiscal 2022, our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our health care workers and first responders by supporting more than 140 nonprofits, dedicated to taking care of our hometown heroes, supplying them with meals and needed supplies. We planted trees and worked in our community gardens. Our team hosted utility fairs and energy assistant blitzes to support our share of the [Indiscernible] program for over 11,000 customers and donated $7 million of financial support. And for local -- and for 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources [Indiscernible] provided translated into nearly 9 million meals for our neighbors in need across our 1,400 communities. I am very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal 2022 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal 2022 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2023 guidance and updated five-year plan through fiscal 2027. I will then return with some closing comments. Chris, over to you.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share was $5.60, which represents a 9.4% increase over fiscal 2021. Our performance reflects the continued execution of our proven strategy of modernizing natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, recovering our cost timely and financing our operations in a balanced manner. We also continue to experience strong customer growth, and we saw a significant improvement in our bad debt expense, both of which offset lower customer consumption and increased O&M spending. Slides four through six provide some details summarizing our financial performance for the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income increased $220 million from rate adjustments implemented in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These adjustments were primarily driven by safety liability and system expansion spending. Approximately 68% of this increase is recognized in our distribution segment. We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $15 million. This growth offset a $17 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during the second fiscal quarter. Additionally, we experienced a $31 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $56 million, primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities in both of our segments and employee-related costs compared with the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a $25 million decrease in bad debt expense as we were able to perform collection activities for our full fiscal year. In comparison, in the prior year, we resumed collection activities late in our third fiscal quarter. This decrease also reflects the exceptional work of our customer service team in assisting customers with their bills. During fiscal 2022, we arranged only $34 million of funding to help 67,000 customers with their monthly bill. As a result, our bad debt expense in fiscal 2022 was in line with our pre-pandemic experience. Finally, reductions in fiscal 2022 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by approximately $112 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense. Consolidated capital spending increased 24% or $475 million to $2.4 billion, with 88% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects the increased system modernization, integrity and expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. Approximately 90% of this spending began to earn a return within six months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $216 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. And since the end of the fiscal year, we have reached agreement with our regulators in an additional $112 million in annualized operating income increases during our fiscal 2023 first quarter. As of today, we have two filings pending exceeding about $16 million. Slides 29 through 38 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal 2022 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. As of September 30, we had about $777 million available under existing equity forward arrangements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal 2023 needs and a portion of our anticipated fiscal 2024 needs. This equity financing complemented the $800 million of long-term debt financing we issued during fiscal 2022. We also continue to make progress in securitization. In Texas, we anticipate receiving $2.0 billion from the Texas public financing authorities within the next few months. We'll use the proceeds and available cash on hand to fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim winter storm financing that matures in March of 2023. This will eliminate all of our exposure to floating rate debt. In Kansas, on October 25, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued a financing order authorizing us to securitize $118 million in gas and over cost over a seven to 10-year period. We anticipate completing the securitization process by the end of our second fiscal quarter. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization at the end of fiscal year, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing or 61.3%. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity. In October, we issued $800 million of long-term debt through two tranches. First tranche was a $500 million 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5. 75%. We had financially hedges tranced and received $197 million upon settlement of forward starting interest rate swap, which reduced the effective rate of 4.5%. Second tranche was a $300 million 10-year senior note with a coupon of 5.5% because we have already satisfied our fiscal 2023 equity needs through our ATM program, this transaction and completed our anticipated fiscal 2023 financing activities. Details for our financing activities and our financial profile can found on slides nine and 12. Finally, we finished the fiscal year with a very well-funded pension plan. Based on the current funded position of the plan and the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we do not anticipate the need to make a minimum required contribution during fiscal 2023. In addition to addressing our fiscal 2023 financing needs, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we've also been preparing to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers for the upcoming winter heating season. Our gas supply team has done an outstanding job preparing for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary and contracted storage is over 96% full. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged 23% of our expected winter purchase requirements. Through the use of storage and physical and financial hedges, we have stabilized prices for just under half for our normal winter usage in the mid-$5 range. The remainder of our anticipated gas supply needs will be satisfied through a combination of base load purchases at first-of-month prices, peaking contracts and storage purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity of 38 pipelines across our eight-state footprint, which provides our team access to a wide variety of liquid-traded producing basins. Further, a significant portion of our gas supply needs will continue to be sourced from Waha, which has traditionally traded below NYMEX and Henry Hub pricing. As a reminder, all prudently incurred gas costs recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months. This calculation generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps to smoothly impact on customer bills. Additionally, as a reminder, we have the opportunity to recover the gas cost portion of bad debt expense through a purchase guidance cost mechanisms in five states, which covers approximately 81% of our distribution customer base. Finally, we continue to actively communicate with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices through energy conservations and how we can help by offering installment plans and budget billing plans and locating energy assistant agencies. Looking forward, yesterday, we initiated our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about two-thirds of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on slides 20 and 21. Fiscal 2023 capital spending is expected to approximate $2.7 billion. Already 5% of this spending is expected to begin earning a return within six months of the test period end. Substantially, all this increase we incurred in our distribution segment to support our system modernization efforts. Spending on our pipeline storage segment is expected to be in line with fiscal 2022 levels and is expected to represent approximately one-third for consolidated capital spending in fiscal 2023. And yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 156th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2023 is $2.96, an 8.8% increase over fiscal 2022. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our fiscal 2023 five-year plan. In short, these themes are very consistent with what we have been presenting over the last several five-year plans. Over the next five years, we anticipate earnings will grow annually at 6% to 8%. By fiscal 2027, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $8.05. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization and expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share from fiscal 2027. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $15 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which translates into an estimated rate base of approximately $25 billion in fiscal 2027, up from $14 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. From an O&M perspective, we will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate O&M to range from $700 million to $720 million, and we've assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal 2027 off of FY 2022 levels. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $435 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next five years. We anticipate about 65% of this amount will be refunded during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. As a result, we expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2023 to range between 10% and 12%. We've also planned for becoming a material cash taxpayer in the back half of the five-year plan because of the 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed this past August. We've continued to finance our operations in a balanced fashion using a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next five years. As I mentioned earlier, we've already satisfied $1.5 billion of this anticipated need. Strength for our balance sheet enables us to use that prove the mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2027. To mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long-term debt financing needs beyond fiscal 2023, we currently have about $1.35 billion before starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%. Additionally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, once we repay the interim winter storm financing, we will have no floating rate debt, which further mitigates interest rate risk. See slide 12 for details. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 18 years and a weighted average cost of debt of about 3.78%, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental financing related to Winter Storm Uri, and no material refinancing needs until fiscal 2027. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program is a preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2022 has fully satisfied our anticipated fiscal 2023 equity needs and a portion of our fiscal 2024 meetings. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2027. And as you can see on slides 25 through 27, the execution of this plan will also keep our customer bills very competitive from a cost perspective compared with other common utility bills in the customer household. Thank you for the time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you heard this morning, we have taken several steps to mitigate execution risk in fiscal 2023. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our procurement team has done an excellent job of sourcing the materials needed to support our capital spending program in fiscal 2023. Our gas supply team has us well positioned for the upcoming heating season. And as Chris noted, our fiscal year 2023 financing costs are known, and we have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond FY 2023. I'm very excited about our direction and long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety-driven accompanied with organic growth that yield 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share. Commensurate dividend per share growth supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of our natural gas investment and natural gas infrastructure. 98% of our rate base is situated in six or eight states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. We have constructive regulatory mechanisms that support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $15 billion in capital spending over the next five years. And as you can see on slide 16 and 17, this spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 120,000 and 170,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy and is reflected in the vital role we play in every community. That is delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Sunderland: Hi good morning and thank you for the time today. Starting on the O&M side, your 2023 guidance implies a higher step-up relative to the 3% and 3.5% target. What are the drivers of the higher near-term O&M inflation? And then maybe more broadly, how do you think about O&M as a lever to manage customer bill impact overall?
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. As we've moved out of the pandemic and moving forward, we continue to work with our vendors, our contractors. We've got long-term contracts in place. Some of those have been updated to reflect inflationary costs here recently. All of those are included in the numbers that we've laid out in the 2023 and the five-year plan there. Additionally, such things as line locating, leak survey, we've incurred some additional costs there. But again, all within the parameters laid out there, and we think we have ourselves well positioned to have an understanding of those costs as we continue to move forward. And as far as levers going forward, we have the same opportunity for levers that we had as we were in the pandemic. It's been like travel, even though we're back and trying to find our new normal on a day-to-day basis here, we're not fully traveling to all events or activities that we did pre-pandemic, taking advantage of the technology such as Teams or Zoom meetings, those sort of things that are out there. And some of the things that Chris outlined in our strategy, financing strategy and some of the outcomes there are all things that fold into reducing that O&M as well and trying to keep cost tamping down on a going-forward basis. So Chris, any additional thoughts? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. The only other thing that Kevin, I would add is, and Rich, you've heard us talk about this before the last couple of years in terms of levers. We are -- a lot of this O&M spending or virtually all of it is focused on safety, maintenance and compliance. And so we have the opportunity to continue to expand those types of activities. There is a little bit of inflation in the numbers, as Kevin alluded to, but we are not a just-in-time safety or compliance company. So, we're looking forward in 2023 to kind of staying ahead of the curve, if you will, on those type of activities. So if there is, in fact, a need to pull in a lever, as Kevin alluded to, again, we have that opportunity. So that's really what's driving it. There is really no -- anything new or different in the underlying activities. We're just seeing higher activities across the entire system, as Kevin mentioned. Line locating, we continue to do, enhanced leak survey activities, but we're also seeing a little bit of cost increases through inflation as well.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. That's very helpful color. And just a quick follow-up on that front. So I understand your point about some of these vendor contracts rolling in at higher inflationary costs, is this a trend you expect to continue into 2024? How do you see that kind of moderating over time to get back to the 3% to 3.5% outlook? 
Kevin Akers: Yes, we continue to have conversations with our contractors and service providers as well. Right now, I think we're well positioned. I don't want to try and peer into a crystal ball to see what's out there. But again, we're very comfortable with what we have into our plan. As it sits today, the conversations we're having with our contractors, vendors, suppliers on cost as they see them going forward and that we've accurately captured those at this point.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. That makes sense. And just quickly switching gears, several months until Texas securitization proceeds, if I heard you correctly in the script, just any color on the process from who you are and what you're watching for on this front? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, Richard, we're obviously in close contact with the Texas financing authority. There's a lot of questions that we and all the participating utilities are having and the process is moving along as quickly as they can. And I said within the next few months -- so we were hoping before the end of the calendar year to potentially slip into early 2023. But again, we're working diligently alongside our other participating utilities and the TPFA to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible.
Richard Sunderland: Understood. Thank you for the time today.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
Gabe Moreen: Hey good morning everyone. I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on sort of the customer growth outlook going forward here, whether you've seen any signs of changes given, I guess, the slowdown in the housing market? And whether you think you're going to be in that 1.5% to 2% annual range from a customer growth standpoint?
Kevin Akers: Thank you. Obviously, the existing housing market with the increased interest rates, we see some slowdown across our service territory for that. But the new home market, according to our builders, our developers, our folks on the ground across our service territories and the feedback we're getting has been less of an impact, if you will, than the existing home market. Even though we anticipate some decrease as we head into the first part of the year, some of that giving just a winter time period itself, some of that being an impact from the inflation. But what we're being told is there is a significant backlog of homes under construction today with approved buyers that have already locked in interest rates out there. And just to give you some example here, according to Texas Workforce Commission, just a couple of months ago, some of the data they're putting out, the Metroplex in particular, is experiencing pre-pandemic job growth with new hires exceeding 100,000 annually. The Austin area as well is seeing about 40,000 annual job growth. Unemployment in our service territories continues to remain low. And again, our builders and developers have a backlog of folks wanting qualified and ready to purchase homes. So good news to hear that our service territory, even with the inflationary environment we're currently in, continue to see strong job growth, strong economic growth. And our builders and developers are able to keep up with that demand. 
Gabe Moreen: Great. And then speaking of interest rates and kind of locking them in, kudos for locking in interest rates for some time on new instruments. I'm just curious in the current interest rate environment, whether you're going to continue to lock in interest rates in anticipation of debt issuance down the line? And then I guess a related question to the minimum book tax. You talked about that potentially hitting kind of towards the end of the five-year plan. Does that change at all the financing plans given the interest expense is tax deductible, would you shift a little bit more? Or to try to, I guess, minimize cash taxes, appreciating that, that's not for several years? 
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. Yes. Gabe, all the credit goes to -- Dan is here, his treasury team for locking in those rates, and we had the opportunity. We continue to look for opportunities to hedge interest rates. Obviously, in a rising price environment right now -- or rate environment, excuse me, it's challenging, but it's something that we will continue to look at, certainly month in and month out, as we continue to watch where the Fed is going with rate increases. With respect to the corporate minimum tax that cash need and therefore, the related financing is already assumed in the current five-year plan. We're expecting that tax to hit sometime in the next four to five years. The size of the impact is still a little bit TBD as we look at where the final rules around depreciation, how repairs are handled, that type of thing. But we have made some assumptions in that plan and it's reflected in our financing needs. 
Gabe Moreen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
David Arcaro: Hey good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the customer bill outlook here? And whether you think there could be any increased pressure to manage rate increases going forward? Are there steps that you're looking at to take just to manage that outlook? 
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start. Again, it all begins first with our gas supply team and their ability to go out and get reliable, securable supply. And I think, Dan, for us, if you look at the major components of the bill, that's the commodity portion. You look at what's driving that upstream today. You're currently just short of 800 total rigs working in the U.S. today, about half of that over in the Permian. You look at where we sit today at Waha, it's $2 and some change. Right now, the forward look on that April out is in the $2 range. Even on the NYMEX, you look forward, there's a four handle out there. So all to say, I think the outlook in current conditions as we kind of work ourselves through this heating season forward. looks good for the commodity price to mitigate some as well on the customer bill. The other thing that I think is important for us to think about when it comes to affordability out there are the actions that our team, our public affairs team and our local corporate communications team do day in and day out at the state level and the federal level, advocating for light heat [ph] funding and state funding for energy assistance agencies out there. And just to give you an example, this year, our team was able to help almost 70,000 customers gain access to $34 million. So there's a lot of components that go into it. It's being able to secure reliable gas at a reasonable price. It's the ability to get customers the help when they need it. It's also the messaging to customers about what we're seeing. We released now three communications to our customers advising them of ways they can conserve on their energy bill as well. 
David Arcaro: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then wondering if you could comment on the NTSB report that was published last month related to the gas incident from a year ago? And just what initiatives are being undertaken internally in response to that? 
Kevin Akers: Yes, we'll let the NTSB report standby itself. We're not going to comment on the NTSB report. We are a party to the investigation. We work closely with them and other parties to the investigation. I'll point you to our operational and report as well that's filed with NTSB, it outlines all of our safety initiatives, findings as well. 
David Arcaro: Okay, got it. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up on the tax side of things. Is there a cash tax level that you're expecting in the near term or for 2023 just as kind of a starting point as to what cash tax rate you're experiencing under the current business? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, in fiscal 2022, we were, I've got to say, a very minimal cash taxpayer, both from a federal and state perspective, very low double digits. We anticipate that to be similar for fiscal 2023 through 2025. And I said 2026, 2027, that's when we expect in that four to five-year period when the ANT [ph] will kick in. 
David Arcaro: Perfect. Okay, thanks so much.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you for the time. Hope you guys are well? Just if I could go back to where Rich started at the top of the Q&A here. If I recall back last quarter, you guys said several months on the tax securitization issue. Can you talk about the -- just what that delay has been? And ultimately, what hoops need to be crossed here in terms of bringing this to finality? I get that there's probably a lot of administrative considerations, a lot of coordination with the state here. But just in terms of practically bringing this securitization to a close on the $2.2 billion, how do you think about what's driven a little bit of this delay ultimately? And your level of confidence that you'll be able to get this thing resolved ahead of the March timeline, which admittedly is well in excess of the next several months.
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. Again, we have great confidence in the process that the legislature laid out that the Railroad Commission has approved and that the TPFA is going through now. Our role now is just supporting with questions -- answers to questions that the groups have. We're not sitting at the table or anything like that. We are just responding to Q&A or information request that sort of thing at this point. So again, we remain very confident in the process and the ability of the teams to get the answers they need to move forward. So, Chris, anything additional?
Christopher Forsythe: I think it's pretty well said, Kevin. And just as a reminder, too, a securitization of this nature, I think, is new for the state. And so they're just making sure all the and -- all the Is are dotted and all the Ts are crossed.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Right. So it's truly sort of administrative in execution in terms of the shift in time line? It seems like it and driven by the state more than you guys? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, absolutely.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then if I can go back to the conversation on O&M as well. Obviously, pressure across the industry, you guys highlighting it in your 2023 numbers. If I can overlay that with the regulatory strategy as it exists today. I mean, as you think about your ability to earn your returns and just accelerate time lines on any kind of regulatory proceedings here, is that shifting anything at all? Obviously, you have a plethora of associated mechanisms across your portfolio of utilities. But can you speak a little bit to the extent to which this is shifting and/or accelerating some time line for recovery? Again, obviously, this in tandem with your elevated level of spending. I'm just curious if you can comment on that.
Kevin Akers: Yes. Again, Julien, I'll start, and Chris can add any comments. If you look at our mechanisms, most of our mechanisms are annual in nature. So they're on prescribed time lines, filing dates, orders on the back end of those sort of things. Those are prescribed. We're going to continue to follow those. Our projects are well laid out as you've seen. You hope for a long time now and how we like to go through planning our fiscal year and then the subsequent four years after that to get to our five-year plans. The only thing that's moving forward or backward is our safety and reliability investments depending on what we see from a need, a growth need, a compliance need, a safety need, those sort of things are levers for us to move things forward or backward to meet the growing demand on our customer system or safety on our system. 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, and the one thing, Julien, I want to add to that, too, is that with our -- the regulatory strategy, the annual mechanisms, it's a smaller increase, if you will, each year. It also gives us the opportunity to stay in regular contact with our regulatory partners to -- so they understand what we're doing from a total spend perspective. And that's a part of the strategy as well is keeping them well informed of what's going on in our operations, what we're seeing from a safety, maintenance, compliance perspective so that when we do have the other filing in front of them, they're aware of what's included in that filing. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate it.
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Dan Meziere for closing comments. 
Daniel Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through December 31st, 2022. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Brock. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings call.  With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.  Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 33 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.  With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior VP and CFO. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.  Fiscal '22 third quarter net income increased $129 million or $0.92 per diluted share -- $102 million, sorry, $0.78 per diluted share in the prior year quarter and fiscal year-to-date net income was $703 million or $5.12 per diluted share compared with net income of $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Slides 5 and 6 provide operating income highlights for each of our segments for the 3 and 9 months ended June 30. I will focus on some of the more significant drivers underlying our fiscal year-to-date performance.  Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $172 million, primarily driven by increased safety and reliability spending and system expansion. Approximately 71% of these rate adjustments were recognized in our distribution segment.  We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $13 million. This growth offset a $13 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during assessed in the second fiscal quarter. We did not see the same trend continuing in the third fiscal quarter as consumption increased by about $3 million quarter-over-quarter.  Additionally, we experienced a $25 million increase in consolidated O&M expense primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities and employee-related costs compared with the prior year, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.  Finally, reductions in fiscal '22 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by $103 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense.  Consolidated capital spending increased 27% or $368 million to $1.7 billion, with 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. On the regulatory front, we have completed approximately $216 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. Of this amount, we have implemented $202 million, and we implemented the remainder on September 1.  Additionally, we had about $127 million in progress. Slides 15 through 32 provide additional detail around the regulatory activities. Our fiscal third quarter financing activities were focused on pricing our fiscal '23 equity needs.  During the quarter, we executed 4 sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 2.9 million shares for $337 million. And we sold agreements on 731,000 shares for approximately $81 million in net proceeds.  As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreement, which satisfies substantially all of our anticipated equity needs through fiscal '23. We finished the third quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.7%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and with total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion.  Additional details for our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile on Slides 8 through 11. Turning now to securitization. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on that front.  In Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we believe it is on track to be completed within the next few months. As a reminder, once we receive the securitization funds, we will fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim Winter Storm financing.  In Kansas, during the third quarter, we filed our application for a financing order. Based on the approved procedural schedule, we anticipate receiving the financing order during our fiscal '23 first quarter.  In closing, our fiscal year-to-date performance was in line with our expectations and supports the reaffirmation of our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share.  Slides 13 and 14 provide additional details around our guidance. The ranges included in those pages have not changed since the last quarter. However, we do anticipate our O&M interest expense to be at the higher end of the ranges provided.  Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?
John Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fiscal year-to-date results, Chris just shared reflect the continued focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.  And supporting that vision of our 4,700 dedicated employees executing our safety and reliability investment strategy and our prudent regulatory and financing strategies. These strategies, combined with a strong portfolio of assets will continue to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026.  We continue to see robust growth in demand for natural gas in our service territories. During the 12-month period ended June 30, 2022, we added nearly 59,000 new residential customers which represents a 1.8% increase. And during the third quarter of this year, we added 13 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 5 Bcf when they are fully operational.  Fiscal year-to-date, we have added 28 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 10 Bcf when they are fully operational. As you heard me say before, on a volumetric basis, that 10 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding 170,000 residential customers.  Last month, we released our most recent corporate responsibility and sustainability report, which illustrates our environmental, social and governance strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers.  The report also summarizes the commitments as well as the progress made towards executing that strategy during fiscal 2021 and early fiscal 2022. I wanted to comment on one of the exciting highlights in the corporate responsibility report. That is our Zero Net Energy Homes initiative.  By partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organizations in each of our 8 states, we are providing families with Zero Net Energy Homes that use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than they consume over the course of the year all in a cost-effective manner.  Again, as you've heard us mention before, we've completed our first Zero Net Energy Home in Evans, Colorado in September of 2021. And during the third quarter of this year, we completed a second Zero Net Energy Home in Taylor, Texas located just north of Austin.  Construction is underway on 3 additional Zero Net Energy Homes in Dallas, one in Jackson, Mississippi, one in Owensboro, Kentucky, and all these are scheduled for completion by November of this year. Additionally, groundbreaking is scheduled later this calendar year for an additional 5 Zero Net Energy homes, one in Dublin, Virginia, one in Colombia, Tennessee and 3 in Lubbock, Texas.  These homes provide families with a comfortable natural gas home that demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner.  Our fiscal year performance and participation in community projects such as these as our Zero Net Energy homes, reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of our 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as they see a vital role in our 1,400 communities by safely delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.
Kody Clark: It's Kody Clark on for Julien. So first, wondering if you can walk us through the main drivers for the remainder of the year. It seems like you're well ahead based on year-to-date results, rate increases for the remainder of the year and your updated expectations on O&M and interest. I guess I'm just trying to get a better understanding of your expectations within that $550 million to $560 million range.
Christopher Forsythe: You muted there a little bit. But if I'm understanding correctly, you're looking for the main drivers for the remainder of the fiscal year to try to give you some color around where we might fall within the guidance range?
Kody Clark: That's right. I'm sorry about that. Hopefully, you can hear me better now.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, much better now. Thank you. Yes. I mean, you've touched on a couple of them. The main drivers again on the O&M front, we have some compliance work that we're doing some additional system integrity work.  The timing may shift between September or in October, just based on when the work is performed. We're also monitoring our bad debt expense levels. This is our kind of our big collection season, although the bad debt expense is down year-over-year.  Typically, the fourth quarter -- our fourth fiscal quarter is a time where we have increased collection activities, we're kind of monitoring that as well. And then finally, on the interest expense front, we do have the floating rate note as a component of the interim Winter Storm financing and prices have increased somewhat over the last fiscal year, which is driving our interest expense a little bit higher. And that could potentially tick up once the rates have reset later here in the fourth fiscal quarter.  So those are some of the things that we're monitoring in terms of the guidance range. I would say at this point, where we ended the fiscal quarter or on a year-to-date basis, we were in line with our expectations, and we stand behind the guidance that we put out today.
Kody Clark: Understood. Okay. And as we look toward FY '23, curious if you can opine on how you see inflation cascading through your O&M budget and capital plan.  What sort of trends are you expecting into next year? And any mitigating measures that you're thinking about?
John Akers: Yes. Kody, I'll start off, and then Chris can jump in there. As we've talked about before, a lot of our contracts that we have in place have been refreshed recently with our contractors and our vendors.  A lot of our large projects we do, whether they're on the med tech side or the APT side, our bid projects there. We feel good about how those have been coming in.  As Chris said, we continue to work on our integrity management and compliance projects. We think those are all in good standing. And on the procurement front, we -- as we talked about before, we try to run well ahead to make sure we have enough inventory on hand to complete and stay ahead of our compliance and pipeline replacement work.  Our team tries to keep about a 6-month inventory on hand and may even be looking to push that out towards the 9-month level. We have all the pipe either in the ground or on the ground to complete our 2022 projects.  We have the pipe in the works right now for '23 and are looking for material out into the '24 period. So as you can see, we're taking advantage when we can to make sure we've got the best pricing that our materials are available, and we can continue to move forward at the best and most efficient manner.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. And Kevin, I'll add to that. I mean you spot on with just the keeping up annually with the increases on the O&M front. But I'll also comment on the treasury side as well.  I mean our team has done an excellent job trying to get ahead of rising interest rates, with the exception of the interim Winter Storm financing, which we will take out once the securitization funds are received that we have no floating rate debt.  We have executed nearly $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps on future planned debt issuances beyond fiscal 2022 at very attractive rates, and we've done that here over the last year or so. And we're really well positioned.  When you look at our overall weighted average cost of debt today, it's at 3.8%, which is very beneficial for our customers. And finally, we don't have any significant near-term refinancing needs. Our most -- I guess the most current one that's out there right now is about $500 million due in 2027.  So from a balance sheet and financing perspective, we're also have taken advantage over the last year or so, we're trying to lock in some of the lower rates for the benefit of the customers, which also helps mitigate the impact on the customer bill.
John Akers: Yes. Kody, just to finish that off. And again, some of the same things, tools that we had in our toolkit, if you will, as we were entering and coming through the pandemic are still there for us.  We haven't started back a lot of travel. We're going to the most sense of urgency meetings, those sort of things still taking advantage of teams. So everything that we had in our toolkit during the pandemic, we continue to have today as well as I'll just again mention our ability to move projects forward and back because we are not a just-in-time compliance company. We try and run ahead of that. So that gives us some flexibility as well.
Operator: The next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs.
Insoo Kim: First question, Kevin, you were talking about the industrial customers and the additions this quarter and for the year. First, can you just give a little bit more color on the mix of the types of the industrial customers?  And from a pace perspective of these additions? Is this a little bit faster than what you had baked in? Just trying to get a sense of which industries are -- you're seeing most growth and what type of potential capital opportunities may exist in the future for you guys?
John Akers: Yes. Sure. Just before we get into that, again, our service story is extremely blessed. We have exceptional leadership at the city, the state level there, great chambers of commerce, great economic development partners in each of our states. And so we have a well-diversified industrial footprint out there.  For example, in a couple of our divisions, we've seen the addition of hydroponic greenhouse facilities, which are large consumers of natural gas. We've seen the location of the distilling industry, both new facilities and expansion of distilling facilities out there.  We've seen an EV battery manufacturing plant located on our facilities. We've seen concrete and asphalt facilities, expansions of colleges and universities. So as well as some metals, aluminum, steel, smaller plants and then expansions of some existing ones as well.  So as you can see there, it's a variety of everything across the board there, which is good for a local economy. And the thing that comes along with these expansions or new additions, as you know, is the jobs, the amount of jobs that this supports and brings in the community, which means rooftops and commercial load as well.
Insoo Kim: Got it. That's definitely good color. Second one, The Inflation Reduction Act, obviously, for the electric industry, a lot of initial thoughts there. Just for you, as it relates to that bill, just curious on your overall thoughts on what potential opportunities or challenges could exist.  For example, I'm thinking of the RNG side, obviously, you're not in the upstream side of things, but how does that fit takes place? How has that changed? Your thinking there and then just from a -- curious from a messing tax perspective, does that impact your pipeline business at all?
John Akers: Okay. Yes. There's a lot packed into that question. So let me first start with, we're still reviewing, going through all of the detail that's laid out in the bill.  And as you know, the bill still got a long way to go through the legislative process. And could be altered one way or the other as it makes its way through. But we're going to stay very close to the process and stay close to the details to see what potential upside exist for us out there.  However, I will say it is good to see Senator Manchin's comments that this bill is not arbitrarily shut off abundant fossil fuels, I think, is his quote. Then in a recent article I saw some time from last year, Senator Manchin indicated that natural gas must be included in any clean energy program.  So for me, it's good to see and hear that because it's going to take all forms of energy, right? A diversified energy portfolio, as we've been saying for a long time, including natural gas, our nearly 3 million miles of pipeline infrastructure in our underground storage fields, which we have about 120 Bcf here at Atmos Energy.  All that's going to be required to meet the growing demand going forward. And again, it's good to see that realization, the conversation at that level being taken place because a one-sized energy solution, I don't think provides the security viability and affordability that this country needs to meet the growing energy demand that's out there.  So we look forward to continuing to see how the bill evolves. We think we are a good operator, a prudent operator. As you've seen through our pipeline replacement projects, we tightened up our system, we've got a good environmental strategy out there. So I think we can operate in this legislation, but we're going to continue to monitor and see what the details show as this thing moves forward.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through September 30. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-05-05 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. 
 I will now turn the conference over to our host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin. 
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Diego. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. 
 As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 33 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior VP and CFO. Chris? 
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal '22 second quarter net income of $325 million or $2.37 per diluted share compared to $297 million or $2.30 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $574 million or $4.24 per diluted share compared with earnings of $514 million or $4.01 per diluted share in the prior year period.
 Consolidated operating income decreased to $661 million for the 6 months ended March 31. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and through the end of last fiscal year, we reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a 3- to 5-year period. These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate was recognized in the prior year when those agreements were completed. 
 In fiscal '22, the corresponding reduction in the effective tax rate was recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with [ the minimum ] periods. However, they will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. 
 Excluding the impact of these refunds, operating income for the 6 months ended March 31, increased $62 million or 9% to $743 million. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments, the 3 and 6 months ended March 31. 
 I will focus on some of the key drivers underlying our year-to-date performance. Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $120 million with approximately 77% coming from our distribution segment. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $11 million. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in consumption. Most of this decrease occurred during the second fiscal quarter will be observed that residential consumption on a per heating degree day basis was approximately 6% lower than the prior year quarter. We attribute this decrease primarily to customer conservation in response to the current inflationary environment, including the increased cost of natural gas included in customer bills. 
 As a reminder, our weather normalization mechanisms substantially offset changes in weather as measured on a heating degree day basis. However, they do not adjust for changes in customer behavior. Additionally, we experienced a $27 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. $20 million of this increase occurred during the first fiscal quarter as we performed more pipeline maintenance activities in this year's first fiscal quarter compared to prior year. 
 Consolidated capital spending increased 41% or $344 million to $1.2 billion, that's 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system while reducing methane emissions. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. 
 We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have completed $74 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. And we currently have about $270 million in progress. Slides 20 through 32 summarize those outcomes. And Slide 17 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
 During the second quarter, we completed our planned financing activities for fiscal '22. In January, we issued $200 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.625% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off our $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April. 
 Additionally, we fully priced our remaining equity needs for fiscal '22 and a significant portion of our fiscal '23 equity needs. During the second quarter, we executed forward sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 4.7 million shares for $500 million. And we settled forward agreements on 3.5 million shares for approximately $322 million in net proceeds. As of March 31, we have approximately $450 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. 
 Our second quarter activities exhausted a $1 billion ATM program we established in June of 2021, and we established a new $1 billion ATM program at the end of March. We finished the second quarter with an equity capitalization ratio of 61%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion. Additional details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 8 to 11. 
 During the second quarter, we continued to make progress in securitization. In March, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our gas and other related costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri with no disallowances. We plan to file our application for a financing order during our third fiscal quarter. And in Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we still anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. 
 I'll close my portion of our prepared remarks with a few comments on our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance, which we tightened to a range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share. Earnings for the first half of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations. With approximately 70% of our distribution revenues earned for the fiscal year and the fact we're heading into the summer months we believe any potential change in customer behavior in the second half of the fiscal year will not have a material impact on revenue. Additionally, customer growth for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were stronger than we had planned, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of the fiscal year. 
 In our Pipeline and Storage segment, our straight fixed variable rate design for substantially all of the segment's revenues drives clarity into the second half of the fiscal year. 
 Additionally, we were seeing spreads widen, which is expected to provide a modest increase in APT's through system revenue. Finally, we have completed our fiscal '22 financial -- financing program, including pricing all of our equity needs for the remainder of the fiscal year which removes one more variable. 
 Slides 13 through 14 provide additional details around our guidance. 
 Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin? 
John Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you heard, the first 6 months of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations, which leaves us well positioned for another successful fiscal year. This performance reflects a commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees, as we continue to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers across 1,400 communities in 8 states.
 During the first half of the fiscal year, we continue to experience strong customer growth, as you just heard from Chris. For example, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, we added over 57,000 new customers which represents a 1.8% increase. We added nearly 1,800 commercial customers during the first 6 months of this fiscal year. And we added 15 new industrial customers that we anticipate using nearly 5 Bcf of natural gas annually when at full capacity. 
 On a volumetric basis, that 5 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding nearly 85,000 residential customers to our system. We're very proud of our efforts for these new customers coming on our system. 
 As Chris mentioned, our capital spending has increased about $344 million over the prior year period, and we remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Through our system modernization efforts, we are on track to replace 800 to 1,000 miles of pipe and 20,000 to 30,000 steel service lines, all of which supports our goal of reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 from 2017 levels for EPA reported distribution and maintenance services. That also includes APT's integrity work on projects like our Line X Phase 2 replacement, which is under construction and includes 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline anticipated to be completed later this calendar year. As a reminder, we placed Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. That phase replaced 64 miles of 36-inch pipeline. 
 Additionally, construction has begun on Phase 2 of our Line S-2 replacement project. This 18-mile 36-inch project is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Again, as a reminder, we placed 22 miles of 36-inch completed in Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. 
 This modernization work is a significant component of our comprehensive environmental strategy that focuses on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. 
 During the second quarter, we added another RNG facility that will provide renewable natural gas for transportation across our system. That facility has the potential to flow up to 0.5 Bcf a year. As you know, we are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that could further expand these transportation opportunities. 
 As I mentioned on previous calls, we completed our first zero-net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. Zero Net Energy homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost, approximately $50 per month for the combined gas and electric bill for the Evans, Colorado home. We are now partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organization in each of our 8 states to construct additional zero-net energy homes. Currently, our home in Dallas is under construction. And on April 27, we held the dedication for our zero-net energy home in Taylor, Texas. 
 Additionally, in Jackson, Mississippi on April 28, Atmos Energy and Habitat for Humanity Capital earlier, held a groundbreaking ceremony for Mississippi's first zero net energy home. And in Lubbock, 3 homes are scheduled to begin construction in early September of this year. These zero net energy homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner, providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. 
 Our customer support organization and technology support team continue to innovate and look for ways to improve our customer service and offer convenient channels for our customers to communicate with us as well as to make payments. For example, over 31% of our customers are enrolled in recurring auto [ draft ], which is about 8% higher than industry average. 
 We also see continuous growth in our electronic bill delivery channels with nearly 50% of our customers enrolled in E-bill. We continue our outreach to customers to make them aware of our flexible planet fans as well as provide contact information for local, state and federal energy assistance programs. 
 For the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our customer support associates, our energy assistant specialist and coordinator through our customer advocacy team helped nearly 44,000 customers received $15 million in energy assistance. It is through heartfelt caring efforts like that, an exceptional customer service that provide the satisfaction ratings for these employees that exceed 97%. These activities and initiatives reflect how we are focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy as we serve a very vital role in every community by delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and into the future. 
 We believe our focus on long-term sustainability combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financial strategies continues to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026. 
 We appreciate your time and interest in Atmos Energy this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Crédit Suisse. 
Nicholas Campanella: So a lot of detail. Thanks for the update. Just on the financing side of things, your cost of equity has improved since the start of your fiscal year. And I know you're largely set on '22 equity needs now and you gave us a lot of detail around the forward program. But just any thoughts on why not do more now and take this off the table for kind of future years? And is it just that you guys are being just fairly formulaic? And how you execute here? And just any thoughts on out your equity? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. A couple of things there, Nick. First, we are under our ATM program for a number of quarters now, have been executing forward arrangements. So we may very well take advantage of the current pricing environment to establish pricing for our fiscal '23 and beyond. As I indicated, fiscal '22 is fully priced for the remainder of our fiscal year. 
 So that's an opportunity that we'll take a look at here in the third and the fourth quarter to take advantage of the pricing -- the current pricing environment to build on what we've already established with our fiscal '23 work that we  executed through the end of March. 
Nicholas Campanella: All right. Great. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just a broader question on inflation. Everyone is dealing with it. Just on the gas side, just every day we look at the strip, it's up. And how is that kind of translating to broader customer bills? Do you kind of feel comfortable if we remain at these levels? And if we're at a structurally higher kind of commodity environment through your 5-year plan, just confidence level in executing on this rate base trajectory? 
John Akers: Yes. Nick, it's Kevin. There's a couple of things in that -- in your question. Let me first start with, as you heard in my opening comments there, our team has and continues to stay very attuned to and keep affordability at the top of the mind and focused on how we can help. You heard the things that our customer service organization, our customer advocacy team are doing with outreach to energy assistance organizations, trying to find funds, get customers connected to that, find ways we can communicate proactively with customers. For example, during the last winter period, we sent out, think about 1.5 million notices, whether those were phone calls, where those were text, whether those were e-mails, those sort of things, trying to alert customers to pending colder than normal situations moving into the area. 
 We're also sending them through those various channels, including social media as well, information on weather tips, energy efficiency, conservation, gas cost pricing, all those sort of things. So we're trying to stay very active with our customers, very up-to-date with our customers on the cost, but also find ways where we can help through our energy assistance LIHEAP programs, point them to the locations where they can receive assistance. But also, as you know, we're a very efficient operator. We work very hard at that. 
 You've seen the things we've done over the last couple of years through Uri. Those sort of things will continue those efforts as we monitor the gas price over the next few months, and we'll continue to communicate with our customers where we can. 
 And to the second part of your question there, I think where you were heading regarding our capital investment program over the 5-year horizon, I think as you can see in our slide deck right now, we run somewhere between 85% to 90% of our capital investments focused on safety and reliability. That needs to continue and will continue as we continue our strategy to modernize our system for safe delivery of natural gas as well as, as you just heard me mention that growth out there to support that high growth rate, particularly when we're adding 12 months ending March, 57,000 new customers out there and 15 new industrials. 
 So we've got to continue to meet that growing positive and strong demand for natural gas across our service territory that we anticipate will continue going forward, as we talk to builders and developers out there. Even with interest rates at 5% right now, they're continuing to see strong demand as well. So that's what we're going to focus on, how we help the customer, how we can connect the customer to the right assistance organization, maintain our focus on O&M where we can and then continue to invest in our system. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. 
Insoo Kim: First, just more on detail for the quarter. I saw on the pipeline side, the O&M year-over-year was up a decent bid. On the distribution side, down year-over-year. Is this just more timing between the quarters? And I know from a guidance perspective for the year, it doesn't seem like much has changed. But just curious on some clarity there. 
Christopher Forsythe: Insoo, this is Chris. Yes, certainly, it's timing on some of the -- just the timing of the work on the pipeline, those are longer lead time projects that need to be planned further out in advance. So just in timing around that. And on the distribution side, to stand a little bit, we had a slightly lower bad debt expense in our current year's fiscal second quarter compared to the prior year. So that's -- those are really kind of the 2 key drivers for those variances that you just described. 
Insoo Kim: Okay. Got it. Second question, just more curious on your observations. We've talked probably over the past couple of years, just about the different changing narratives on the future of gas, and it seems like the latest narrative has changed maybe more to a positive for the sector just on energy, security and all that stuff. Have you seen that play out at all on the ground, whether it's customer growth or just demand for gas in your various jurisdictions, if there was ever really an impact from this narrative on the negative side over the past couple of years, just seeing -- I know you had mentioned customer growth or demand being stronger than expected. So I don't know if that would tied to any of that in your thoughts. 
John Akers: Yes. Thank you, Insoo, for your question. And -- as you know, we've continued to have strong growth. We're very proud of our service territories. We believe they are the best in the country. We're fortunate with the states and support politically, the economic development chambers and their hard work that bring these sort of customers into the communities we serve today. But we've seen strong support for natural gas for a long time throughout our history. And I think you could also see that through the customer advocacy, customer choice builds that we have in 6 of our 8 states out there, we get very good support from a regulatory perspective, the political perspective, the community perspective. So I think we've always been in strong supporting natural gas environment. .
 I think the thing that -- to get to the crux of your question, it's probably changed here lately is the conversation that the general public is now seeing and wanting to feel around energy security. Natural gas in our industry has always been there behind the scenes, delivering, transporting, storing natural gas to meet those winter demands, especially as you go back to Uri and how well some of our distribution and transmission systems performed during that piece of it. We've always kind of been out of sight, out of mind. But with the unfortunate geopolitics that are going on now, the war in Ukraine, energy has been thrust to the forefront. 
 And I think those are the things we're hearing is people are wanting to know that natural gas is going to be there. It's a viable choice for them. It's abundant, and they're talking to us about national energy security and how they can have that in their community. So those are the sort of things we're hearing now. And as I said, we're very fortunate and blessed and appreciative of our jurisdictions and their support for natural gas. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just staying with this inflationary focus. I mean what's your view on inflation's impact on your CapEx budgets? How are you thinking about that just vis-a-vis some of the latest pressures we're seeing across the industry? What percentage of your CapEx is exposed to material labor for instance, obviously, that are perhaps disproportionately inflationary? And what's locked in contracted labor where perhaps you may not see that? But on balance, is there an upward bias in your CapEx budget on that alone effectively? 
John Akers: Yes, Julien, let me start here and Chris, certainly can add some color if he wants to get into percentages or not. But as we've talked about this before, I couldn't be any proud of our procurement team, our operations team, our engineering teams, all working collectively as we -- we're coming through the last year or so, the pandemic inflationary discussions were picking up. We were seeing some of the signs out there. They were very active. You heard us talk about going from a 3-month to 6-month inventory of materials and pipe. You've also heard us continue to talk about that we have 95% to 100% of our pipe on the ground for the remainder of this fiscal year's steel needs. And that we are already beginning identification and getting steel pipe to the mills for '23 and identifying cost as far out as '24 in those project needs. 
 So all to say for us, our team has been very proactive about identifying the types of materials, whether it's pipe, valves, fittings, those sort of things, plastic, steel, increasing our inventory, increasing our lead time on that, so we're not just in time. And yes, we've seen some increases in pipe -- steel pipe, especially from a couple of years ago or 3 years ago. But we think we're doing everything we can to take advantage of current pricing now to lock that in, as I said, as we buy out into the future for those sort of things. 
 Really, the only pressures we've seen right now from a supply chain perspective, we've seen a little bit on the technology side and occasionally on some meters, but it corrects itself over time as our team continues to work through our vendors and suppliers to get additional supplies into our warehouses. So I hope that helps answer your question. Chris, anything additional you'd like to add? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I think the same. Just really, Kevin, the other -- Julien, the other point to make is there are contract labors, they're executing on the capital projects. We've got contracts with them. We're currently -- we are in constant communication with them. Many of these contractors go back many, many years with us. So over the years, we have worked with them to manage their cost pressures and needs. And so we've been able to do this at a -- in a bite-size increment, if you will, rather than having to -- holding the cost really low for a long period of time and having to rush now to catch up to market. So those are long-term relationships with those contractors, have given us the ability to bleed in any higher cost over an extended period of time so as to mute the inflationary pressure on our capital spending. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But not ready to quantify in aggregate, but maybe you do see some of these inflationary pressures that could fall through. And maybe to clarify that further, even to the extent of which you do would you perhaps defer some of these investments in order to keep your budget flat? Or is there an argument that would just be made you move forward with the projects despite some modest inflation? 
John Akers: We haven't seen anything right now, Julien, that hadn't already been contemplated in the numbers that we've discussed here to date. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. And so just one other -- please go for it. 
John Akers: No, that's all I had. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. And then just on the transportation and RNG front, you made some comments here. You talked about 30 projects here. It seems like -- or 30 opportunities sees your verbiage. Can you expand a little bit more about what that could amount to just from a sort of a capital opportunity perspective, if you will? 
John Akers: Yes, Julien, as you've heard us say before, we're not in the upstream side of that. We're not investing right capital upstream of the meter right now. So truly, all of our investment would be the sales meter, based -- whether they're digesters, they're landfills, biomass, sewer gas capture those sort of things. We're really receiving the processed gas and transporting on behalf of our customers. And right now, those evaluations are truly what is near system, what is close to systems. So any capital investment at this time would be modest and it would be to maybe extend a short distance to a facility. But really, we're not investing upstream at this point. We're really transporting that RNG on behalf of others. 
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Lots of projects lingering there, but largely sales element. 
John Akers: Correct. Helping our customers where we can reduce their carbon footprint and be the conduit. That's why we have the 72,000 miles of pipeline system we have today is to move that gas around it. And be part of that environmental equation to get that gas to the -- [ burn it here ]. 
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Dan Meziere for closing remarks. 
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you all for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-09 09:29:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Atmos Energy Q1 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of IR and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Hillary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 25 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal '22 first quarter net income of $249 million, a $1.86 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, reflects the ongoing execution of our operating, financial and regulatory strategies.  Consolidated operating income decreased $276 million in the first quarter, primarily due to a $39 million decrease in revenues associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21, and through the end of last fiscal year, we've reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a three to five-year period.  These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate is recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with interim periods that will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact of these excess deferred tax liability refunds, operating income increased $16 million over the prior year quarter.  Slide 5 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety reliability capital spending, totaled $47 million. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by $4 million.  For the 12 months ended December 31, we added 55,000 new customers, which represent a 1.7% increase. These increases are partially offset by a $20 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. As a reminder, in the prior quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load during that time period. Therefore, the period-over-period variance partly reflects this timing difference.  The first quarter increase is primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities. Consolidated capital spending increased to $684 million. The $227 million period-over-period increase reflects increased system modernization spending in our distribution segment, spending to close out Phase 1 of APT's Line X and Line S2 projects and project timing.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of this spending focused on modernizing a distribution and transmission network, which also reduces methane emissions.  We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have implemented $73 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities, and currently with about $36 million in progress. Slide 17 through 24 summarizes these outcomes.  Slide 16 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. To date, we have completed over $1 billion of long-term financing. Following the completion of the $600 million 30-year senior note issuance in October, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately 2.7 million shares for $260 million. And we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $260 million.  As of December 31, we have approximately $295 million in net proceeds available under our existing forward sale agreements. As a result of this activity, we have now priced a substantial portion of fiscal '22 equity needs and anticipate satisfying the remaining equity needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing, was 59% as of December 31.  Additionally, we finished the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. In January, we completed the issuance of $2 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.635% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April.  Following this offering and excluding the interim Winter Storm financing, our weighted average cost of debt decreased 3.81% and our weighted average maturity increased 19.23 years, which further strengthens our financial profile. Additional details for financing activities, our equity forward arrangements, as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 7 through 10. And we continue to make progress on securitization.  Yesterday, the Texas Railroad Commission unanimously issued a financing order authorizing the Texas Public Financing Authority to issue customer rate relief bonds to securitize costs associated with Winter Storm Uri over a period not to exceed 30 years. We currently anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing we issued last March.  And in Kansas, we started our securitization proceedings at the Kansas Corporation Commission in late January. Based on the current procedural schedule, we are anticipating a financing order by the end of our fiscal third quarter.  Our first quarter performance was a solid start to the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans are on track which positions us well to achieve our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance of $5.40 to $5.60. Details around our guidance can be found in slides 12 and 13.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my update today, I want to take just this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees. It is through your dedication, your focus and effort that we safely provide natural gas service to 3.2 million customers in 1,400 communities across our eight states. Thank you for all you do every day for Atmos Energy.  I also want to take this time to thank our hometown heroes, our first responders and emergency responders for their continued dedication and support for all of us. And as you just heard, we're off to a great start. The results Chris summarized reflect the commitment of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as we work together to continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  During the first quarter, we achieved several project milestones that further enhance the safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification of our system. For example, at APT, we placed into service Phase 1 of a two-phase pipeline integrity project that will replace 125 miles of Line X. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT's system. Phase 1 replaced 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. Phase 2 includes an additional 62 miles of 36-inch pipeline and is anticipated to be completed late this calendar year. Additionally, we completed the first of a three-phase project to replace our existing Line S2. This 91 mile, 36-inch project will provide additional supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the East side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. Phase 1 replaced 21 miles of this line and Phase 2 will replace an additional 18 miles and is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Phase 3, which will replace the remaining 52 miles, is expected to be in service in 2023. During the completion of Phase 1 for Line X and Phase 1 for Line S2, our teams used recompression practices to avoid venting or flaring over 70,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is an excellent example of how Atmos Energy's environmental strategy is being integrated into our daily operations.  APT's third salt dome cavern project at Bethel is now approximately 80% complete and remains on track to be placed in service late this calendar year. As a reminder, this project is anticipated to provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  As I mentioned during our November call, we have started work on a 22 mile, 36-inch line that will connect the Southern end of APT's system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This new line will support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the North of Austin in both Williamson and Travis County in Texas. This line is expected to be in service late December of this year.  In addition to those system modernization projects, we continue to make progress in advancing our comprehensive environmental strategy that is focused on reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and reduce our environmental impact from our operations in the following five key areas; operations, fleet, facility, gas supply and customers.  For example, across our storage facilities, we utilize advanced methane detection technologies, including gas cloud imaging, acoustic monitoring, forward-looking infrared handheld cameras, and laser-based remote methane leak detectors. At APT storage fields, we are making progress with the installation of the remaining gas cloud imaging cameras for continuous methane monitoring and anticipate completion by the end of this fiscal year. Our RNG strategy focuses on identifying opportunities to transport RNG for our customers. We currently transport approximately 8 BCF a year and anticipate another four projects to come online within the next 12 to 18 months. Those four projects are expected to provide an additional BCF a year of RNG capacity.  Furthermore, we are evaluating approximately 20 opportunities that could further expand our RNG transportation. Two, Zero Net Energy Homes are underway in Texas; one in Taylor and the other in Dallas. The home in Taylor is being developed through our partnership with the Williamson County Habitat for Humanity, and we estimate the home to be completed in late March.  And in Dallas, we are working with the Dallas Habitat for Humanity and estimate construction of this Zero Net Energy Home to begin mid-March. These homes use high efficiency natural gas appliances, coupled with rooftop solar panels and insulation to minimize the home's carbon footprint.  These Zero Net Energy Homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas play in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner. Providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy feels safe in thriving communities.  And finally, over the next five years, we will invest $13 billion to $14 billion in capital to support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of our distribution, transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We will also replace 100 to 150 steel service lines which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next five years.  Our first quarter activities and initiatives reflect the continued successful execution of our strategy to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as we continue our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  These efforts, along with the strength of our balance sheet, our strong liquidity, has Atmos Energy well positioned to continue serving the vital role we play in every community; that is delivering safe, reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time and interest this morning. We'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Richard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting on O&M. How is the balance of work and timing tracking versus expectation? Just curious if you have any early sense here, I guess directionally where expenses are putting you in the guidance range?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, sure, Richard. This is Chris. Good morning. Really the O&M spending was generally in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our current year compared to the prior year quarter, the prior year quarter was a bit of a low mark. So when you look at where we are now, it's roughly a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter. But we looked to the midpoint of our guidance compared with last year's O&M levels, that's about a 3% increase. So right now, we're still seeing O&M trending in that $7 million to $10 million range. And we believe that at least where we are as we sit today that that spending will continue to be in line with this expectation.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks for the color there. In the mid to the high level, could you outline the expected timing of major base rate cases over the next, say, two to three years, including the APT system?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. Again, we typically execute '18 to '22 annual regulatory filings. The fiscal second quarter is our busiest filing period. So we'll be making a number of GRIP filings at APT as well as in our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions. We'll also be making a regulatory filing in Mississippi in early March as well as in Louisiana, and a secondary filing in July in Mississippi. So a lot of activity to be coming over the next several months. Much of this will be implemented by the end of the fiscal year. We will also file our West Texas and Mid-Tex filings, generally at the end of March 1, first part of April, and those are scheduled to become implemented on or around October 1. So really at start of the next fiscal year. With respect to APT, the general rate case is scheduled to begin in our fiscal 2023 time period. So we've factored that into our five-year plan. So the GRIP filing that we'll make here in mid February will be the last GRIP filing before that annual rate proceeding next year.
Richard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks for outlining all that. Thanks for the time today.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Richard.
Operator: Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Congratulations on everything here. Just following up here -- good morning. Just following up on Kansas here. Obviously, the process is kicking off here. Can you talk a little bit about the expectations on the tenders are ultimately on that proceeding? And frankly, anything else that you think is relevant that we should be talking about in terms of parameters? Obviously, kudos on getting the RSC finalized here?
Kevin Akers: Thank you. So on Kansas, as I said, we're kind of in early stages right now and beginning the securitization proceedings. In the terms of tenders, it will depend upon what market conditions look like. We're obviously going to be looking to seek AAA rating on that. And we will be working with our banking partners as well as with the staff to determine the appropriate period to make these securitization costs, if you will, as affordable as we can for our Kansas customers. But it's still too early to tell where we are at this point.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Understood. And actually related, especially considering the progress that you've made with the RSC, how are you thinking about the rating agencies moving forward here on removing the outlook here, removing the negative outlook to be specific?
Kevin Akers: Yes, the dialogue we've had with both Moody's and S&P has been -- they've basically been telling us we're going to wait to see what the Texas Railroad Commission financing looks like. That was issued yesterday. I'm sure they have a copy of that. We're anticipating conversations with those rating agencies hopefully here this second fiscal quarter.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And a quick last one here just on tax rate, obviously depressed here. The comments in the transcript here, to the extent to which you should expect to continue to see this rate going forward, the lower rate, just given the tax liabilities?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. So our effective tax rate for the first quarter was about 5.9% that we're anticipating, including the excess deferred tax liabilities and effective income tax rate in the 7% to 9%, given that we are refunding these excess deferred tax liabilities over the next three to five years, that effective tax rate should be in place in that general range over that time period. So when you back out the impact of the excess deferred tax liability refunds, the marginal effective income tax rate is in the 22% to 24% range.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, yes, indeed. Thank you for clarifying that. Sorry, actually, if I can, could I ask the last question on APT. 
Kevin Akers: Sure.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: How are you seeing customer growth trend here? Some of your peers talking pretty robustly of late. Just curious to see what you're seeing, especially the impact to some of your other jurisdictions here, like APT?
Kevin Akers: You're talking about particularly here in the metroplex, Julien. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been growing just a little bit north of that 1.7% here in the metroplex, probably in the 40,000 to 45,000 customer range per year. It's a lot of residential growth. And as you get those rooftops, as you know, you'll have the supporting commercial businesses as well. We do have a few industrial customers that come in the metroplex area. A lot of this is also showing up in residential rooftops down in the Austin corridor as well. Again, that's why we're putting in that Permian connector line down there; forecasted growth, forecasted demand, expansion down there with all of the people moving in from various locations across the country. That's what we're seeing at least here in Texas across our other jurisdictions, as we talked about, it's been a really good diverse mix of not only residential but as well as industrial growth as well. I think at our fourth quarter call that we added 45 industrial customers last year that we anticipate once they're fully online or utilized somewhere between 12 BCF and 14 BCF of natural gas, that equates to around 200,000 residential customers. And these are customers that are in the metals, they're in healthcare, they're in the auto industry, a good variety of distilling. So we're getting a good mix of natural gas demand and response for the product across all sectors, whether that's Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, good industrial growth. We continue to see good residential growth in our Colorado properties with people coming from the West Coast into Colorado, and then again outside of Olathe, Kansas property.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.
Operator: Our next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is just on cost overall. I think you've recorded in the fiscal first quarter that distribution gas cost of over $7 per Mcf versus I think $4 range last year. And thinking about that and other potential inflation factors, whether it's labor or other commodities for CapEx, any -- when you do the math, any concern there in your ability to achieve, whether it's a '22 or beyond CapEx while managing the bill impact?
Kevin Akers: Yes, so I'll start out and then hand over to Chris. The short answer is no on that. As you've heard us talk about at the end of last quarter when we kind of rolled out our five-year plan and forward-look there, we did have some of this contemplated in our O&M projection that Chris just talked about. As well you've heard us also talk about we worked very hard throughout the procurement team to stay ahead of some of our needs. We try and keep at least a six-month inventory. We're trying to increase that now, whether that's at our supplier or in our own warehouses. And as you may have heard us say before, all of our steel pipe needs for this fiscal year, all those projects that we just talked about, all that pipe is on site, at location. So we feel like we're in really good shape. We stay ahead of our needs to our vendors. So at this point, I think given the work for our procurement team, given that we've got our pipe needs, at least our steel pipe needs covered at this point, we anticipate that our O&M levels that we have baked in right now should be able to handle what we're seeing right now. It should not have any impact on our CapEx spend going forward in the short range.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thanks for that reminder and that's good color. My second question is kind of related to that or maybe on the other side. I think we've seen the gas basis in your Texas region kind of widen out, again, talks about takeaway capacitor concerns. You're obviously working in line to connect with the Kinder line there, but any views on future gas cost forecast in your Texas jurisdiction and any opportunity to potentially take advantage of that spread in the near or longer term? Acknowledging that from a hedging perspective, I know you're limited on kind of what you can do.
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start out and again we'll see if Chris wants to add anything here. I'm looking at the Waha prices this morning, cash prices, and we’re sitting at $3.60 out there. The forwards for Waha if you're taking a look at that for the April off period is around $3.45, something like that. So no crystal ball here, obviously. But I think when you look at the rig count that we're seeing, just last week of well over 600 rigs in the U.S. working, about half those in the Permian, we're seeing production levels that are now in the 14 BCF to 14.25 BCF a day range with projections. I think by the end of this calendar year first of '23 in the 16 BCF a day range, I would hope that kind of supply pushes these prices down even further. But we'll have to wait and see on that piece of it. But very encouraged again by the number of rigs, the supply that's coming online. And just one last comment there on the basis differential. Remember that that's part of our Rider REV mechanism we have on APT and 75% of that goes directly back to the customer to reduce those rates, so that is a sharing mechanism there for those customers' benefit. Chris, anything additional?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, I think the Rider REV comment is spot on, Kevin. We don't -- we certainly think about that in our planning process. It is not a material portion of APT business.
Insoo Kim: Got it. But at least it would help with the bill headroom, so I guess indirect benefit on that front.
Chris Forsythe: Yes.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
Ryan Levine: Good morning.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
Ryan Levine: I was hoping just to follow up on the APT expansion to the Permian Express. Can you elaborate on kind of the timeline in terms of executing on that project and if you're seeing any other commercial development opportunities off of APT that are getting more traction?
Kevin Akers: Well, as I said in my opening remarks there, this is going to be a 22 mile line, 36-inch. It certainly will help us meet the forecasted growth in that Austin corridor, both in Williamson and Travis counties down there. And we anticipate this line to be in service late this calendar year, it could be first of next year. We're well on our way with all the necessary aspects to get that project rolling forward. So you're right. Those are the projects outlined; Phase 2, S2 Phase 2 and Phase 3 of S2 and then project here are the major projects we have on tap for APT along with the finalization of that third cavern there. And those all again will bring that diversity, reliability and versatility to APT system, many areas to bring supply and increase capacity.
Ryan Levine: And you have all the right aways [ph] and supplies already procured to help execute on that project?
Kevin Akers: Yes, we have the majority of what we need to begin work on that at this time.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And switching gears in terms of the financing plan. You outlined your maturity schedule. It looks there is a bigger maturity due next year with some floating rate. Curious how you're thinking about staggering your debt maturities going forward and also in context of the recent decision from yesterday?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. So the big maturity that you see next year is the $2.2 billion interim Winter Storm financing we executed last March. We're anticipating with the completion of the Texas securitization process by the end of the fiscal year that we would use the net proceeds received from that securitization process to repay that $2.2 billion. So, again, setting aside the $2.2 billion, when you look at it, the average maturity is 19.23 years. We're in a very, very good spot. And as we continue to execute the five-year financing plan, Dan is here and his team are looking at all the options that are on the table in terms of laddering and maturity schedules, all in with the idea of trying to minimize costs for our customers.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then last question for me. There continues to be talk of LDC assets in the market for sale. Curious if there's any change in how you're looking at deals and if you're spending any more time contemplating acquisitions?
Kevin Akers: Well, as we've said before, we certainly don't have our heads in the sand here. We always got our eyes and ears open on the market and what's going on. But we believe we have the best properties out there and we're in very supportive natural gas states, communities, we have very supportive regulatory and legislative jurisdiction that you know with six of our eight states having All Fuels Bill. Another one, Virginia, I believe has something in the legislature this year along the lines of an All Fuels Bill, so that could move us to seven of our eight jurisdictions. As we talked about this morning, these communities are growing. They're expanding both residential, commercial and industrial. And as we've talked about before, we don't need an acquisition to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we talked about in our plan. So at this point, we remain focused on executing our system modernization strategy, as we continue our journey to be the safest provider in natural gas services.
Ryan Levine: I appreciate the time. Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.
Dan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and again thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our Web site through March 31, 2022. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Diana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 37 and more fully described in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you could join us this morning. On this Veterans Day, I would like to take just a moment to say thank you to those who have served our own forces. Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call.  I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21, once again, reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I've said it before and I'll say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our Company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.  As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our 10th year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers. As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems the reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our human needs customers during winter storm Uri.  Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution transmission systems further replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline, all to further and enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services.  Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication, as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission, and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22. For example, throughout the pandemic, we've increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job site for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.  Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas Project and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We're nearly 60% complete with the development of APT third salt dome storage cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22, and will provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  We're also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line X Phase 1 integrity replacement project, and we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system, as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. Also, nearing completion is the 1st phase of three phases of our Line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline.  We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end, and Phase 2 of Line S2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch, 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we began work on a 22-mile, 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year ‘21, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction ready from customers. Thank you, team, for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%, and 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 for electronic methods of payment such as bank drafts, credit cards, and online banking.  During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and environmentally impact from our operations in the following five key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers. Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions in our environmental impact included such things as our ongoing distribution transmission, and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities that APT's troughs at each storage fields, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment, that APT sales in fiscal 22. We will also deploy additional wellhead, fixed based, or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal 22 We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with no bleed or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced late detection technology, and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities.  We've continued our R&G strategy of identifying customers who wish to use our system to transport the R&G they produce. We increased the amount of R&G transported across our system to approximately 8 BCF a year, and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities. In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles and to C and G for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first zero net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado.  This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We're currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emission. In this summer, we joined the low carbon resources initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies.  Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at one of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility. To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees still are feeling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year. All about supporting schools and students with books, meals, and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked in community gardens. We hosted utility fares, Energy Assistance Blitz to share the warmth for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support, and for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters.  The financial and volunteer resources of our team provided translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. I'm very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent, and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal '21 has us well-positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance, as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal 26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12, representing 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. As we entered fiscal 21, we conservatively planned for lower non-residential revenues while planning to execute our normal O and M program. Though nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully manage our O&M spending focusing on compliance-related activities.  Non-residential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed about a penny to fiscal 21 results. As a result, actual earnings-per-share slightly exceeded the higher-end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.  Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth and most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our distribution segment declined about $8.5 million primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year.  Bulk collection activities resume in the third quarter, and we continue to offer flexible payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance, and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time. Consolidated [Indiscernible] and expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, and continued records establishment, and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts. Capital and spending increased to $2 billion with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability, and environmental performance of our system.  In fiscal 21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases. Excellent in the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement for the regulators and additional $69 million annualized operating income during our fiscal 2022 first quarter. As of today, we have four filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations.  We fully satisfied or fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30th, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall.  Additionally, we improved our financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended, an increase in non-liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retained the $250 million accordion feature, and we replaced our expiring 364 day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million, 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm hearing. Additionally, we issued a new $5 million shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps.  Currently we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job in upstanding for $2.2 billion in cost effective interim financing to pay for the gas costs incurred during winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30th. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity, and strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, we just well-positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and financial profile can be found on Slides 9 to 12.  We've also fair to winter operations for the next fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain and inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply chain has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full and a weighted average cost of gas for approximately $3. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements in approximately $4. Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately 1/2 of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range.  The remainder of anticipating gas supply needs, we satisfied through a combination of baseline purchases at person on prices, peaking contracts, and spot purchases but needed. Today, we had transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.  As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchase gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process journey involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact in customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices to energy conservation, as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.  Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings-per-share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent to prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2 and 72%, with 8.8% increase over fiscal '21.  Finally, fiscal '22, capital spending is expected to rise by 25%, and it's expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22 as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning return within 6 months when the test period end. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 and $7.40.  We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending per system replacement modernization, and environmental improvements, consistent expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next five years, we anticipate total spending at approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate-based growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated right base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21. From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million and we assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined; we had assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes are currently being considered at the federal level, and the financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our Balance Sheet.  Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our Balance Sheet analysis to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings-per-share guidance through fiscal '26. In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85% after factoring in a favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing.  Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be our preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22. we expect to rage our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding Securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Bureau Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of regulatory asset that will be securitized under the Statewide program.  The final order stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs are prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed our Securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions, and a procedural schedule has been set, with all proceedings expected to begin in January.  Finally, annual filing mechanisms with the primary means to which we'd recover capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend, and generate returns necessary to attract the capital we made to finance our investments, and these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes these mechanisms to fiscal '26. In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings for $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years, '22 and '23.  The execution of this plan to modernize our system to disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6 to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026, and as you can see on Slide 25. The execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable and it help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our Company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate basis situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice.  The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdiction support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system.  We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you've heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. 8 of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. Additionally, our Middle Tennessee, service territory ranks among the fastest growing areas in the U.S. as well, and we continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 BCF a year once they are fully online, and these customers are from various industry, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries.  Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities. Delivering safe, reliable, and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kody Clark: Hey, it's actually Kody Clark on for Julien. Good morning.
Kevin Akers: Good morning, Kody. How are you?
Chris Forsythe: Good morning, Kody.
Kody Clark: Good. So first on the delta between the 11% to 13% rate base growth and the 6% to 8% EPS growth. I know there's a good deal of equity contemplated in plan, so definitely cognizant of the dilution there, but low like regulatory lag, given the recovery mechanisms that you have across your jurisdiction, so I'm wondering if there are any other drivers of that delta that you would call out.
Kevin Akers: Yes. At this time, it really is just the financing plan that we've assumed over the next five years as you point out, it's the equity component. But again, that's factored into the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we highlighted on the call this morning.
Kody Clark: Got it. Okay. And then building off that question a little bit. I'm wondering how you would characterize where you see yourself in that 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth range. Is it more towards the midpoint or top 10? I'm asking because the past couple of year-end updates I've seen you performed well during the year, rebase off that strong number and then reiterate the 6 to 8% growth after that. So are you being a little bit conservative or how would you think about that?
Kevin Akers: When you look at the ranges that we've put out this morning, the $5.40 to $5.60 for fiscal '22, and then the $7 to $7.40 in fiscal 2026. If you take the midpoint of both of those ranges and kind of do the math and that implies about a 7% annual growth rate per year.
Kody Clark: Okay. And then last one if I can just sneak it in that. We've seen the market multiple for gas utilities decline relative to the electric peers throughout the year, and at the same time has seen some healthy transaction multiples for some of the gas utilities. So how are you thinking about potentially monetizing an asset or assets to offset the ATM equity needs. I know you've stated in the past thing you'd like your business mix, but wondering if that has changed at all.
Kevin Akers: I'll start on that, Kody, and then Chris can certainly jump in if he wants to. Again, as you said, we've been very proud of our assets. We continue to be very proud of them. You look at the results here. You talked about the diversified growth that we just mentioned on our call here, the mechanisms, the regulatory relationships that we have out there, our involvement in the communities. We're very proud of the asset mix we have today. So we're not contemplating at this point anything, but continuing the excellent operation of those assets.
Kody Clark: Great. That's all I had.
Chris Forsythe: Kody, I’ll add…
Kody Clark: Okay. Very good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Richard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to start with this Permian highway project. Does it create incremental base and takeaway or just better connectivity to the Permian highway pipeline?
Kevin Akers: Well, that project you're talking about where we are connecting up in the Permian highway project, that's just to meet the growing demand of that Austin corridor down there to feel that diversification of a load as well for us. So, that's what we're looking to do. We're connecting to that Permian Highway project to bringing that supply up from the Sal instead of moving gas around from the north or bringing it over from Katy at this point. So for us, again, it's another supply optionality to meet the growing corridor that we have down there, and then some supply diversification.
Richard Sunderland: Understood. And then I realized the entire five-year capital plan is up year-over-year. But is there anything notable in the 2022 CapEx step-up or just any color there?
Kevin Akers: Well, I think nothing that steps up again. We go through a very rigorous and robust planning process each year that looks at the one, three, and five-year projects levels that are out there. As you've heard us say before, we take a long look at the projects and how I meet integrity management goals, compliance goals, but we also look at it from that growth perspective, what has been the band going to be out in the future and how do we meet that demand? So I think that's all contemplated within this. That's why we spiked out those projects. So I think this is just a further iteration of meeting the supply needs to demand and diversification that we continue to talk about.
Richard Sunderland: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Insoo Kim : Thank you. My first question is on just general gas hedging. I know that the salt dome is coming on and that's going to help just the storage capacity but whether it's in Texas or other regions, you're following what the hedging rules are that the commissions of those states put on limited to that, but just whether it's a result of Uri or some other spikes we're seeing in the current winter season, any dialogue with any of the commissions on potentially changing the hedging strategy?
Kevin Akers: Yes, I'll start out and then see if Chris wants to add any color. We have dialogue every year with our commissions, as you know, laying out what our anticipated gas supply plan is for that year, how we perform the following year. We're open to that feedback. But right now, both our commissions, our gas supply teams are very comfortable with the plans we've been able to put together. And you heard that combined with our storage opportunity, our base load purchases, those sort of things, how well they have us positioned going into this winter heating season. So we'll continue those dialogues, continue those conversations, we'll continue to meet with our jurisdictions at the end of each winter season and work collaboratively with each of those jurisdictions as they see it going forward.
Insoo Kim : Got it. And my second question, the proposed methane fee that's in the reconciliation package. I think more on the upstream and midstream side of things, but just curious on your thoughts or whether it's direct or indirect, any potential impact or ramifications you see for your utilities or just the gas LDC industry in general?
Kevin Akers: There's still a lot of moving parts and pieces to that legislation. A lot of conversation is still going on at the federal level with that. And quite frankly, as they continue to do that, we'll monitor that. But I think the thing is you've heard us say before that the United States, as we sit here today, is among the top five producers in natural gas. We're among the top five and proven reserves in the world today. And for us to continue to have the economic growth, the economic stability, and security that we need from an energy perspective and a national perspective, we're going to need to have a continued diversified energy portfolio. And we believe natural gas certainly brings that to the table with the flexibility, reliability, and abundance it provides everybody. We just outlined through today's update how natural gas plays a key role in that. So we'll continue to monitor that, but we will look for a diversified energy portfolio to continue to meet the demands of the U.S.
Insoo Kim : Got it. We'll leave it there. Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Hey, Steve.
Stephen Byrd: Hey. So a lot of topics have been covered. I wanted to touch on two things. Maybe first, just back on the natural gas pricing impact, that Slide 25, I think is quite constructive to your point, we don't see big shocks. Are there dynamics though, whether it's in 1 jurisdiction, where the impact is greater or an assumption that could change, it could cause that fairly modest increase in '22, for example, to be a little bit different, or worse for any jurisdiction, or I guess, my bottom line question is, what kinds of shocks could cause that to be different, or is it really hard to envision that?
Chris Forsythe: Go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin Akers: Go ahead. I'm sorry.
Chris Forsythe: Well, I don't foresee anything that could impact us at this point, those are averages as you know, that we put out there, we continue to look for diversification across our pipes as you heard us mentioned earlier, we're across 37 pipelines, multiple basins. So we tried to blend in as much diversification and flexibility as we can within our systems. We have these annual mechanisms that tend to level out, increases over time, and I think for conservative on those gold bars there on 25, as you've heard us say before, we're looking way out into the future on some of those prices, and as outlook today, while hard at cash basis is $3.98 Katy to $4.40 and I believe the non-Maxx is at $4.91 today.  So I think again, with the great work, our gas supply team does, where our assets are located on multiple pipes, availability of storage, that sort of thing, we're in a really good position. Chris, anything you want to add? Yes, I'd say, too as we saw about what could potentially move the needle in terms of pricing, and it's again, it's weather patterns. It sums in the pricing dynamics that Kevin just described. Also, just customer usage and to all that's very, very difficult to predict and trying to estimate or come up with a true impact, and again, with an 8-state footprint that covers a fairly significant geographical difference that you could have weather patterns that impact the eastern portion of the U.S. that are completely there from Texas and what we might experience in Colorado.  So really, it's, I think, pretty challenging for us to say across the 8-state footprint if there is a trade key driver to watch out for. I think it's going to be a combination of all of the items you just mentioned; pricing, the basins that we have access to. They're very highly liquid basins. So we were able to have a good keen eye on what that pricing situation customer usage, as well as just general weather patterns.
Dan Meziere: That's really helpful, and then shifting over to financing, I am going to step back a little bit on this question. Atmos is in a really interesting situation. You have perhaps the fastest growth rate in terms of your rate base among companies we cover. We love the growth outlook. What's interesting is that the amount of equity needed compared to your market cap is high, and the value of the stock, the PE multiple of the stock is dramatically lower than what we're seeing in private asset sales, including not just sales of a 100%, but just selling a minority stake, we've seen dramatically higher valuations.  So I guess the math my suggests that a sale of a minority stake at the kinds of multiples we've been seeing on other situations would be dramatically less dilutive than this kind of volume of equity issuance that we're looking at over the next 5 years. How do you all kind of think about the possibility of selling non-controlling minority stakes, potentially much higher valuations than just where your own stock is trading? How do you-all think about that?
Chris Forsythe: It's a challenge for us because we don't have the holding Company structure like many of our peers do. So when you look at each of our divisions or each of our states, that's all under one corporate umbrella. So we can't do a minority sale for a single jurisdiction. The way we're structured today, it would have to be a partial assets sale or a certain geographic region that we would have to exit, and as you heard Kevin talk earlier with Kody, we're very happy with the assets that we have, the jurisdiction footprints.  We do see the dislocation between what the private market is a place of evaluation on versus what we're seeing from the public traded perspective and we think again to the public and trade perspective, the fact that 97% of our asset base is located in jurisdictions that are supportive of natural gas, both from a policy perspective, the regulatory perspective, the fact that we have very strong customer growth is currently being a little bit underappreciated, and that's where we just need to continue to remind those investors that we are very well-positioned in the country to capture the growth experienced in our jurisdictions and have jurisdictions that have strong support natural gas.
Kevin Akers: Yes. Chris, I'll just add you've got 19 years of EPS growth and 38 years of consecutive dividend increases all support our strong position as well as what Chris had about our regulatory jurisdiction. So we're going to continue to operate and do the things we do within our strategy. We've outlined, we think it's solid. We think it fits our jurisdictions well. So really believe we are in a good position going forward, not only for our customers but our communities and all stakeholders.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levine: Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning.
Kevin Akers: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: Hey. What are the drivers of where you would fall in the 22% range for EPS? Can you talk about some of the pluses or minuses that may determine the outcome?
Chris Forsythe: Key pluses or minuses obviously will be the execution of the regulatory strategy. Customer usage patterns, whether although we are [Indiscernible] normalized, 97% of our jurisdictions, we can see a little bit of that weather year-over-year, and just timing of O&M spending as we continue our ongoing system safety and compliance work, those are the key drivers that we generally point to when we're talking about where we can fall within the 6% to 8% range.
Ryan Levine: On the O&M point, think you're assuming 3%, 8% to 3.5% O&M cost inflation in your '22 outlook, what underpins that? Seeing some more robust inflation figures more recently, can you elaborate on what's driving that assumption?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. It's the ongoing expansion of our compliance work. You've heard us talk before that we're in a mode now, doing more compliance work every year rather than holding back and waiting for another rate case to occur. So as we continue to look at the rule making that's happening at the federal and the state level, we work to try to get ahead of that, so that when it comes time for a compliance deadline to have met, we're getting there. Well in advance on when that deadline is and we're also just looking at the system needs and what we want to be doing from a safety perspective. So when talked about advanced leak detection technologies and further expanding that across our footprint, as well as just ongoing hydrotesting at inline inspection work on our large-scale distribution in some of transmission lines to make sure that better system is operating as safely as it possibly can.
Ryan Levine: Okay, and then from the federal legislation, what do you view as the impact to Atmos more broadly?
Kevin Akers: Are you referring to the infrastructure bill there, Ryan?
Ryan Levine: The infrastructure bill and potential tax reform or tax changes.
Kevin Akers: On the infrastructure bill itself, as you know, it's very comprehensive, we're still working our way through it, but some of the things that we've seen that we are focusing in on our incentives in there for high-efficiency natural gas appliances, systems that regard hydrogen research and development, as well as there's some, I think, $500 million or so over the next 5-year increase for low heat. That's in there as well. The rest of it at this point, we're still working our way through the detailed piece of that with, with our peer companies and with the American Gas Association.
Ryan Levine: Okay, and then last question for me. Are you talking to any of your regulators within your few jurisdictions about rate-basing electrolyzers within the LDC?
Kevin Akers: Short answer is no.
Ryan Levine: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Dan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us today. The recording of this call is available for replay on our website through January 6, 2022. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the ATO Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 29, and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Kevin Akers. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I wanted to comment on the NTSB preliminary report issued Monday, regarding a worksite accident that occurred in Farmersville, Texas, on June 28. I want to begin by thanking the first responders and emergency responders for their support and assistance. As indicated in the report, parties to the investigation include the Railroad Commission of Texas, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Collin County, and the City of Farmersville Law Enforcement, Bobcat Contracting, Fesco, and Atmos Energy. All parties to the investigation are working closely with the NTSB to help determine causal factors at this time. As a party to the investigation, we cannot provide any additional comments on this matter, and we're not going to comment on any pending litigation. Finally and most importantly, I want to say that our hearts, out thoughts, and our prayers have been and will continue to be with those that were injured and the families of the deceased. I will now turn the call over the Chris, and rejoin you shortly for some closing comments. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 third quarter net income of $102 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $97 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $515 million or $4.20 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings in both prior year periods excluded $21 million or $0.17 non-cash income tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 [led] [Ph] to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the continued execution of our strategy, and was in line with our expectations outlined in our last quarterly call. Additionally, our results for the nine-months, ended June 30, continue to reflect the impact of refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to our customers. As a reminder, last quarter, we received authorization to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to APT's customers, and distribution customers in Tennessee over a three-year period. During the third quarter, and in July, we received authorization to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to distribution customers in Louisiana, Virginia, and for certain of our customers in our West Texas division over a three-year period. The refund of excess deferred taxes is recognized as reduction in revenue, and a reduction to income tax expense. However, there is a timing difference between the recognition of the income tax benefit, which is recognized in our annual effective tax rate when the regulatory orders are approved, and the corresponding reduction in revenue which is recognized over time as it is billed to customers. This timing difference resulted in a $0.06 benefit during the nine-months ended June 30. We anticipate that most of this timing difference will reverse during the fourth quarter. Taking a closer look at the performance, consolidated operating income increased about 13%, to $814 million, during the nine months ending June 30. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $170 million. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $15 million as we are continuing to benefit from strong population growth in virtually all of our service territories. New customer connections increased 1.68% over the last 12 months, and net customer growth over the same period was 1.82%. Sales volumes for commercial customers continue to trend in a favorable direction. Third quarter sales volumes increased 25% over the prior year quarter, and were consistent with what we experienced before the pandemic. Year-over-year, commercial sales volumes were 6% higher. We experienced an $8.5 million decline in service order revenues in our Distribution segment primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense has increased about $22 million year-over-year. We even focused on keeping our customers connected to our system by offering more flexible payment arrangements, and helping our customers find financial assistance to help with their bills. During the third quarter, we resumed collection activities, focusing first on the largest past-due balances, which are typically the oldest. Additionally, we continue to remain in close contact with our regulators about our customer outreach efforts. And we believe this bad debt expense will be recovered over time. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt increased $8 million year-over-year, and $22 million quarter-over-quarter as we increased pipeline maintenance activities in each of our segments and in-line inspection work at APT. Additionally, we experienced a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locate requests as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage prevention efforts. The O&M spending we experienced during the third quarter was in line with our expectations we outlined during the second quarter call is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Consolidated capital spending decreased 3% to $1.36 billion, with 80% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability to modernize our system. The slight year-over-year decrease primarily reflects timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to modernize our distribution and transmission network to further enhance its safety and reliability while reducing methane emissions. From regulatory perspective, we've completed all the filings that will impact fiscal 2021. We are now focused on filings that will impact fiscal '22. To date, we've completed $186 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. As a reminder, many of these regulatory outcomes reflect the lower revenues due to the refund of access to deferred tax liabilities. However, this amount does not include the corresponding reduction in income tax expense. And we currently have about $53 million in progress, most of which it's expected to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Slides 13 through 28 provide additional details. From a financing perspective, the third quarter was relatively quiet. During the quarter, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately [1 million] [Ph] shares for $100 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $213 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. We have now priced all of our fiscal 2021 equity needs as well as a portion of our fiscal 2022 equity names. As we said before, using our ATM equity sales program is our preferred method to meet our plant equity needs. During the third quarter, we issued a new $5 million self-registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM equity sales program. The new shelf in ATM program positions us well to meet our future financing needs while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Securitization is also another tool that will help preserve the strength of our balance sheet. On June 16, Governor Abbott signed HB 1520 Texas Statewide Securitization Program to address the extraordinary gas costs incurred by natural gas utilities during winter storm hearing. Last week, we filed our application to participate in the program seeking to recover $2 billion. We are currently awaiting a formal procedure schedule from the Texas Railroad Commission. We are also making progress with our securitization application in Kansas, anticipate making a filing before the end of the fiscal year. As of June 30, our equity capitalization was 60.2% excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter. And we finished the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found in slides seven through 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. Based on our third quarter performance and what we were anticipating for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of this range. We anticipate the fourth quarter activities will mirror what we experienced during the third quarter with sales volumes consistent with seasonal norms and O&M spending that we'll be continuing to focus on system maintenance and compliance. Slides 11 through 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I'll now turn the call over to Kevin or his closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. I appreciate that financial update for everybody. Over the last year, we have highlighted the progress we are making in the five key areas of our environmental strategy, which is focused on reducing our carbon footprint and environmental impact in areas of gas supply operations, fleet facilities, and customers. One element of the strategy has been to evaluate opportunities to expand the amount of RNG re-transport across our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. During the third quarter, our largest RNG suppliers announced plans to expand and modernize their facilities beginning in early calendar 2022. Once completed their RNG production is expected to grow by approximately one BCF a year. Additionally, an RNG location here in the Dallas Fort Worth area recently indicated they will soon have the ability to add approximately one BCF a year in RNG transport to our system. So currently we have almost seven BCF of RNG on our system. And once these new projects are fully online, we anticipate this to increase to approximately nine BCF or 3% of our distribution sales volumes. I am extremely proud of our gas supply and marketing teams for their continued effort and work to grow opportunities for Atmos Energy customers to utilize RNG. In support of our environmental strategy, we recently joined the low carbon resource initiative in June. This initiative currently has over 45 member companies participating in their five-year initiative to bring industry stakeholders together to accelerate the development and demonstration of low and zero carbon energy technologies through clean energy research and development. We're proud to be a sponsor of the low carbon research initiative, and has worked to identify cost effective, reliable and diverse solutions on the path to a clean energy future. Alongside our goal reducing methane emissions by 50% from 2017 to 2035, and our demonstrated investment in technologies like renewable natural gas and combined heat and power supporting the low carbon research initiative further reinforces our commitment to the environment through a global platform of collaboration and innovation. And as you just heard, the continued successful execution of our strategy and our strong balance sheet position have us well-positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient, and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We'll take this closing opportunity to thank all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional dedication and commitment, providing safe and reliable natural gas service to a 1400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their efforts continue to be recognized by our customers with an outstanding satisfaction rating for our agents, as well as our service technicians in excess of 98% job well done. I will now turn the call back over to Dan and open it up for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question, maybe for Chris, just on the financials, great year-to-date results, the upper end of guidance you reiterated, I think that's great. I think when we think about the timing of the asset, refunds, that'll get screwed up in the fourth quarter, even excluding that, it seems like the way that your run rate is, you could potentially have a result in 2021 that's better than that high-end. Just trying to think about as you prepare for 2022, are there certain things like [indiscernible] O&M into 2021 or other items that you're doing to increase the flexibility as you try to achieve another good year in 2022?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. So, Insoo, so really 2022, we're still working through that right now. So, I'm not really going to comment on that today, but we'll update everybody on that coming November. But again, what we're trying to accomplish right now for 2021 is to focus on the system maintenance, some of the which we were able to safely defer over the last first six months of the fiscal year, as you waited to see what our customer counts are going to do in commercial sales volumes and so on and so forth. So, really the focus right now is to kind of get back to a more normalized O&M run rate. As we see now, that's the pandemic at least at this moment isn't impacting our top line revenues in a material way and remain focused on that, that system maintenance that's in the inline inspection work. Again, we're also saying a lot of economic activity, which is driving the line locates. And as I mentioned we had 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase. We're up 10% year-over-year. So it's a busy time right now, certainly here in the Dallas Fort Worth area and our focus will be to continue to executing on the strategy as we get to the end of the fiscal year.
Insoo Kim: Got it. That makes sense. Definitely appreciate all the fluidity here as we continue to move through this crazy environment. Second question and for Kevin, you mentioned on the growth in the flow through of our junior system. We were just talking with another company where Minnesota, they passed legislation there that could potentially give seems like the gas utilities the way to increase investment in RNG while getting some type of regulated rate of return. Although I think there's still some negotiations that need to be had on exactly that process. I think our conversations in the past pointed to in your jurisdictions; you continue to have conversations with the various stakeholders on advancing something like that. Are there any updates that are any progress that you've made on that front for your states?
Kevin Akers: It's pretty much the same story. Insoo, I appreciate the question. We continue to talk to all key stakeholders about these opportunities. As you've seen here, we talked about the increases that we just recently observed on our system. We continue to share with them the opportunities we're seeing out there. And we continue to work with our legislators and regulators in Colorado as they're probably the closest to most on putting legislation on the books right now. So I think for us, this fits nicely into our, as I said earlier on our overall environmental strategy and the focus areas that we'll have, we'll keep an eye on these projects as they come to fruition. We'll certainly share those with our regulators and legislators and keep them abreast of the opportunities, but for now that that's been our focus and making sure we get those opportunities available to customers across our system.
Insoo Kim: Understood. That's all I had. Thank you so much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Ryan Levine with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. I was hoping that you'd be able to speak to if you're seeing any disruptions in your suppliers around high density polyethylene and how that may impact your business?
Kevin Akers: Ryan short answer is no. At this point, our procurement team does an exceptional job of working with multiple suppliers and vendors, as well as our operations units to make sure we stay ahead of projects, that that's part of our risk management profiles to lay these projects out in front early. So we know what our materials needs are going to be. And then our procurement team goes to work in laying those out, having them stay so we can have access to that material when it's needed. And we also try to keep a significant amount of supply on hand and ready as well. So I think at this point, we're in really good shape. I just checked with our procurement. It's a timely question, checked with our procurement team last week, and I feel like we are in pretty good shape. I know there is some issues around the semiconductor and technology side across the world right now, but we are not seeing any constraints or issues on our supply.
Ryan Levine: If the disruption in the industry were to persist, is there a point in time when it could be more impactful for your outlook?
Kevin Akers: I'm not going to speculate Ryan on what could be out there. As I said, we're not seeing or having any supply issues on any material at this point. So, we continue to be in really good shape. And as far as an IT perspective, our team there said they have all the equipment that they need at this point, and we're in good shape going forward.
Ryan Levine: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.
Dan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. And thank you again for joining us. Recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through September 30, 2021. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the ATO Q2 2021 Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead sir.
Dan Meziere: Thank you Kevin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which will be -- which we will reference in our prepared remarks are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 29 and more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Kevin Akers. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. During this quarter we continued to successfully execute our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. This strategy along with the exceptional dedication and effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy continue to benefit our customers in the form of safe and reliable natural gas service. This was clear during Winter Storm Uri as the modernization of our systems especially over the last 10 years provided the reliability necessary to meet the human needs requirements of our customers. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our gas supply and gas control teams and the many operations, transmission and underground storage employees that dedicated countless hours to keeping natural gas safely flowing during Winter Storm Uri. The winter storm certainly highlighted the importance that reliable natural gas systems, diversified supply portfolios, system versatility along with underground storage capacity bring to delivering safe and reliable natural gas service. As an example of system modernization and reliability, I want to highlight our third Atmos pipeline storage salt-dome project. This project nearing 50% completion will provide an additional five to six Bcf of cavern storage capacity when in full service late 2022 or early 223. This new cavern will provide us the continued capability to meet the growing demand in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, as well as allow it us to safely perform the required regulatory compliance work, while meeting the current needs of our customers. Additionally, APT has started our Line S-2 replacement project that will create an enhanced supply hub to the east of the growing Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and bring additional supply in from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays. We anticipate this 36-inch 90-mile project to be completed in three phases with the final phase being complete in 2023. The storm once again highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. After incurring unprecedented gas costs during the storm, we were able to quickly finance these purchases with the issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt for an all-in debt cost of 83.4 basis points. This financing is structured to provide us flexibility as we work with our regulators to recover these costs. In Kansas and Texas where we incurred most of our extraordinary gas costs, new legislation was introduced to minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented costs through securitization. The legislation in Kansas was signed into law on April 9, and allows utilities to file for the permission from commission to securitize these costs for a period of up to 32 years. In Texas, the legislature is considering a statewide securitization program. Under this program, natural gas utilities would have the opportunity to apply to the Railroad Commission to have their extraordinary costs securitized by the Texas Public Financing Authority and to use the net proceeds to pay off the debt they incurred to finance these natural gas purchases. This legislation has been passed by the house and is currently being considered in the Senate. In our remaining states, we anticipate recovering gas costs through our normal purchase gas cost mechanisms over a 12 to 18-month time frame. I am very proud of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees in the work they do every day to provide safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their dedication and commitment have Atmos Energy well positioned for success in the second half of the fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to Chris, for an update on our financial performance. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 second quarter net income of $297 million, or $2.30 per share, compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $514 million, or $4.01 per share, compared with earnings of $418 million, or $3.42 per share in the prior year period. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our distribution segment, lower O&M spending and a reduction in our annual effective tax rate. During the second quarter, APT began refunding $107 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to its customers over a three-year period. Additionally, in Tennessee, we began refunding $17 million in excess deferred taxes over a three-year period. As a reminder, these refunds result in a reduction to revenue and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to our net income. Since these excess deferred taxes were approved during the second quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to reflect the lower tax expense that we will realize this fiscal year. The application of this lower annual effective tax rate to our results for six months ended March 31, resulted in an $0.11 benefit during the second quarter. However, we can only recognize the associated reduction in revenue, as it is built over the last six months of the fiscal year. Therefore, this $0.11 benefit will be fully offset during the third and fourth quarters, as we build those lower revenues. Consolidated operating income, increased about 17% to $681 million during the six months ended March 31. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $130 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $11 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in several of our service areas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.87% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.61% net growth across our eight-state footprint. We experienced an $8 million decline in service order revenues in our distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. Additionally, our provision for bad debt expense increased almost $9 million in our distribution segment, compared to the same period last year. This combined $17 million decrease, represented the most significant impact to our financial performance through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Our commercial sales volumes have turned significantly better than our expectations since the start of the fiscal year. After 15% period-over-period decrease in sales volumes during the first quarter, commercial sales volumes increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and were about 2% higher year-over-year. While some of this increase is attributed to the significantly colder weather experienced during the second quarter, commercial sales volumes have trended less than 5% below the two-year weather-normalized average, which much of that -- much of that decrease experienced during the first fiscal quarter. Throughout the second quarter, we have noted steady improvement as economic activity has started to pick up. Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt expense, decreased $14 million. O&M in our distribution segment was about $6 million lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower travel costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage setting was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the completion of some nonrecurring well integrity work in the prior year period and conservative O&M management, as we evaluated how our revenues would materialize over the first six months of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending decreased 15% to $846 million, with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending. The decrease largely reflects the timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year, to further enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy, focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact to customer bills, while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And we have currently about $145 million in progress. Slides 27 and 28 summarize the key attributes for these outcomes. And slide 17 summarizes our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Due to the historic nature of Winter Storm Uri, we experienced unforeseen -- unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases during the month of February of approximately $2.3 billion. To help pay for these costs, we completed $2.2 billion of long-term debt financing in March. As a reminder, gas costs are a pass-through cost and recover in all of our jurisdictions. However, in Kansas and Texas, due to the size of the costs incurred, our regulators issued orders, authorizing natural gas utilities to record regulatory assets to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the storm. As of March 31, we have recorded a $2.1 billion regulatory asset with approximately $2 billion recorded in Texas and approximately $77 million recorded in Kansas. As Kevin mentioned, we have the ability to securitize these costs in Kansas and we are carefully monitoring the proposed statewide securitization legislation in Texas.  We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 2.5 million shares for $239 million. And we settled forward agreements on 4.5 million shares for approximately $461 million of net proceeds. As of March 31st, we have approximately $116 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements and we have about $313 million available for issuance under the ATM program. We intend to satisfy our remaining fiscal 2021 equity needs through our ATM program.  As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter was 60.4% as of March 31st and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide 7 to 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As a reminder, approximately 70% of our distribution revenues are earned through the first six months of the fiscal year. And substantially, all of our pipeline storage and other segments revenues are earned under a straight fixed variable rate design. Now that the winter season -- winter heating season is over, we have more clarity around our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year and we believe fiscal 2021 earnings per share will be at the upper end of our guidance range.  We anticipate our sales volumes to be consistent with what we typically experience during the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate that our service order revenues will frank consistently with the first six months of the fiscal year. We've also reflected in this guidance the decrease in revenue over the last six months in the fiscal year as we refund excess deferred taxes to our customers and we have updated our income tax expense guidance range to reflect the impact of these refunds.  Finally, we anticipate that O&M will increase modestly during the second half of the fiscal year and be in line with our original O&M guidance range. We continue to meet all of our compliance requirements and we will begin to address some of the system maintenance work we were able to safely delay during the first half of the fiscal year. Slides 11 and 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers : Thank you, Chris. I appreciate that financial update. As you heard we continue to be focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and remain on track to meet our fiscal 2021 targets. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to execute on our strategy that supports our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. During our last two quarterly calls, I've shared the progress we are making to minimize our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers, including the work we are doing to increase the amount of RNG we have on our system today and to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. To date, we are evaluating approximately 30 RNG projects across our systems. As a reminder, our environmental strategy is focused on five key areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. Today, I want to highlight how Atmos Energy is working to reduce methane emissions as we modernize our business and infrastructure by investing in innovation and technology. The following examples of how Atmos Energy will meet our goal to reduce methane emissions 50% by 2035 as well as how we are helping customers understand the role that natural gas plays in reducing their carbon footprint at home in an affordable manner. We recently installed a new methane monitoring technology at our Tri-Cities underground storage facility called gas cloud imaging camera. This 360-degree fixed base camera will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. And if necessary the technology will send alerts including pop-up alerts with images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts.  In addition to our existing methane monitoring and detection equipment, we are finalizing plans to deploy fixed base and mobile technologies throughout our underground storage operations. Additionally, we are in the process of installing a fuel cell to generate low-carbon electricity at one of our facilities. The fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint for that facility. We anticipate the fuel cell will be operational by the end of this calendar year.  With affordability and community support always top of mind for us, our Colorado team partnered with the Greeley-Weld County Habitat for Humanity Group to build a zero-net energy home for a local family. This will be the first of its kind for local habitat homes. This home is designed to receive a home energy rating system score of zero, which means the home produces the same amount of energy it consumes over the course of the year by using efficient natural gas appliances, better insulation and solar technology.  The total utility cost for this home is anticipated to be approximately $350 per year, which is expected to provide about $2000 in annual utility bill savings relative to the average US home. This solution is significantly less expensive than an all-electric home. We are also working with builders in two Texas locations to design homes that are expected to yield similar environmental results. Our employees put their heart, sole and time and energy into projects like these every day to modernize our system, to do our part to protect and preserve our environment for generations to come and to support the communities where they live and work. I'm very humbled by their compassion and commitment to be good neighbors. Providing this family with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost-efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. Last year legislation was designed to promote the use of all energy sources and maintain customer energy choice which we refer to as all fuels legislation was passed in Louisiana and Tennessee. During the second quarter, similar legislation was passed in Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. And earlier this week, the Texas Senate passed HB 17 and it is now on its way to the Governor for signature. Assuming it is signed, six of our eight states will have passed all fuels legislation. The successful execution of our strategy and our financial position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and well and into the future. I will now open up the call for questions. Dan, I'll turn it back over to you and the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is for Chris. For the quarter -- thank you for explaining part of what drove that year-over-year increase. It seems like there was a timing of the asset lower tax rate, but that's going to be trued up by the end of the year with no yearly impact. But even without that it seems like it was a relatively strong quarter versus what we had expected at least. Could you just describe how much of that increase was largely expected by you, or how much was just an additional benefit whether it's from rates or non-weather normal volumes? And guiding -- reiterating your guidance, are you positioned pretty well at least at that midpoint at this point?
Chris Forsythe: Sure, Insoo. And good morning. So yeah, so a couple of things. I mean, the regulatory outcomes were pretty much in line with our expectations, primarily because that reflects the capital spending that we did in the prior fiscal year. So when we made those filings up late last year, they carry over into this year. So we had pretty good visibility into those outcomes. I would -- you noted the temporary timing difference around the update to the annual effective tax rate which will unwind by the end of the year. And then also two we were very conservative on the O&M spending in the first half of the fiscal year as we were able to kind of just take a wait-and-see approach with respect to how our commercial customers in particular would behave during the pandemic. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the performance there has been better than what we anticipated. So we did hold back some of the spending on the O&M side until we had a better sense where those revenues will begin to materialize. And now that we're out of the winter heating season and focused on the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll be modestly increasing that O&M spend. And given the momentum that we see with the regulatory outcomes, the commercial sales volumes beginning to trend in the right direction, as economic activity picks up and the fact that we'll do some modest increases on O&M spending, we feel confident that we'll be at the upper end of the range by the end of the fiscal year.
Insoo Kim: Okay. So upper -- okay. Got it. That's definitely helpful. Kevin maybe a broader strategic question then coming off of I think one of another utilities recently announced sale of a couple of their utilities, gas utilities at pretty impressive valuations. We've asked you with a strategic question on M&A before and obviously there -- you've talked about how there's robust organic opportunities at most of your jurisdictions. So I definitely appreciate that. But how do you balance I guess the valuation that the market is seemingly assigning given the recent transaction versus the ongoing financing needs you have? And at a certain point, does it make sense to potentially weigh those two to see what the ultimate portfolio mix would be ideal for Atmos?
Kevin Akers: No. Good morning. I appreciate your question. Let's just start with the transaction that you're talking about there and discussion around our assets. And again, as you heard Chris go through the financial updates, the performance for year-to-date, our historical performance, we remain very happy with our asset mix our regulatory construct. And again, Insoo as you know, we began to earn 90% of our investment in the first six months and 99% after 12 months. And we've talked about how that story is very simple, very straightforward easy for our folks investors all stakeholders to understand. And there are complications with these acquisitions as we go forward. That's why we like our plan that we have laid out today the performance that our divisions execute on day in and day out. But I think this transaction sends a very strong signal right to the market. In our opinion, it sends a very strong about the value of natural gas that it brings, particularly meeting the energy needs on a go-forward basis, the value of these assets that have been somewhat questioned over time, but are now should be coming into clear focus. So I think it sends a very strong signal to everybody about the role that natural gas is playing continue to play going forward and the value of this infrastructure out there for the reliability, the certainty the affordability that natural gas brings. So very happy to see that have occurred, but remain very, very happy and positive with our regulatory construct and performance of our assets.
Insoo Kim: Understood. Thank you so much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Stephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Congrats on continued great performance.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Stephen Byrd: I wanted to just discuss renewable natural gas a little bit more and maybe just at a high level get your thoughts on the kind of the overall magnitude of that potential in the longer term away from kind of very near term just thinking through, how meaningful that might be? I know it's a broad question. Just interested in your longer-term take on that.
Kevin Akers: Yeah. I think as you've heard us say we continue to grow the number of projects that we have out there under evaluation. We're up to 30 now, and it's a mixture of dairy as well as landfill gas. We've got a combination of those things we're looking at now. We're doing about 5.5 to 6 piece a year. That's a little north of the 2% range I think when you compare that to about the average distribution sales volumes that we move across our system on an annual basis. I think we'll continue to see these projects come up and with the help of some of these energy firms that are out there I think we'll continue to see a good opportunity to bring them on our system. But right now to hang a number on it I think it's still a little bit early. As I said, we're at the 2% of our overall distribution sales throughput volumes. I think there's opportunity there for us. But until we can get in, and see what infrastructure may be required how near are our systems they are is that going to require pipe, or what's required on the other side of that through digesters, processing equipment those sort of things. I think it's still a little bit premature on our side to try and hang a target or a number out there, where this could be, but we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that continue to come up.
Stephen Byrd: No, that's fair. Great. And then maybe just – I wanted to dig in a little bit more on Texas and lessons learned from the winter storm. You all gave a very good and very thorough update on sort of everything going on in Texas. Again, kind of a longer-term question. Just interested in your take on sort of other changes that you see that would be needed in Texas whether that's operational changes, changes to contract structure? Just other things on your mind longer-term to ensure kind of we don't have a repeat of what happened in Texas?
Kevin Akers: No good question. And I think our team, as you heard me say, I mentioned our gas supplier our gas control groups they're continuing to go through and evaluate things that occurred throughout that 12 to 14 day period there. How we can improve our system things we can put on our system to monitor that additional supply diversification that we can maybe bring on to our systems. So that's continuing to go on. But really those are things we do each year. And I think one of the strengths as I pointed out in my earlier remarks for us is our planning process. Those projects, I mentioned are already in our five-year plan have been in our five-year plan to allow us to continue to fortify grow and think about where those next challenges could be. Just for example, again the storage piece of that. So as we develop those salt cabins we're not only thinking about past performance we're thinking about growth on the system as well. And other places to fortify are, whether it's APT infrastructure or distribution systems as well. So I think the ongoing evaluation of that performance continues, but I'm very proud of how our system performed through that and we'll look for whether it's technology solutions, or supply diversification again to help us through that. And the last thing, I'll mention on that is around that supply diversification. You look at I'll just use our APT asset as an example here. When that supply stopped flowing coming in from the West from the Permian there, we were able through the network that we've been building and fortifying and enforcing over the last 10 years to pull from the North out of the Barnett out of Oklahoma, we fortified that with additional supplies coming out of Carthage from East. We had our fortifications in place, where we could pull from Katy up from the South. All of those points helped us get through that situation during that storm and we needed all of those and that versatility in the system to be able to pull that and pull it at those levels as well as the many suppliers that we have across those areas to be able to bring those into those points, so I'm very proud of how we performed during that period and how our system continues to provide very many options for us going forward.
Stephen Byrd: That’s really great color. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now live.
Ryan Levine: Hi everybody. In terms of the salt-dome storage project that you highlighted in the Dallas region, could you speak to what additional development opportunities you have on salt-dome storage within your footprint more broadly?
Kevin Akers: Well, in our footprint salt-dome is here in Texas. This is our third cabin here in Texas. Those are behind the APT system to meet the demands of its customer base, its firm needs there for human needs customers here, on the Mid-Tex system. So our other storage fields, throughout our other properties are all traditional sandstone reservoirs. There are no salt-dome projects on or available in those other facilities. But we do have contract storage services, that we use through our interstate supply contracts and with third-party sources as well to supplement our peaking capacity needs. And some of that may potentially be salt. Right now, most of that is generally sandstone, reservoirs itself. So right now, we've taken as I said a good hard look at this third cabin development here. And see that being able to help us for the near to longer-term at this point.
Ryan Levine: Are there additional opportunities within your footprint on the salt-dome side, that you have the resource or commercial arrangements that you would be able to pursue, to the extent that it was needed?
Kevin Akers: No. Again, let's think about storage. Storage for us is there to supplement our peak day at our interstate capacity to meet those firm needs. And the only opportunity for salt right now, as I said is here in Texas. Our other opportunities are sandstone reservoirs. And those are near market, near our large customer bases. So we continue to use those other 15 fields to exactly do that. So the only salt-dome available is here in Texas and right now our third cavern development, that's the one we're focused on.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then, in terms of the financing plan, I appreciate the update around the securitization proceedings in the different service territories. To the extent, that the Senate and the Governor support the proposal in Texas, does that crystallize financing plans for 2021? And can you provide some color around, how you're currently thinking about your equity needs, in light of evolving regulatory decision-making?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. I'll start, and Kevin, if you want to chime in as well? So yeah, if securitization does pass in Texas, it's our intent at this point to participate in that program which then would really I think crystallize, what we would do with the $2.2 billion that we executed in -- long-term debt that we executed in March. Kind of going forward, and when you think about our financing plan, setting aside, the $2.2 billion for a moment, we'll continue to finance our operations in a very balanced fashion using a mix of long-term debt and equity to finance our needs. So that, -- we don't anticipate that financing strategy to change. It's worked very well for us, over the last 10 years. And it's well understood by our regulators certainly the investment community. And we don't see that changing at this point.
Ryan Levine: So just a follow-up, to the extent that that were to happen, does that put off the table any additional equity financing needs beyond the forward agreements that -- and other programs you already have in place?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. If we have the opportunity to participate in the securitization program in Texas, and then, have obviously the opportunity to securitize the cost in Kansas, we would anticipate that our financing program -- our financing strategy would be consistent with what we've done in the past.
Ryan Levine: I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is now live.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. Kevin, assume the securitization passes, we're also seeing signs of inflation across the economy that people are concerned about, which will make it more difficult to control your O&M cost which you've certainly done a phenomenal job over the last years now, that certainly put some pressure on rates and create some headroom issue, because we obviously know it's important to keep rates at the general inflation or less. But does that put some pressure on 7% to 8% CapEx growth there? How do you think about that, because obviously that's the key to your earnings growth?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Yeah. You broke-up there just a little bit. So let me see, if I can answer your question here. I think when you look at the supply right now the abundance of the supply, the pricing it's come back down to I think today, Waha was in the 250 range or so. You look at the growth across our system and our average bills right now are in that $49 to $50 rates absent what we've gone through this past winter obviously. But I think, given those supply pricing and given the growth we have on our system, the signals we can send on our annual mechanisms right now, I think, we're very comfortable with our costing and how we compare on a go-forward basis with that, as well as meeting our O&M and compliance needs. And again, you've heard me talk before about at our all-in cost right now, that again assuming that we get securitization spread out these costs on these abnormal winter pricing events here that at $5 to $5.50 right now, that equates to about $0.01 to $0.015 on a kilowatt rate. So, I think, we still remain very, very competitive out there compared to electric pricing on a go-forward basis for us as well.
Charles Fishman: Yes. But as far as -- and I'm sorry I broke up. I'm putting myself off speaker here. I -- obviously, regulators look at the general level of rate increases. And will some of these costs that really aren't -- well inflation and higher interest rates not in your control, will that put some pressure on your CapEx growth, is what I was getting at the 7% to 8% annual growth rate that you've targeted over the next five years?
Kevin Akers: I'm not anticipating any pressure at this point on our CapEx program. Again, we've modeled a lot of things going forward into our five-year plan. We continue to monitor the need for our projects and can pull things forward or push some things back. So I think, right now, given the layout that we have for this year and the next few years going forward, I feel very comfortable with what we'll be able to execute upon.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And if I might ask a second question. I was intrigued earlier this week, when the utility in Phoenix mentioned, they were very proud of the industrial growth going on in Phoenix and they said, it was second only to Dallas. And quite frankly that surprised me. I know, that's electric and we're talking gas here. But -- and industrials are a small percentage of your revenue. I think, I'm looking at slide 13, it looks like 2%. But are you seeing -- in this industrial growth, are you seeing higher gas demand specific to certain chemical industries or anything that might give you an extraordinary boost in revenues from the industrial sector going forward?
Kevin Akers: Not that I would say would equate to an extra boost, if you will. I think we see, certainly as the vaccines have started to roll out, the economy to your point has started to pick back up. Things are opening back up. We see some of our industrial customers across the eight states get back to what we would call pre-pandemic levels. Now some of them stayed at that because, they were associated with the specific needs of that whether the medical industry or metals industry, those sorts of things held steady throughout it. But those that kind of pulled back during that color period have now started to pick back up and hit at a normal pace. To your point, we continue to see new additions and expansions across our system. But I don't know that, I would categorize it at this point as an extra boost. We're very proud to see the growth from an economic and a utilization of natural gas standpoint. And it seems to be a good diversified industrial load from auto, to the distilling industry, to the metals industry, but we're very proud to see that, but nothing that's been unanticipated at this point.
Charles Fishman: Okay. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.
Dan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through June 30 of 2021. Have a good day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-02-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Atmos Energy’s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.
Dan Meziere: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today’s presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today’s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 25 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker today is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We’re off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate count outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution segment and lower O&M spending largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments. Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental $15 million in operating income. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $6 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in North -- in our North Texas Distribution business. For the 12 months ended December 31st, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas Distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint. The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduce consolidated operating income by approximately $9 million this quarter, primarily in our distribution segments. Quarter-over-quarter operating income fell approximately $2.5 million due to global commercial demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. And bad debt expense increased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our r distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than prior year, primarily due to non-recurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M management during the first quarter of this year. Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million, but 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the timing of product spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of spending focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute a well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and currently, we have about $32 million in progress. Slides 18 to 24 summarize these outcomes and slide 17 outlines our planned fillings for the remainder of the fiscal year. During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost effective manner with maintaining the strength of a balance sheet. Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieve the weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares for $122 million. And we settled forward arrangements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net proceeds during the quarter. As of December 31st, we have approximately $247 million net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal ‘21 activities through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31st, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. During the first quarter, Moody’s and S&P maintain their ratings with the stable outlook. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide six through nine. So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regular -- regulatory activities were in line with our expectations. As we continue to the winter heating season, we continue to remain cautious given the unpredictable nature of that pandemic. However, with yesterday’s reaffirmation, we remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you can see, from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next five years. Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training, and invest in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years we’ve invested more than $11 billion company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure. Over 80% of which was allocated to safety and over the next five years we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000 miles to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast iron [ph] by the end of 2021. To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a pipeline safety management system following the American Petroleum Institute 2015 publication of the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by reviewing practices, policies and procedures, as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in the industry. This quarter the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12th, related to the incident that occurred at Dallas, Texas residents in February 2018. The field and gas investigation and lab reports confirmed that unrecorded third-party excavation damage on mechanical equipment caused a major crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon. Because third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention, through such efforts as auditing our third-party line locating services, to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to provide damage prevention materials and ensure to corporate on notification. We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing hazardous condition is discovered if first responders are not already on site. As I’ve discussed before, we’ve enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format coupled with hands on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience all without sacrificing quality. These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. You may recall on our FY 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced five focus areas in our environmental strategy all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe replacement efforts. These five focus areas our gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also discuss the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint, as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers. Today I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we move nearly 5.5 BCF of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states for additional supplies. During the first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their facility to our system. Although, it’s too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport across our system, please know we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop the framework for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment. Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting, as we published our third Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report, as well as our Methane Emissions report. Both of these can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website. These reports paired with our Corporate Responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work. As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner. The long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They’re supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions for several of our markets continue to have strong long-term growth potential, most notably the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies in an environmentally responsible manner. The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well-positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry need -- energy needs now and in the future. I appreciate your time this morning and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we’ll take any questions that you may have and I’ll turn it back over to the Operator.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning, Jeremy.
Kevin Akers: Hey. Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start off, there was a lot of concerns in the market, obviously, last March when COVID hit and this was the first heating season where you guys get to see the full impact there. I am just wondering if you could expand a bit on, can you speak to the COVID impacts on the quarter versus your expectations and are you seeing impacts kind of consistent going forward into 2021 with your expectations overall?
Chris Forsythe: Sure, Jeremy. I’ll start here and Kevin feel free to jump in as well. As I mentioned earlier, we had about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact that we’ve attributed to COVID between commercial load loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense. On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that perspective, we’re pleased to see that that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We’ll continue to monitor that as we moved through the second quarter. We got a still another two months or three months left in our winter heating season, which by the end of winter heating season, we’ll have about 70% of our distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year and we’ll have some more clarity around what the impact of the margin line item will be. Same thing with the service order revenues, a lot will be contingent upon when we resumed full collection activities and we’re working with our regulators on that keeping you abreast of what we’re doing there and but, again, that is completely in line with our expectation.
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Jeremy, the only thing I’ll add to that, as you’ve heard us say many times before, our team, our risk management compliance team, our operations team, our shared service group, continue to adhere and follow to our practices and protocols are in place, again, allowing us to continue to execute at the highest level on all fronts. Even though we’ve seen an increase in some parts of our territory in a number of cases, we are glad to see the vaccine start to be rolling out across our service territory as well. But we believe with those practices, protocols and things we’ve been able to have in place over the last few months w will continue to execute on a go-forward basis at a very high level.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. Thanks. And maybe just kind of turning over to O&M, given the O&M tailwinds you have realized already. What are the main drivers and timing of your expected O&M growth over the course of the year?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we’ve assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will, our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that we didn’t need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the new customer load loss was materializing. In fact, we’ve got a better handle on that now. And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we’re still reaffirming the O&M range that we initially put out last fall. So, again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities, as well as other activities designed to mitigate risk. As you heard, Kevin talked about, third-party damage, we’ll continue to step up our efforts in that particular area, as well as just other system maintenance activities that are not necessarily compliance oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain it. You’ve heard us talk before, we certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet compliance purposes just to meet just in time, but we’re also keeping an eye towards what our requirements are further down the line later in a fiscal year or into next year, so that we are well ahead of those compliance requirements so that we can meet those dead time -- deadlines without having to wait to the last minute.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks. And you touched on this a bit in your commentary, but I was hoping you could expand a bit more, it seems for the -- in the marketplace for the LDC space as a whole, there’s some concern with regards to new laws that could impact, new gas hookups, effectively banning that. Just wondering, I guess, how you guys see that risk for you in your service territories and how I guess it compares for Atmos versus other LDC peers and difference that you see there?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Jeremy, I’ll start with that. As again, as I’ve said, we have very constructive rate jurisdictions and we continue to see growth, as Chris talked about across our service territory. We haven’t seen any bans, whether they’re on hookups or usage or those sort of things across our service territory. We stay in close contact through our stakeholder engagement strategy, our local public affairs and operating teams with our jurist -- city jurisdictions or state legislators as well. The -- keeping them informed of what value natural gas brings, what Atmos Energy is doing in their communities. So we stay in touch with them to keep them up to-date on an ongoing basis and haven’t really seen any even come up at the legislative level or through discussions regarding gas bans or clients hookups at this point.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And I think we might have seen some legislation and some states that were -- at the state level that would ban or stop these types of bans. Have you guys seen anything like that in your service stories or have any expectations for that?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. We’re working with associations and peer companies in all of our jurisdictions to keep an eye on bills that are being filed at the state level. These are called all fuels bills, if you will, you may recall that last year, there was one approved in Tennessee and one approved in Louisiana and we’re very encouraged by those bills. I think it highlights the value that natural gas continues to bring and the value of customer choice and choosing an affordable energy opportunity across our footprint. So we’re aware of those. We’re working with different associations. We’re working with our peer companies as well to make sure that their customers have that choice of fuel going forward.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. I’ll stop there. Thank you very much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: The next question is from Richie Ciciarelli of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Richie Ciciarelli: Hey. Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning, Richie.
Kevin Akers: Good morning.
Richie Ciciarelli: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the customer growth side, so obviously pretty impressive this quarter. Just can you provide any more color on what you’re seeing from the customer classes and more on the residential side with new customer hookups? And how is that kind of progressed into fiscal 2Q, thus far with, potentially more immigration into the State of Texas there?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. I’ll start and Kevin, you can certainly help out as well. Yeah. As I said, we’ve got 1.4% across the 8-state footprint, 1.7% here in North Texas and a lot of that is new residential growth. And it’s a trend that we started what we’ve really been seeing now for quite some time, but it’s continued throughout this pandemic. I think the stories are reading. You see more and more folks that are interested and maybe moving into the suburbs, looking for either a first home or getting a different type of home as they’re accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that’s what’s driving a lot of growth. Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust economic -- underlying economic activity in terms of companies evaluating the Dallas Fort Worth market and in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue to see how we come to Dallas there. There are cranes and construction everywhere. So I think we’re still seeing that underlying activity and a lot of that’s being driven by the residential class and that’s consistent to across our footprint and really in our first quarter, the number of hookups that we had from a residential perspective was one among the highest that we’ve seen in a number of years and we are grateful to see that not only in North Texas, but across most of our service territory.
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Chris, I just quickly add to that. In addition in some of our other states, Mississippi, Kentucky, we’re seeing industrial expansion as well, which is a good sign in this economy, as well as new industrial customers coming into those locations as well. So we see it, as Chris said, with residential commercial starting move in the Metroplex, but again, good opportunity on the industrial side and our other footprint as well.
Richie Ciciarelli: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then just on your equity needs, obviously, you mentioned you price a good portion of forward and then the remaining is through the ATM this year. But just as you think about kind of your long-term plan, keeping that cap structure towards the 60% level given you can an actual cap structure in Texas. I mean and just given where your multiple is, could you look at other forms, whether it’s portfolio optimization to kind of recycled capital or creating a whole cost structure. Just curious how you guys are thinking about that, just given where your multiple is today?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. I mean, we certainly we go put together our strategic plan every year, refresh it, if you will. I mean, these are things that we’re certainly thinking about. I’ll just remind everybody that when we put together our most recent five-year plan consistent with what we’ve done the last several years, all of our equity financing is already assumed in that five-year plan. So when you look at the 6% to 8% earnings and dividends per share growth, the projected share price that we put out, or sorry, earnings per share out in the out years that has assumed a wide variety of potential stock prices. And we put we put that guidance out after we’ve gone through that rigorous assessment. So we feel right now the current financing strategy is one -- that is one been successful for us in the past. We continue to believe that will be successful for us in the future. And but we will continue to evaluate certainly different structures. And we’ve talked about before in terms of asset dispositions, our 8-state footprint, we’re very, very comfortable with. We’ve got good jurisdictions, very constructive jurisdictions that we are very familiar with these jurisdictions and as this -- again, we always consider it but that’s not a key part of our strategy and we don’t need that type of activity to achieve the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth over the next five years. 
Richie Ciciarelli: Got it. That’s helpful. And just one more if I can flip in on the RNG front, you mentioned you’re looking over, I guess, 20 different RNG opportunities. Are you seeing this coming from new outlets or what’s kind of driving this demand? Is it more on the dairy farm side or landfills? Just curious what kind of customer base you’re looking at over there?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. You hit the answer there with the last two. It’s the dairy industry itself and its landfill projects at this point probably have the majority of those approximately 20 projects that we’re looking at and it’s scattered across our footprint. As we mentioned in their opening remarks, we just closed out a supply project with a firm there in Colorado and we continue to work on several others across Kentucky and other parts of our jurisdiction as well. But there are in that area. There are in the dairy side and the landfill side at this point.
Richie Ciciarelli: All right. Great. That’s all I had. Thanks for all the time.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Richie.
Operator: The next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is a follow-up to the customer growth one. When you look -- when we look at what’s embedded in your five-year growth plan, what’s the range of customer growth across your jurisdiction that you’re assuming?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Well, we put together the plan. We’re pretty conservative on that growth estimate. It’s difficult to estimate when exactly it will materialize. So we basically just assume that the same customer count or customer base that we have at the time that we published the plan and that -- and just let that growth be a bit of an upside for us as it materializes. Again, primarily, because it’s very difficult to forecast in which period that growth may occur.
Insoo Kim: Got it. So I guess when we look at the capital spend and the rate base growth, it’s not -- the bulk of it, again, is just infrastructure replacement and modernization as opposed to new customer line hookups.
Kevin Akers: Right. As I mentioned…
Chris Forsythe: Exactly. You can get a lot more here.
Kevin Akers: Yeah.
Insoo Kim: Right.
Chris Forsythe: Over 80% of the folks there.
Insoo Kim: Yeah. Got it. My other question is, to your comments on kind of safety improvement initiatives and actions that you’ve taken already and following up on the NTSB recommendations, when given the report that had come out about a month ago. Do you -- what do you see from either an O&M perspective or I guess, a capital perspective that could be elevated versus your plan or is that already embedded in the growth plan that you’ve laid out?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. Because we continually evaluate our practices and our protocols and adopted several the recommendations already into practices, you’ll find that on our website. We don’t believe that implementing the recommendations that have been laid forward will have a material impact on capital or O&M at this point.
Insoo Kim: Got it. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. Just another follow up on the NTSB report, so at this point, we’re just waiting on the final report. You’re waiting on the final report. Is there anything else that’s triggered by that final report? I mean, is there any -- is the Railroad Commission waiting on that report to issue some kind of final -- their final report, any of your city regulatory bodies, any insurance claims, any legal issues? I mean, is there anything else that’s out there besides this final NTSB report?
Kevin Akers: There’s a lot packed in there. Let me see if I can cover all those for you. The final report itself from our understanding, Charles, is merely just corrections or edits to the abstract and other information that you’ve seen out there already. And again, we anticipate that coming out really soon. And the Railroad Commission was a party to the investigation just as we were and they paused their investigation until the NTSB was complete. So we anticipate them to pick up their investigation sometime here soon. As you saw on the recommendations, they’ll be partnering with SAMSA [ph] to do an audit of our integrity management programs. So we anticipate them to pick their investigation backup and close it out relatively soon. I think on your other question, there is no open litigation related to the incident.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And looking at the preliminary reporter on virtual meeting last month, it appears the Railroad Commission and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration. They have to do this too. So, I guess, I mean, their report will include the things they have to do?
Kevin Akers: Yeah. We will all receive -- in that NTSB report, those recommendations, as you pointed out, were directed to several of the parties to the investigation, will all have responses back to the NTSB. And it’s my understanding that our initial responses will have a timeframe of about 90 days or so to get our initial response back once we received that final report.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And then just one other almost a housekeeping question, slide 13, footnote two, where you have no regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 at this point? Yet, it’s my understanding you have received approval to record regulatory assets in just about all your service territory. So the decision not to record any regulatory asset at this point based on COVID-19. Was your decision -- driven by the fact that you were able to control your expenses at this point that they were reduced enough that you didn’t feel a need to record any Reg assets? Is that a fair assessment of that?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. It’s pretty close. I mean, as you mentioned, Charles, we’ve got the orders that cover about 90% of our customer base right now. We’re evaluating the language in those orders. They were sufficiently broad and so we’re interpreting and how best to evaluate that order vis-à-vis our filings talking with our regulators and we anticipate by the end of the fiscal year that we will establish some form of regulatory asset. It’s just a matter of timing in this fiscal year when we establish that, but we are closely evaluating that right now and that’s been factored into the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Charles Fishman: Got it. Okay. So it’s more timing that you didn’t have anything in the first quarter. Got it. That’s all I have. Thank you.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Charles.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time.
Dan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. The recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through March 31, 2021. Have a good day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-12 10:00:00) =====

 I will now turn the call over to Chris Forsythe. 
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are happy that you can join us this morning. 
 Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share of $4.89, compared to diluted earnings per share of $4.35 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit, $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share that we recognized during the third fiscal quarter related to a legislative change in Kansas that reduced our state deferred tax rate. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 was $4.72. This represents the 18th consecutive year of rising earnings per share.
 In summarizing the year, the pandemic began to impact the economies of the states we serve at the end of our winter heating season. By that time, we had earned 70% of our distribution revenue for fiscal '20. Given the economic uncertainty at that time, we were conservative about the anticipated nonresidential load loss for the third and fourth quarter. And we plan to reduce O&M activities during the third and fourth quarters to keep our employees healthy and to align spending with anticipated revenues.
 Our residential load loss during the last 6 months in the fiscal year was less severe than we had originally anticipated. And we maintained our O&M spending in the back half of the fiscal year in line with the revised guidance we issued after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, our fiscal 2020 EPS came in at the higher end of our earnings guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73.
 Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose over 10% to $824 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.
 Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $140 million. We also experienced a $14 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended September 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.5%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.2% over the same period.
 We did experience a $6 million reduction in operating income, primarily due to a 13% decline in commercial consumption in our Distribution segment during the last 6 months of the year. We also experienced a $6 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities since March of this year.
 In our Pipeline and Storage segment, we experienced a net $14 million decrease through system revenue. Volumes declined 17% and prices declined 13% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Consolidated O&M expense for fiscal 2020 was flat compared to 2019, in line with our expectations. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense.
 Lower spending in our Distribution segment was offset by higher spending for system maintenance activities in our Pipeline and Storage segment, most of which was completed during the first half of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 14% to $1.94 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. With this spending, our team replaced approximately 845 miles in distribution and transmission pipe and 55,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate.
 In fiscal 2020, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $160 million in annualized operating income increases. And since the end of the fiscal year, we reached agreement with our regulators to implement an additional $106 million of annualized operating income during our fiscal 2021 first quarter.
 As of today, we have 3 filings pending seeking about $12.5 million. Slides 30 to 42 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal 2020, we successfully executed our long-term financing strategy while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and further enhancing our liquidity position. We completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. We fully satisfied our fiscal '20 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under the program, we issued 4.8 million shares under forward agreements for $523 million and settled 6.1 million shares for net proceeds of $624 million.
 As of September 30, we had about $345 million remaining under equity forward arrangements. This equity financing complemented the $800 million in long-term debt financing we issued last fall and the $200 million term loan we executed in April. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization was 60% as of September 30. Additionally, due in part of the additional -- addition of $700 million of new credit facility capacity, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.6 billion of liquidity, including cash held in escrow under equity forward arrangements. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal 2021. Details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.
 Looking forward, fiscal '21 will represent the tenth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution, transmission and storage systems. The fundamentals of our operating plan remain the same. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '25, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.70.
 From a revenue perspective, we have assumed no material changes to our residential revenue as a result of COVID-19. However, we continue to remain cautious about our nonresidential revenue due to the continued economic uncertainty and the fact that we are now heading into the winter heating season. Although it is difficult to precisely estimate the potential load loss that we might experience, we performed multiple sensitivity scenarios as we considered our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance.
 Slide 18 summarizes our key Distribution segment revenue attributes and provides EPS sensitivities for the full fiscal year for each 1% change in sales volumes by customer class. And as you're aware, the performance of our Pipeline and Storage segment is predominantly driven by APT. As a reminder, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to LDCs, including our Mid-Tex division, under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to a 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services.
 APT only keeps 25% of the difference between actual revenues earned from these activities and the approved $69 million benchmark in its straight design. Our fiscal '21 guidance reflects current market conditions for the small portion of APT's business.
 From an O&M perspective, we have assumed that we'll execute our normal O&M program as we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. These activities include enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, work to address PHMSA's new integrity management rules that became effective July 1, 2020, and continued record establishment and retention.
 Similar to fiscal '20, we do have some flexibility around the timing of this O&M spending, which could help us align spending with potential changes to revenue. As we continue to focus on safely operating our system, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '25. Additional details can be found on Slides 16 and 17.
 Fiscal '21 capital spending is expected to rise about 7.5% and is expected to range from $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Approximately 85% of the spending will be dedicated to safety and reliability spending, which will also reduce methane emissions from our system. Approximately 73% of the spending will be allocated to our Distribution segment. Over 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.
 Continued spending, persistent replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '25. As you can see on Slide 21, we anticipate capital spending to increase about 7% to 8% per year off of fiscal 2020 spend levels for a total of $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years. This should support rate base growth of about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $19 billion to $20 billion in fiscal '25, up from about $11 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, as you can see on Slide 22.
 Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our ongoing system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '25.
 In fiscal 2021, we anticipate completing filings from $195 million to $215 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2021 and 2022.
 Moving to Slide 24. In light of our financial performance of fiscal 2020, yesterday Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 148th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated dividend for fiscal 2021 is $2.50, an 8.7% increase over fiscal 2020. We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years. And we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% as it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a reasonable return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. 
 This 5-year plan also continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing.  Based upon our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to continue to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure, with the targeted equity to total capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 25. And consistent with prior year plans, our financing plan has fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2025.
 In October, we completed a $600 million 10-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 1.5%. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt, as of October 1, 2020, stands at 3.94%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years.
 From an equity perspective, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '20 will set us a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '21. We expect to raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal '21 through our ATM program.
 To recap, the execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends at 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2025.  And as you can see on Slide 26, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which will help us sustain this plan for the long-term.
 Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin? 
John Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy.
 Our success in fiscal 2020 reflects the talent and dedication of our 4,700 employees. I've said it before and I will say it again today that they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities themselves and their families healthy and safe.
 I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our state regulatory commissions, our many peer companies, our state gas associations as well as the American Gas Association for their assistance and support during these challenging times.
 Our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way forward. As I've shared previously, through the outstanding work of our risk management and compliance committee and our senior leadership team, all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees were well prepared when we transitioned to a digital work environment.
 As you can see in our fiscal year operating and financial performance, our team has proven their ability to execute at the highest levels in all facets of our business. 
 Our move to digital work environment in March provided opportunities for us to leverage new tools to virtually connect with one another. One of the areas I want to highlight today is technical training. To date, we have trained over 900 employees, utilizing a virtual format designed by our workforce development and curriculum design teams. This has created exciting possibilities for us as this training is a critical part of our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.
 We play a vital role in every community we serve through our safe delivery natural gas service. Also important is our time, our talent and our resources, invested in bringing out the best in our communities so they can thrive.
 For example, during September, that's Hunger Action Month, we joined forces with hundreds of local school districts, food banks and other essential organizations that provide breakfast, lunch, snacks and healthy meals that all children need to grow, develop and succeed. Additionally, we provided resources that help students read on level by third grade.
 Furthermore, during our annual week of giving in September, our employees generously pledged nearly $900,000 in donations to benefit No Kid Hungry, United Way and The Salvation Army. Atmos Energy will match our employee pledges to further support the important work these agencies do every day.
 We also donated $1 million to more than 100 local energy assistant agency and nonprofit organizations to help customers stay warm this winter or weatherize their homes.
 As Chris mentioned, over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion, with 88% of that capital spending focused on safety and reliability investments identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy that includes replacing industry-identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastic and cast iron. Our Atmos pipeline Texas investments, in addition to safety and reliability, will continue to focus on serving a growing demand, particularly in North Texas. And as Chris mentioned earlier, our Mid-Tex division had a 1.5% net customer growth this past year.
 As you can see on Slide 19, we anticipate our capital spending plan over the next 5 years will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of the remaining cast iron pipe in our system and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 100,000 and 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory between 20% to 25%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next 5 years.
 On the technology side, as part of our wireless operations network, we anticipate 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading at the end of fiscal year 2025. Additionally, through this network, we are testing the ability to wirelessly receive cathodic protection monitoring data from across our distribution and transmission systems.
 In addition to modernizing our systems, we have been focusing on other ways to further reduce our carbon footprint. We categorized our environmental focus into 5 areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers.
 For example, on our gas supply it's RNG. Today, as you've heard us say before, we transport approximately 5 Bcf across our system, which is about 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We have identified several opportunities to increase the amount of RNG on our system. For example, we have just signed an interconnect agreement with a renewables company for an additional level of RNG from 3 dairy facilities. Although it is too soon to commit to how much RNG can ultimately be transported on our system, we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop frameworks for commercial viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment.
 Additionally, under the category of facility, we have 13 leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED-certified facilities and have 4 additional LEED-certified facilities planned. Of these 13 LEED facilities, 4 are certified gold and 7 are certified silver.
 LEED is a globally recognized green building certification rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council that provides third-party verification of efficiency and emissions reductions. For example, our annual water use at these facilities has reduced 50% to 60%, and our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are reduced approximately 600 metric tons per year.
 In closing, the long-term fundamentals of our strategy remain the same. And as you just heard, our employees continue to execute at the highest levels and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Our strategy is supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions, and several of our markets continue to have a long, strong term growth potential, most notably in the DFW Metroplex, the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country.
 The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.
 We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll now take any questions that you may have. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. 
Insoo Kim: My first question is on your 2021 guidance. I appreciate the commentary you gave on the sensitivities on what could happen with COVID during these winter months. But as we think about the midpoint of that guidance, are you able to give us a little more specificity as to what's embedded in terms of any demand impact net? 
Christopher Forsythe: Insoo, this is Chris. Like I said earlier, we did a number of different sensitivities, and rather than debating it with individuals, we thought by putting the sensitivities out that you see in Slide 18 would provide folks with the data that they can do to make some assumptions around what they want to think about the nonresidential load loss. But as I said, we ran multiple scenarios, and we feel like our guidance is reflective of those various scenarios.
 I also do want to point out that we've assumed a full O&M program this year and to the extent that we need to pull levers a little bit to align spending with revenues as well as keeping our employees safe. That opportunity exists for us as well. 
Insoo Kim: Got it. And just on top of that, what markets are you seeing the greatest risk to demand as we enter into these -- into those winter months? 
Christopher Forsythe: I think when we looked at our markets, in the back half of the year, Louisiana, Mississippi are -- excuse me, Mid-Tex were 2 that saw most of our -- the commercial decline that I commented on earlier. But right now, towards the back half of the year, it wasn't nearly as severe as we anticipated. It certainly recovered as we moved along through the third and fourth quarters. And we always have to continue to watch and see. I think it's also going to be contingent upon how the buyer spreads, how states may respond to containing the spreads, protecting the citizenry and also balancing the needs of the economy. 
Insoo Kim: Understood. And then looking at the longer-term guidance, you guys have been so consistent historically and given the 6% to 8% EPS, achieving most of the times at the -- or even above the upper end of that. When we look at the 5-year CAGRs through 2025 off of the 2020 actuals, it does imply a CAGR that's around 6.5%, a little bit less than some of the CAGRs that we've been calculating in prior years. How much of this is you being more just conservative versus some law of large numbers kicking in in terms of how much CapEx you're able to do or the financing plans that you currently have in place? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I think there's an element of conservatism in our numbers this year, as I mentioned, because we're going to be cautious about what we're seeing around the nonresidential load loss as we go into the winter heating season. If you go back to the kind of midpoint of the guidance for fiscal '20, had we achieved that and then you kind of extrapolate that out, that would get you closer to 7%, I believe. 
Insoo Kim: Yes. Understood. And just one more. At what point do you think, and is this in consideration when you look over this new 5-year time frame in creating potentially a holdco structure to help you guys create additional financing capacity? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. The holding company structure, we get that question from time to time. We like the transparency that our current structure provides for a regulatory environment. It minimizes the questions that you get around what are you doing at the parent level versus at the operating level in terms of equity capitalization, debt financing, so on and so forth. We've seen instances where regulators have tried to kind of pierce that at operating company level and try to get to the parent level to impute a capitalization at the opco level. So we feel like having a transparent capital structure the way we do today, just takes one less question off the table, and we can remain focused on talking about what we're doing with the spending in terms of modernizing system to make it perform more safely, more reliably and more environmentally responsible. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. 
Stephen Byrd: Congrats on the continued very good results. I wanted to build on a couple of questions there that were just asked. Just over time, how do you think about the delta between rate base growth and EPS growth? I think you've had a fairly consistent approach there. I was just curious as you continue to get bigger. If there are any sort of changes to your thoughts around that delta between rate base and EPS growth? 
Christopher Forsythe: As we've talked about before, Stephen, that large delta largely reflects the financing plan that we've assumed over the next 5 years. And we certainly believe that -- certainly over the next 5 years that we can continue to operate financing the corporation in a balanced fashion using an improved mix of long-term debt and equity. And the strength of the balance sheet is important. As we saw earlier this year with the shot to the markets, the ability to access the commercial paper markets, we really didn't have much material impact as a result of the strength of that balance sheet. And it also gave us the opportunity to further enhance the liquidity by $700 million because we did have that equity capitalization in place. 
Stephen Byrd: Understood. That balance sheet -- [ conservative ] balance sheet certainly has been a nice asset for you all to have. Now that makes sense. I wanted to shift over to M&A, which is -- I know you all don't really need any kind of inorganic growth. You've got great organic growth, really more at a high level. When you think about the skills and the capabilities that you've developed over time and you think about sort of applying that skill set to others, do you often sort of see a gap in that skill set where you could add value? Are there certain sort of categories of value-add you could provide or is that not something you spend much time kind of thinking about in the context of sort of inorganic growth? 
John Akers: Well, Stephen, it's Kevin. Let me start with and take us back to, as Chris and I said earlier, over the next 5 years we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion. And you know our rate construct very well. Within 6 months, we start earning on 90% of that and 99% by the end of 12 months. So that's where we're going to continue to focus right there. That's our strength. We've proven that over the last decade or so that we can execute at that level. It's a very understandable story for our employees, for our investors and for our regulators to follow. And I think everybody is working hard now around the regulations at the state and federal level to meet compliance. So I think through our associations, through our peer group meetings and everything else, I think our industry is at the top of its game right now and its ability to operate and deliver safe reliable natural gas service every day. 
Stephen Byrd: Understood. Okay. And then maybe just lastly, I know this is not likely to be relevant anytime soon, but we do think longer-term about green hydrogen. And I was especially interested just given your geography, in some cases your proximity to sort of pure hydrogen infrastructure nearby, and I was just curious your latest thoughts on sort of the cost to be able to accommodate green hydrogen, what percentage could be blended. And I appreciate that green hydrogen is quite expensive compared to natural gas. I'm not really thinking in the near-term. But also beyond sort of what you could do with your own system, whether there might, in the future, be some potential to combine your capabilities with the capabilities of sort of pure hydrogen infrastructure nearby to create really a backbone that could allow for a larger conversion to green hydrogen and usage of your systems? So I know that's fairly broad, but was just curious your thoughts on that. 
John Akers: Sure. And as we've said before, too, we are certainly plugged into and watching all the projects that are coming online, particularly here those in the states. As you're aware, most of those are, what I would call, single-point source or other particular turbine or a particular smaller scale project here or there, not anything on a wide distribution or transmission level. We're also watching very closely what's going on in Europe around -- particularly in Germany right now. There are several projects on a little bit larger scale, if you will, of blending and delivering that hydrogen. So we're staying plugged into the American Gas Association through the Gas Technology Research Institute and other associations to continue to monitor those projects. So we can take a look at such things, as you just mentioned, what is the appropriate blending, right? How and where do you do that? What's the impact on the infrastructure, the steel of those systems and the burners on the end-use equipment, those sort of things. So we're plugged in. We're continuing to monitor that. And we'll continue to stay in touch with those groups, and as necessary, continue our evaluation of our systems and what that may look like for a longer-term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Richie Ciciarelli with Bank of America. 
Richard Ciciarelli: I just wanted to follow-up a bit on Stephen's question, if I could. You obviously have a robust CapEx plan in front of you. But there are a few players in the space looking to divest some LDC assets, some are adjacent to your service territory. And just given where your multiple is relative to those peers, it would seem like an acquisition to be quite accretive. So just curious how you guys are thinking about the strategic landscape? 
John Akers: Exactly, as I said before, we're focused on that $11 billion to $12 billion going back into our system, modernizing our system, both at the distribution, transmission and storage levels, if you will. And again, you look at that regulatory construct on the times we just talked about that coming back to us in rate recovery. It's hard for me to say that you could get that type of recovery through an acquisition. We've been part of several, as you know, over the years. And they are extremely difficult at times to integrate both from an operational perspective, from an employee perspective and a cultural perspective. And right now, we have shown a decades long ability to execute on this strategy. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on making sure we're investing in the right things, getting the right recovery for that and modernizing our system so we can be environmentally sound as we continue to go forward and tighten our system up for our customers, our communities and our investors. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Got it. That's very helpful, focus on the organic profile here. And then just separately on the equity needs remaining for 2021, I think you've executed on roughly $345 million in equity forwards. So is the remaining amount through the ATM program, is it roughly in the $270 million to $300 million range? 
Christopher Forsythe: That's a pretty good assumption. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Okay. And then just last one on the O&M front, I guess, in response to what you were talking about Insoo earlier on the levers there. Should we think about that basically that you can offset and keep O&M flat relative to this year, if sales figures don't come in where you expect? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I think we'll just have to see how the year unfolds, Richie. I mean first and foremost, we still have to maintain compliance throughout the entire system. And we don't want to achieve compliance just by barely achieving -- by barely making it, if you will. So we'll just have to continue to look at that in terms of -- we do have just general inflation as everybody does in some of our just general costs as they continue to go up. So we'll just continue to monitor that, see where the fiscal year takes us in terms of revenue, looking at the portfolio of O&M activities. And we'll -- to the extent that we need to adjust, we'll update at the appropriate time. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. 
Charles Fishman: Slide 19, where you -- 5,000 to 6,000 miles of pipe replacement over the next 5 years. Where will you stand at the end of 2025 as far as how many miles of pipe are left or how many years of that kind of pace goes on? What's the -- what are we looking at post 2025? 
John Akers: Charles, this is Kevin. We have a runway right now in steel service lines at about a 15- to 20-year rate. So you look at that, that will get us down about 5 years off of that. Like I said, they're about a 22% reduction. And then we've got about the same timeframe on industry identified. So we'll have a little over a decade or so left. And let's keep in mind, that's at today's regulation, right? And what I mean by that, rules are always updated on types of equipment, various materials. And in addition, we've now gotten into this past decade of the system modernization, where previous years under the old rate construct, if you will, people would stay out, invest at smaller levels and try and work back through O&M reductions to do that. That model has long since gone. You have got to continue to invest in your system to keep it modernized, to keep the equipment up and leverage technology when and where you can. So I think these are at the current regulations, at current identified materials, but also, you got to keep this other construct in mind of wanting to keep your system as up-to-date as possible, right? 
Charles Fishman: Okay. And then, Kevin, with that argument, I mean, I look at the average monthly bill slide on 26. And I realized you rolled it forward, now you're starting 2009, isn't as good as 2008, when it was much higher. I was just comparing them. But you do have significant increases. What you just told me, is that the argument you used to  municipalities you serve, the regulators? 
John Akers: Well, I don't know. I'd quite state it as an argument. I think it's our investment strategy. And again, I think when you look at the household bill there, that's the lowest bill in the household today for our customers. And you compare today's price that we have on the sheet and at $4.50 to $5.50 range, you're talking about equivalent of somewhere around $11, $12 gas, when you compare that to the equivalent electric side. So if you convert that over, you're looking at about $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09 on the electric side. So I think we're continuing to be affordable at this investment progress that we're making. We continue to do it on an annual basis. So we send the right signals there. And honestly, that paired with the  [ production and ] the basis and where prices sit today are certainly a help for us as well. 
Charles Fishman: Yes. Well, continuing on that affordability issue, we've seen some electrification mandates on the coast. I don't believe there's been anything in your service territories, correct me if I'm wrong, but is -- let me ask you this, how are your market share with respect to new construction? Are you maintaining your market share with respect to single-family and multifamily with respect to competing against an all-electric new home or new apartment? 
John Akers: Absolutely. You just heard us talk about the organic growth, particularly here in the Metroplex area, and in addition, the territories we serve in Middle Tennessee and around our Olathe, Kansas area continue to show good growth as well there. So our market share continues to be strong. And when you look at what the Metroplex and how it's continued to grow here, I think we've got a good long horizon of customers wanting and demanding our natural gas product, as you've seen from those percentage increases there.
 And as you said, we haven't seen that electrification discussion, that push yet. We continue to talk with our customers. We continue to survey our customers, and they like the value the product brings and at the price, as I said today, at the $4.50 to $5.50 range, that equates again to $0.10, $0.11 a kilowatt electric, right? And you show me somewhere where people are getting that today. So I think we continue to remain competitive and continue to have strong market share. 
Charles Fishman: I would think, Kevin, with the -- with respect to these electrification mandates, the amount of energy that you as a gas utility deliver on the coldest day, the electric utilities would be hard-pressed to come up with that. It's a huge increase in their capacity, is that -- isn't it correct? 
John Akers: Yes. You're exactly right. You've seen the challenges, particularly on the West Coast that, unfortunately, some of those folks are having during the peaks right now. So you draw parallels back to a winter period and trying to meet that demand, and those peak needs is going to be even more challenging. But as you've heard me probably say before, right now, the population of the U.S. is about 330 million to 335 million and due to head toward 360 million by 2030. That's adding at Texas 30-plus million people here in less than a decade. So where are you going to get that energy? Natural gas, as we just talked about, is abundant, it's affordable and it's reliable. So -- and as the fourth largest proven reserve country in the world, I don't know why we would continue to leverage that asset and find ways to continue to grow that when we're thinking about a diversified energy portfolio going forward. So I think you're spot on with that. And that's how we view it. We view it that the industry serves 70 million, 75 million customers today where we continue to grow with that. And we are in the right place with the right infrastructure today to continue to provide that reliable service. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. 
Christopher Forsythe: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December of 2020. Have a good day. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-08-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, Dan. 
Daniel Meziere: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. 
 Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. 
 As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin? 
John Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together. The safety of our employees, our customers and the safety of our communities remain our focus as we continue to deliver safe and reliable natural gas service. Today, over 95% of our employees continue to work remotely as we are doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus, following the CDC guidelines as well as following our safety protocols such as hand washing, practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings. As I've said before, we were early to transition to remote work and we will be very intentional about returning to our offices. We continue listening closely to the health experts and following the data as we go about our daily operations. 
 As I shared last quarter, through the outstanding work of our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, our senior leadership team and all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees, we were well prepared to transition every facet of our business to a remote work environment in mid-March. That level of preparation and agility served us well as we continued executing at the highest levels during the third fiscal quarter. For example, our customer service agents and service technicians continued providing exceptional customer service, as indicated by our customers rating their satisfaction with our agents and technicians at 98%. 
 Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as the percentage of electronic bills issued as of the end of the third quarter increased to 45%. And our electronic methods of payments received such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking increased to 76% of the payments received as of June 30. Through these innovative electronic bill delivery and payment channels, Atmos Energy and our customers are doing our part to conserve environmental resources. For example, on an annual basis, the use of this technology saves approximately 1,300 tons of wood, nearly 6 million pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, 7 million gallons of water and nearly 400,000 pounds of waste. During the quarter, we deployed mobile wallet, a unique bill delivery platform enabling customers to view and pay their bill and manage their Atmos Energy accounts from Apple Wallet or Google Pay. 
 I also want to highlight the great work of our Safety and Enterprise Services and Operations teams that they are doing in the area of damage prevention, especially given we are just 5 days away from National 811 Day. This work is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to safety and our proactive measures to help raise awareness about third-party excavation damage, which is one of the greatest threats to the safety of distribution systems. Our teams have implemented a damage prevention ambassador program. They've developed social media alerts and other public awareness campaigns, such as postponing nonessential digging during the COVID-19 pandemic. All these efforts support the year-to-date result of a damage rate that is less than the industry average. 
 Using our safety practices and protocols I mentioned earlier, we have continued executing our proven investment strategy and remain on track to meet our capital spending range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. A safely performing distribution and transmission pipeline system work that includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections. Our fiscal year-to-date consolidated capital spending grew 17% to $1.4 billion, with approximately 88% of our spending being directed towards safety and reliability, all to modernize our system. Finally, our financial position remains very strong. And at the end of June, our liquidity was almost $3 billion, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. 
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will turn shortly with a few closing remarks. Chris? 
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.96 compared to $0.68 in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, we reported diluted earnings per share of $4.37 compared to $3.88 in the prior year period. Results for the quarter and year-to-date periods included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to a change in our state deferred tax rate resulting from legislation that was passed by the Kansas Legislature in June to eliminate the assessment of state income taxes on regulated utilities operating in the state. As a result of the change in our state deferred tax rate, we reduced our deferred tax liability by $33 million during the fiscal third quarter. We established a $12 million regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes that will be returned to Kansas customers, and we recognize remaining $21 million as a onetime income tax benefit. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.79 and $4.2 year-to-date. 
 Consolidated operating income during the 9 months ended June 30 rose over 10% to $723 million. Rate increases in both our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability spending totaled $111 million. We also experienced a $10 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended June 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.6%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.3% over the same period. 
 The impact of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our year-to-date operating income as we are able to align our O&M spending with a decline in nonresidential customer consumption we experienced during the third quarter. Through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we earned approximately 85% of our distribution revenues. Additionally, residential revenues comprised approximately 60% of our distribution revenues during the second half of the year. These bills are at their lowest during this time. 
 Finally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas costs, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories the base charge represents the largest portion of a customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter. For the year-to-date period, we experienced a $7 million reduction in operating income due to lower sales and transportation volumes during the third quarter. We did not identify a meaningful change in residential consumption due to COVID. However, we did experience a 14% decline in nonresidential consumption. We also saw a $3 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities. Our nonresidential consumption decline was concentrated in our commercial customer class, which declined 18% during the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We experienced most of the volumetric decline in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana divisions. 
 During the quarter, we saw commercial consumption climb by as much as 30% compared to the 2-year historical average in certain of our states by mid-May as shelter-in-place orders in our service areas impacted their businesses. However, since that time, we have seen a steady improvement. Through mid-July, commercial customer usage was just 11% below the 2-year average over the same period. 
 Additionally, we experienced a 12% decline in transportation volumes during the third quarter, primarily due to slower economic activity in the Automotive and Metals sectors. These declines in operating income were offset by a $17 million decrease in O&M expense, primarily associated with employee costs for overtime; standby and other costs; lower travel and training costs; and the temporary deferral of pipeline maintenance activities. 
 In our Pipeline and Storage segment, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our Mid-Tex division and a few other LDCs under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to its 3 system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its straight design. 
 During the third quarter, we experienced a net $2.5 million decrease in transportation and other revenue in this segment. APT's quarter-over-quarter through-system volumes declined 19% and prices declined by 30% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Year-to-date, transportation and other revenue declined by less than $1 million. 
 Slides 6 and 7 provide additional details of period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. On the regulatory front, to date, we have implemented $123 million in annual operating income increases. Additionally, we received approval for the 4 Texas GRIP filings that we voluntarily delayed in March for $23 million. These filings will be implemented on September 1. Currently, we have $141 million of regulatory filings in progress, most of which are scheduled to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Details of these filings can be found on Slides 19 through 29. 
 And other regulatory matters, we have orders in 5 of our 8 states that address the impacts of COVID-19. These orders cover more than 85% of our distribution customers and APT. Generally, these orders allow us to defer net incremental expenses, including bad debt expense and in a few of our states, certain lost revenues due to COVID-19. We are still evaluating these orders. Therefore, we did not record any regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 as of June 30. Slide 14 summarizes these orders. 
 As of June 30, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. Our equity capitalization was 58.8%, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in liquidity, including $750 million in cash between our operating accounts and ATM net proceeds. 
 During the third quarter, we executed new forward sales arrangements for approximately 2.3 million shares with anticipated net proceeds of $234 million. Additionally, we sold approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. Through June 30, we had sold about 3.6 million shares for $359 million. And as of June 30, we had about $547 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. 
 Yesterday, we reaffirmed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73. We now have more clarity around how COVID has and continues to affect our business from a customer perspective and an operational perspective. Based on what we understand today, we now believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of the range. For the fourth quarter, we have assumed similar nonresidential consumption declines that we experienced in the third quarter as several of our states have slowed the pace of reopening their economies. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter O&M to trend similarly to what we experienced during the third quarter. Slides 15 and 16 provide additional details around our guidance. 
 Thanks for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. 
John Akers: Thank you, Chris. Community service is woven into the fabric of Atmos Energy's culture, we call Atmos Spirit. And our 4,800 employees take pride in fueling safe and thriving communities each and every day. During National Hospitality Week -- or Hospital Week, in May, we saluted our medical professionals’ heroic efforts by delivering more than 12,000 meals to health care heroes across our 8 state service area. In valuing our strong partnerships with local restaurant owners and chefs across our 1,400 communities, we celebrated Take-Out Tuesday, an initiative that brings support to local restaurants by offering all employees the opportunity to enjoy lunch from the favorite neighborhood restaurant. Along with these enterprise-wide efforts to lift each other up during these uncertain times, we are fueling safe and thriving communities in ways both large and small. By working with school districts, early childhood programs and nonprofits across our service area to improve the reading proficiency by third grade and to feed hungry children so they can learn and thrive. I'm truly inspired by the many ways our employees come together to give of their time and talent to further support those who need a helping hand. 
 As I said earlier, our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business. Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy; and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. 
 With that, I'll open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Richie Ciciarelli from Bank of America. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Just curious given some of the deterioration in volumes you've seen on the nonresidential side and, obviously, appreciate the confidence for the back half or the remainder of the year in 2020. But just curious how you're thinking of things beyond that in light of the COVID impacts? And just really considering the fact that you and then really all of your gas LDC peers haven't gotten to experience this through the more meaningful peak winter heating season? 
Christopher Forsythe: Well, Rich, that's a good question. With the fiscal year-end rapidly coming to a close, we're deep in our planning cycle right now and we're certainly evaluating what's going on in the economies in the 8 states that we serve. And so we're keeping a close eye on that. We're not ready to announce yet what assumptions we're going to put into the fiscal 2021 guidance. As you know, we'll roll that out here in the fall in November. But we are taking a look at that. We're also assessing operationally what we're going to be doing to keep our employees safe and the community safe, and we'll have a better picture and more information to provide in November. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Got it. And just a follow-up on that a little bit, if I can. Just given like the annual true-up mechanisms you have for your O&M efforts, is there any other offsets that you could pursue into next year if the economic recovery is a bit more prolonged? 
Christopher Forsythe: When you say offsets, I mean, it's primarily -- we just have to continue to see, first and foremost, what we can do in terms of work that can be performed and doing it in a way that we can keep our employees safe, keep our community safe. And as Kevin said at the top of the call, doing our part to minimize the spread of the virus in the community. So we, obviously, have compliance work that has to be completed on certain schedules and time lines, and we can't let that slip. But we will be evaluating things, but we do have a little bit of discretion in the event that we do need to align our O&M with any potential volumetric and revenue declines due to the pandemic. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Aga Zmigrodzka from UBS. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: How should we think about your equity needs for 2021? Is it fair to assume that with the updated forward equity agreements that will be sufficient or should we expect a larger equity offering? 
Christopher Forsythe: I think we've been pretty consistent now for the last year, 12 to 15 months that the ATM is our preferred method for raising equity. We've got our financing plan out there, and we intend to do -- execute that financing plan in a balanced fashion with both long-term debt and equity. And we'll seek to use the ATM to the best of our ability to meet those equity needs for fiscal 2021 and beyond. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: What has been an increase in bad debt? And how quickly you can recover those costs for the mechanism that you have in place? 
Christopher Forsythe: So far, it really hasn't materially impacted us, and there's a couple of things to keep in mind around bad debt and collections. First, in all of our service territories, moratoriums are still in place that -- or in most of our service territories to prohibit the disconnect or resumption of collection activities. We then need to evaluate what the tone is from the regulatory environment. What's the tone from just the community in terms of those types of activities. Once we do begin to collect or resume collection activities, one, that could be several months down the road. But then number two, we won't see the impact of really bad debt until well beyond the resumption of those activities because it takes a certain number of months for it to work through the process of collection before it ultimately gets written off. 
 So right now, as where we sit here today it hasn't had a material impact on our business for fiscal 2020. Certainly, a watcheye and that we're keeping an eye on for fiscal 2021. But we think it's going to be some time before we begin to see that -- those bad debts really begin to rise up. And then you have to work it through the regulatory process and because we do have the opportunity first to have an annual filing mechanism. And as I mentioned, we do have the reg asset orders in 5 of out of 8 states, which provides us another tool to address those types of costs. I think at this point, it's probably just a little bit too soon to tell when exactly we're going to see that rise in bad debt. And then number two, when it will ultimately be reflected in rates. 
John Akers: Yes. Aga, this is Kevin, I'll just follow-up a little bit on that. In addition, our customer service agents and our customer advocacy team that supports those agents have been for several months now reaching out to customers in all classes, residential, commercial and industrial, about different payment options that exist out there for them, LIHEAP, local health agencies those sort of things. And whether those were outbound calls, letters, some folks allow us to have their e-mail address, getting in contacting with it. That way, we've been very proactive in reaching out to customers that appear to be having a tough time paying their bill. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward and head towards this upcoming heating season. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: I have a last question. Could you please maybe discuss a little in more detail what are the components of lower O&M? What is short in nature and you could still benefit from that in 4Q? And how much of cost savings you're expecting going forward kind of more sustainable? 
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. 
John Akers: Yes, the type of work... 
Christopher Forsythe: Go ahead, Kevin, you start. 
John Akers: Well, I was going to talk about the components and things that we looked at that we could defer going into the period. I'll hand off to Chris to talk to you about the numbers specifically. But there's such things like this right-of-way encroachment clearing trees, overhang brush, those sort of things, cleanup around GIS data, record digitization, those sort of things. And where we're ahead on certain inspections on our systems right now. Those things that we can move out to a different period, not do away with, not cancel, but move to a different period. Those are the sort of O&M things that we have shifted during the last quarter to 2 quarters and are currently evaluating now what opportunities do we have maybe to pick back up some of that and what does that timing look like as we head that into the end of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year. Chris? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. I would just say to add to that too, as we are still working remotely. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are still seeing lower employee travel entertainment costs, some of the overtime and standby. Certainly into the third quarter, we expect that to be consistent as we move into the fourth quarter. And -- so again, it's basically items that are certainly within our control, items that we don't have to -- where there's -- it's not a compliance deadline related where we have a little discretion around the timing of that and in terms of actual dollars saved. Again, as we think about 2021, we'll provide a little bit more color around our O&M spending levels for '21 in November. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from in Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. 
Insoo Kim: A question on just demand trends that you're seeing on a more geographic basis. I know the bulk of your exposure is in Texas, but you do have exposure to a lot of different states. Just which jurisdictions are performing from a demand perspective, better than what you expected and which are a little bit more concerning? 
Christopher Forsythe: Well, as really the -- what we're seeing across the board, as I mentioned, Mid-Tex and Louisiana in the third quarter were probably the hardest hit from a volumetric perspective. And that was in that all in, in the 20% range. The other states range anywhere from 9% to 17%, 18%. And as I mentioned, too, we have seen a steady improvement since really the middle part of May, kind of when things seem to have bottomed out. So all in, when I talked about that 11% versus the 2 year historical average, most of our divisions now are kind of right in that range. You do see a little bit of weakness still, but again, it's improving in a bit in Mississippi and Louisiana. But overall, things continue to trend in a better way than what we were seeing in the first half of the third quarter. 
John Akers: Yes, Insoo, this is Kevin. The other thing I'd just add is if you go back in, as we did, as we're looking at these volumes, we also look at the unemployment rates. As some of our jurisdictions opened up their phased reopenings and moved into the second and third tiers of those, if you will, we've noticed slight improvements in the unemployment rates in just about every jurisdictions from an April Bureau of Labor Statistics average. If you look at those through the June numbers, almost every one of them has shown some slight improvement. We think that's reflected again back in those states reopenings, commercial, retail, some other businesses, industrials, opening back up, bringing folks back in and picking up some of the business there. So that was a good indicator for us as well. 
Insoo Kim: Great. In terms of cost contingencies, I think you spoke on it and a couple of people have asked the questions already. But given a little bit stronger-than-expected performance for this year, does it, all else being equal, give you a little bit more contingencies that you could utilize in 2021? 
Christopher Forsythe: Like I said earlier, yes, we're still evaluating and putting together our fiscal 2021 budget. We'll have to, obviously, see what's happening with our customer behavior, particularly on the nonresidential side and in the -- here in the fourth quarter before we make a final determination of what -- or how we align our O&M going into 2021. So we'll have more color on that in November. 
Insoo Kim: Got it. And finally, just on the technology side, I think you mentioned things like automated customer bill payments and whatnot. Whether it's that or other technological advancements you are making or plan to make on the horizon? Are -- what type of efficiencies could you realize from those type of -- that type of work? 
John Akers: Yes. I'll talk a little bit about that. And -- the more data, access to data and providing data in a sooner format, in a better format, a consumable format, more in real time, if you will, an example of that is our WMR network. We're now working with our vendor to have real-time cathodic protection pilots on our system. So now it's going on and having manual reads on our system. We can upload those through our network and get those readings off of our pipeline and our distribution system in real time. Now that again, not much from an efficiency standpoint, but it provides continuous monitoring of your system and allows you to identify where you might have a cathodic protection system down sooner rather than later. We continue to roll out our automated leak detection equipment as well. And you heard us talk before about our Locus Map technology that we are in the final stages of rolling out to some of our crews here in the Mid-Tex division, which allows us to gather construction, material information, geo location positions in real-time as we're at these sites and upload those right back into our compliance systems. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. 
Ryan Levine: What's the capacity resistance to handle hydrogen? And is that capacity different than the RNG capacity from a constraint standpoint? 
John Akers: Yes. Ryan, 2 separate things there. We know there's a lot of discussion here lately about hydrogen, particularly with some of the things that are going on in Europe right now. And I know some of the dual fuel companies are talking about projects at particular sites, a site-specific hydrogen utilization, if you will. So it's a much different look than if you think about some of the discussion of blending. That's not yet on the near-term horizon. There are studies going on through particular groups associations. GTI even has a group together that's studying opportunities around hydrogen at this point. So that to say, I think, it's early for us to think about, to your question, how does that fit into our current distribution system. There's a lot of things that need to be worked out from a material standpoint, a supply standpoint, a utilization standpoint at the customer premises. So, I think, that's further out for us. It is separate from RNG, whether it comes from landfill or it's captured through digesters. The only challenge there is the BTU content, the quality of the gas. But once you get over that hurdle, it blends right in with the rest of our stream that we're delivering to customers. And as we talked about before with you, we're doing about 5 to 6 Bcf a year of RNG across our system that we're moving, and we continue to look for those opportunities near our system today. 
Ryan Levine: And then to clarify some of the earlier questions, in terms of contingencies in place to the extent that COVID impacts extend into the winter months. Am I correct in hearing that the key tools that you're looking at are O&M cost management and potentially capital market activity or are there other opportunities that you can pursue in order to adapt to the market conditions? 
Christopher Forsythe: I think you hit it on the head. It's just the -- again, looking at the O&M, aligning that O&M with the revenues that we're expected to get going into the next fiscal year. We're certainly mindful of the capital markets opportunities as well. As you can see in our 10-Q, we have layered in some hedges for future financing activities going out for a few years now to help lock in or take advantage of some of the current interest rate environment. So those are a couple of opportunities as well. So I think those are 2 very good ones to keep an eye on, and that's certainly items that we are contemplating as we finalize our fiscal '21 plans. 
Ryan Levine: On the capital market activity, given your regulatory construct, would you look to cement those plans in the coming months or could they be phased in over a broader time period, if you were to... 
Christopher Forsythe: I am not sure I understand your question, Ryan. 
Ryan Levine: Would you need to refinance debt or raise equity into the calendar year-end given the regulatory constructs in different jurisdictions? Or can you be more patient, if that's an option that you wanted to pursue? 
Christopher Forsythe: I see. Yes. So really the financing needs of the corporation, they're outlined on the website. It's at $5 billion to $6 billion over the current 5-year planning window of 2020 through 2024. Obviously, we'll update that in the fall as well. And those financing needs are really driven just by the -- primarily by the cash flow needs of the Corp and the spending needs. So I think we'll evaluate the timing and the execution of the various tools that we have available to us from a financing perspective. But we -- and obviously, you can also see we've layered in hedges for the fall for an anticipated debt issuance. So that one is kind of forecasted already and is out there for all to see. 
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. 
Charles Fishman: I had a question on Slide 8, capital spending. Certainly, the 17% increase is terrific. You say you're on target. I guess, I happen to be in the Dallas area over the July 4 weekend and the construction along I-75 is amazing. And I was just wondering if you could provide some color. Is your new construction connections, which, I believe, is not part of the 88% safety and reliability, is that on target as well? Has that been impacted by COVID-19, at least with respect to your plan? And, obviously, my viewing is just a small piece of all your jurisdictions. I wonder if you can maybe provide some color on new construction in your other jurisdictions because, obviously, you don't have as much control over that as you do on the safety and reliability spend. 
John Akers: Right. I'll start out with a little color on the North Texas area there as you talked about and then on some of our other jurisdictions. But going into COVID and particularly the first month, 1.5 months, we did see a bit of a slowdown of dip, if you will, in the housing market, in particular, but they quickly rebounded. We're doing virtual tours of homes. The inventory of available homes on the market quickly tightened up. And we're seeing a lot of individuals, as you know, with the low interest rate, moving to the new construction. So we certainly see that pick up as things started to open back up and we got into these phased reopenings. 
 We continue to see good growth in that market here in the North Texas area. I think as we said last year, we're experiencing somewhere around 1.5 to 1.6 net customer growth on the system, particularly all -- most of that is going to be here in the Metroplex area. So we've continued to see a little bit of a lull, but now a pickup in that residential market. And in other areas, not to quite that scale, but outside of Nashville in our Franklin service territory, we continue to see some good residential growth there as well and then outside of our Kansas City location and Olathe that area, we do continue to see some residential growth as well. All taking advantage of, we believe, as we keep a handle on, have conversations with builders, developers and realtors association, trying to take advantage of this low interest rate environment. 
Charles Fishman: So as we look -- as we sit here today, 2021, do you expect customer growth to still be around the 1.5%? 
John Akers: Yes. I think that's a good indication here -- as we, again, talk to builders and developers, they're continuing to develop properties. They're continuing to have people come in. Right now, we are continuing to see strong activity in that area. And yes... 
Charles Fishman: That's all I had. 
Christopher Forsythe: I was just going to say the other piece that's driving it, too, is that same home sales. Folks that already have homes are staying in their homes for obvious reasons. And so the folks that are looking to get out of the apartment environment or maybe out of an urban downtown environment are now flocking into that new home and growth markets. So it's -- that's just another piece that's driving some of that the customer growth. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. 
Peter Giannuzzi: This is actually Peter on for Jeremy. I just have a quick -- I just have a quick question on the EPS sensitivities, the update that you gave here. Is the change each quarter or at least what we have strictly related to historical demand for each customer class or are there other factors that you kind of think about when you give these? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. So on Slide 13, we do have the EPS sensitivity that we've updated that for the fourth quarter. So you can see again, on the bottom 1/3 or bottom half of the page, the revenue by customer class, residential on down through the nonresidential and then the sensitivities to the right. So that's basically the 1% change relative in the customer volumes in the fourth quarter and kind of how that moves it for us. So in terms of how that compares to the prior year, I mean, that's just a 1% change for each of those customer classes produces that EPS sensitivity. 
Peter Giannuzzi: Right. Okay. And so that's for the last quarter kind of right on a stand-alone basis. And then just to clarify, the one -- the sensitivity you provided at your last call, that was for just the back half or that was for on a full year basis? 
Christopher Forsythe: That was for the back half of the fiscal year. So we'll probably update this slide again in November to provide a better impact or what that 1% looks like on a full fiscal year basis here in November. 
Peter Giannuzzi: Okay. And then, I guess, just last one here. I guess, looking at the sensitivities, obviously, lower for each class compared to what you showed for the back half last quarter. But should we think about the net impact kind of being the same as we see recovery across all classes where residential still kind of offsets the same amount of, I guess, drag from the other classes like -- on a relative basis, kind of like what we saw in 3Q? 
Christopher Forsythe: Well, a couple of comments there. I mean, the impacts are smaller here in the fourth quarter because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the first half of the third quarter, you're still seeing some volumetric influence across all customer classes and now beginning at the latter half of May and June, all the way to December, we're primarily into the base charge component only of the bill given the summer months. So I mean what remains to be seen exactly how customers are going to behave. Like I said, we have seen modest improvement since the lows have been made. That's something we're watching very closely. And it's for that reason, we don't have -- it's hard for us to predict as we look out, particularly as some of our reopenings have slowed a little bit. So that's why we provided the sensitivities in 13 for you to make that assessment. 
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. 
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through November 12, 2020. Have a good day. 
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and everyone, you may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-05-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President and Treasurer for Atmos Energy. Thank you. You may begin. 
Daniel Meziere: Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.
 As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.
 Our first speaker is Kevin Akers, President and CEO of Atmos Energy. Kevin? 
John Akers: Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together.
 I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our everyday heroes, those who are helping our country battle this pandemic: our first responders, health care workers, law enforcement officials, grocery store employees, truck drivers delivering our nation's supplies, those serving in our branches of the military and all essential services providers working to support our communities. Thank you for what you are doing to help all of us. We are eternally grateful.
 I also want to thank our 4,800 Atmos Energy everyday heroes as they continue to provide our customers safe and reliable natural gas service. I'm extremely proud of their dedication and commitment to keeping our 3.1 million customers of 1,400 communities and themselves healthy and safe. Atmos Energy's commitment to safety paired with our culture have led us during unique times, and this will be no different.
 In early February, our Chief Information Officer led a team effort to assess and test our company-wide remote work capabilities, including our 2 customer support centers, gas supply, our 2 gas control centers, our shared service functions and over 200 operational service centers across our 8-state service territory. Through their efforts, by mid-March when local and state governments started issuing shelter-in-place orders, we were ready to transition every facet of our business to a fully remote work environment. Today, we have over 95% of our employees working remotely and continuing to perform at the highest levels.
 As an example of their outstanding effort, for the month of April, our customer service agent satisfaction scores were 97.6%, and our service technician satisfaction scores were 97.4%. Truly outstanding work by that team.
 In addition, our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, along with senior leaders from across the company, focused on several operational scenario planning exercises in early March. These exercises, based on current world and U.S. situations, were focused on maintaining the safety of our customers, communities and employees as we continue to provide reliable natural gas service. Specific areas of focus were emergency response, system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating, system inspections as well as the ability to remotely train employees.
 Besides working remotely, you will see employees doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus by practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings while working in our communities or working in smaller construction crews. We believe the above implemented practices for our employees and our contractors, along with using CDC guidelines to design safety protocols for things such as self temperature and system screening, have us positioned to continue providing safe and reliable natural gas service.
 Using the safety practices and protocols mentioned above under shelter-in-place orders, we have been able to safely perform distribution and transmission pipeline system work. This work includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.
 In preparing our work plans, practices and protocols, we worked with our regulatory agencies, local and state officials, emergency management, the American Gas Association and industry peers across our service territory. We greatly appreciate their leadership and ongoing support as we all work together for the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities.
 Our culture atmosphere has guided us in the past, is guiding us during this challenging time and will continue to guide us into the future as we look to be at our best, bring out the best in others and make a difference. Making a difference for local food banks and communities across our 8 states to help keep meals on tables through our donation of $1.5 million. Being at our best, Atmos Energy employees partnered with many nonprofit agencies, schools, hospitals throughout our service territory to fill lunch bags for children, provide meals for our health care heroes and first responders or by donating much-needed plasma. Making a difference for our customers by temporarily suspending disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment and certain reconnect fees during these challenging times so customers continue to have safe and reliable natural gas service for heat, water heat and cooking.
 I'm extremely proud of our 4,800 employees in how their atmosphere has shined so brightly upon our neighbors and our communities. Also making a difference, we closely work with our regulators to develop solutions to the mutual benefit of our customers in the company. We have elected to defer implementation of new rates for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas from our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1 of this year.
 Additionally, we have received regulatory orders in 4 states covering approximately 80% of our customers to defer any COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. In April, we executed $900 million in new financing arrangements to further solidify our liquidity. As of April 30, our liquidity was $2.9 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong.
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will return shortly with a few closing remarks. 
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2020 second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.95 compared to $1.82 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, diluted earnings per share were $3.42 compared with $3.21 per diluted share in the prior year period.
 As Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, mitigation efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 began to impact our service territories during the last 2 weeks of March. Therefore, we did not experience a material impact from COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income during the 6 months ended March 31 rose over 9% to $584 million.
 I will touch on a few of the highlights now. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $83 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed incremental $8.5 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.5% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our 8-state footprint.
 Consolidated O&M increased $12 million or 4.2% primarily driven by higher employee and information technology costs and pipeline and maintenance activities. The period-over-period increase also reflects well integrity work that incurred during our first fiscal quarter.
 Slides 5 and 6 provide additional details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. Consolidated capital spending for the 6-month period grew 28% to $995 million, with 87% directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. Because of our designation as an essential service provider and the measures we have taken to protect our employees and contractors, we still believe our fiscal 2020 capital spending will range between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion.
 Our fiscal second quarter is the busiest regulatory filing period of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have implemented $58 million of annualized operating regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $215 million in progress. Of this amount, we currently anticipate to implement approximately $100 million in annualized regulatory outcomes by the end of the fiscal year. Slides 21 to 31 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 20 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.
 Maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and a strong liquidity position continues to be one of our primary financial objectives, and it has served us well during this uncertain time. During the second quarter, we filed a $4 billion shelf registration statement and we filed a new $1 billion ATM program.
 Also in the second quarter, we executed new forward sales agreements for approximately 1.6 million shares with anticipated proceeds of $180 million as of March 31, we had about $419 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. With this activity, we have priced all of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2020 and a portion of fiscal 2021.
 Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet supports our Tier 1 commercial paper rating. As a result, we have been able to maintain reasonable access to the commercial paper markets. As of March 31, we had about $200 million in outstanding commercial paper. At the end of the second quarter, our equity capitalization was 58.2%, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements.
 Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, we took action in April to increase our liquidity to approximately $2.9 billion. We accomplished this through the execution of a $200 million 2-year term loan and 3 new 364-day credit facilities totaling $700 million. The net proceeds from the term loan were used to repay all outstanding commercial paper backstopped by our primary $1.5 billion credit facility.
 This facility is fully available and in place through September 2023. Additional details regarding our liquidity can found on Slide 10. We believe this liquidity position, the strength of our balance sheet and $3 billion available under our shelf registration statement gives us the financial flexibility to support our operations as we move forward.
 Looking towards the second half of the fiscal year, we are certainly aware that the economies of the service areas we serve have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent economic data reflects rising unemployment in each of our states. However, based on what we know today, we still expect earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.73.
 We considered a number of factors in our evaluation. First, our winter heating season is complete. We typically earn approximately 70% of our distribution revenues during the first half of our fiscal year. In our distribution segment, although we are not fully decoupled, we believe there are factors that mitigate revenue risk for this segment. These factors are summarized on Slide 14.
 Residential revenues comprise approximately 60% of the segment's revenues during the second half of the fiscal year and residential builds were at their lowest during this time. Additionally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas cost, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories, the base charge represents the largest portion of the customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter.
 We typically experience a decline in volumes during April. However, given that April is a shoulder month, it is difficult for us to identify if changes in volumes are weather related or representative of underlying economic activity. Therefore, we have provided some sensitivity information by customer class on Slide 14.
 Additionally, the rate design and various annual filing mechanisms in our distribution segment support our ability to recover our costs timely. Slide 15 summarizes various aspects of rate design by state. Most of these mechanisms are well understood by you. However, I wanted to highlight that since March 31, our regulators in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia had issued orders to defer COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense, into a regulatory asset for consideration for future recovery. These orders cover approximately 80% of our customers.
 Finally, as Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas, including the City of Dallas, we have voluntarily delayed implementation of new rates that were scheduled to go into effect during our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1. These delayed implementations will not have a material impact to our fiscal 2020 financial performance due to the time of year if these rates would have been implemented.
 In our pipeline and storage segment, revenues are earned primarily through demand fees. As you're aware, performance of the segment is predominantly driven by APT. Over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our North Texas distribution company and a few other LDCs under a straight, fixed, variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relate to its 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its rate design. And the COVID-19 regulatory asset order issued by the Texas Railroad Commission also applies to APT.
 Finally, from an O&M perspective, we have deferred some discretionary spending to future periods as we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. Slides 17 and 18 provide additional details around our guidance.
 Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. 
John Akers: As you can see, we have a robust risk management process that has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way through. As you just heard, we have continued to execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business.
 Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. And as we stated earlier, we have continued our system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.
 Our leadership team and all 4,800 employees were prepared to operate in this environment as it developed in our service areas and have continued to adjust and adapt as new information or local and state orders were issued. We were early to transition to remote work, and we will be very intentional about reopening our offices.
 As you have heard, orders to shelter in place began in mid-March with others being issued in April across our service territory. Therefore, we have not yet seen material impacts to our business. Additionally, 6 of our 8 states have now lifted their shelter-in-place orders and have begun phased reopening plans.
 Over the next quarter, we anticipate having further information and results available to assess any operational or financial impact. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.
 With that, we'll open up for questions. Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: Could you please provide more color on the reaffirmed CapEx range? Which factors could potentially push you to the lower end of the range? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. With respect to the CapEx range, we're $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Again, we are an essential service provider. Our crews are working using -- practicing safe social distances. So to the extent that a regulatory authority were to come in and change our designation as an essential service provider, ask us to stop or slow down for whatever reason as they navigate through the pandemic, that could be a factor that could drive us towards the lower end of that range. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of COVID-19? You provided some sensitivities. What is the impact that you're actually including in your 2020 guidance? 
Christopher Forsythe: Well, as I said, April is a shoulder month for us. We have -- we've certainly modeled some potential outcomes. But we really can't see yet what is driving the decline in volumes that we typically see in April, if it's seasonality or if it's a true underlying economic activity. So we put those sensitivities out there for everyone to use in their modeling and in their evaluation. 
Aga Zmigrodzka: And my last question is have you seen any delays from PUCs on your pending or expected filings? 
Christopher Forsythe: No, we haven't. We -- as I mentioned, we have $215 million in progress at this point in time. This is our busiest filing period of the year. A large number of those filings were filed right at the end of March or the first part of April, and we are working through the discovery process with our intervenors in due course.
 Everyone's working really well from home. So information is flowing back and forth. For a large number, about roughly $100 million of that filing, and exclusive of $215 million, is not scheduled to be implemented until October 1. And those are our Texas RRM filings. So we're very early in the process. We have another $15 million or so that was filed for Louisiana. That's scheduled to be implemented on July 1. And at this time, we have no indication of any delays. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richie Ciciarelli with Bank of America. 
Richard Ciciarelli: I hope everyone's staying safe and healthy out there. I appreciate you guys taking my question. Yes. Just had a question on the O&M guidance, reduced -- essentially flat outlook for 2020. Is this principally in response to COVID? And can you kind of discuss where these cost cuts are coming from? And how you're thinking about O&M over the forecast period? 
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. Yes, a lot of it is COVID related. We're focused on the health and safety of our employees. So to the extent that we don't have to perform compliance-related work in order to keep those employees out of the community or limit our actual exposure to it, we've got employees in the community, we decided to pull back on some of that discretionary O&M.
 So that's typical work like encroachment, right of way maintenance. We've done a really good job over the years by keeping up with a lot of that work. So they gave us some flexibility to defer that to future periods and other types of work, be it noncompliance-related in-line inspection and other noncompliance-related pipeline maintenance activity.
 So we see the guidance range on Page 18 for O&M. As you noted, it is flat to flattish to last year. And we'll just continue to monitor our O&M and really the entire organizational -- the operations of the organization as we move through the next 6 months. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Got it. That's very helpful. And you're still -- for long-term forecast, are you still expecting the 2.5% to 3%? Or is it something less than that now? 
Christopher Forsythe: At this point, given what we know, we're holding to the 2.5% to 3.5%. Again, we're going to come through the pandemic. And at some point, this work that we're deferring will have to be completed. So for now, we're holding to that. 
Richard Ciciarelli: Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And sorry if I missed it, but did you explicitly reaffirm your 2020 guidance? I know you said it was unchanged. But just curious if you explicitly reaffirmed it. Because I mean, it seems like minimal sales impact, as best as we can tell, you have all the regulatory mechanisms in place. I just wanted to make sure we understand you correctly here on 2020. 
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. Sure. I mean you can see it in our earnings release. It's in the titling. It says it's reaffirmed. And again, based on what we know today, we believe the range of $4.58 to $4.73 is appropriate. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. 
Charles Fishman: You have a unique regulatory framework in Texas on the distribution with the municipalities and the Railroad Commission. When you made the statement, Kevin, that -- with respect to the treatment of the asset deferral with respect to any COVID-19-related cost, is that similar to how the state commissions work and how that's going to be treated? Or is there any unique factors just because of the different regulatory framework you have in Texas? 
John Akers: No, I don't think there's any uniqueness to it. It works very similar as it does in the other jurisdictions. We'll incur those costs and in our next filing, we'll take those under consideration and review. So we're just like our other jurisdictions. 
Charles Fishman: So the municipalities actually gave you that order? Or was that done at the Railroad Commission? How did that work? 
John Akers: That was through the Railroad Commission that... 
Charles Fishman: Okay. Which is the ultimate regulator for the distribution? 
John Akers: That is correct. 
Charles Fishman: Okay. And then I heard you talk about 2020 CapEx. Are you also reaffirming, though, the $10 billion to $11 billion of CapEx between 2020 and 2024? 
John Akers: As we said, well, we've been able to continue our capital work through this program designated as an essential service provider. We anticipate continuing to be able to do that and at this point, don't see anything out there that would defer our capital strategy that we have in place right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. 
Ryan Levine: Would you be able to comment on what you're seeing in the labor market within your service territory and how that impacts any of your hiring or spending programs? 
Christopher Forsythe: Sure. I mentioned that we are -- go ahead, Kevin. 
John Akers: Well, right now, as Chris and I said in our opening remarks, we've been able to do the work that we need to get done to maintain the safety and reliability of our system, both on the distribution and transmission side and coupled with our employees and our contract employees, believe we have the appropriate staff levels at this point. There are some impacts, as you would imagine, from the oil fields at this point on the unemployment numbers. But we believe we are fully staffed and operational, continue to do the things we need to do on a daily basis. 
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of just practical implementation of some of your spending programs, you mentioned that you practice -- or additional social distancing in order to implementing the projects. I mean what does that mean in practice? Does that mean you need to -- takes a little longer to do the jobs? Or you just -- can you kind of just delineate what the practical implications are? 
John Akers: Yes. For example, on our main replacement, we would have a larger crew that would go out and work on the main and service lines at the same time. What we've chosen to do now is break those into smaller crews, wearing their face masks, social distancing, driving separate vehicles to the project at some times and then working as best they can remotely from each other until they have to get in the ditch and inspect. And then we have a separate crew that will come in later and work on the service line. So we don't have all those employees up one side at one time. 
Ryan Levine: Does that drive any changes in the cost profile? Or what are the financial implications of this new social distancing? 
John Akers: No, it does not affect that costing at all. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. 
Insoo Kim: My first question is regarding just your language and around the guidance and your ability to hit that range. You gave a lot of details, which definitely I appreciate. But just coming, when I think about how you guys are situated on your business profile and your point that the bulk of the distribution revenues have already been earned through March as well as all the regulatory mechanisms, what concerns do you have, I guess, besides the -- just the length of how long we're going to be in this current situation that you think could potentially impact you to the downside? Are you seeing some economic deterioration already in some of your jurisdictions as a result of COVID? 
John Akers: Can you restate that second part there? I think you broke up a little bit, your last part. 
Insoo Kim: I was just asking, are you seeing any initial signs of economic deterioration in any of your jurisdictions? 
John Akers: Not at this point. As we said, the -- our first full month of operation was April. Those bills are just now going out. And we'll have some more information as those come through in the next few weeks on into -- later into May and first part of June. But as we have said, with these shelter-in-place orders across our states, a lot of businesses have been able to continue to operate. We've seen construction continue to go on. We've seen a lot of road work continue to go on. Some of the restaurants have continued to be open without the in-room dining but have continued to provide pickup and carry out-type service. So we've seen a lot of activity even though there's some shelter in place. And we're just waiting to see how that plans out as we go through these phased reopenings and get a look at some of those bills to see if those loads picked up or maintained what they normally would have been. 
Insoo Kim: Understood. And then regarding your plant O&M guidance for the year, does that -- I assume that's excluding the O&M costs that are related to COVID-19 in jurisdictions that you're allowed to defer from the income statement? 
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. It does. And to this point, we're closing out the books for April right now. So we'll have a clearer look here in the coming days as what that spend is. But to your point, anything that is COVID-related or incremental over and above our run rates would be considered for regulatory asset treatment. 
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. 
Daniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through August 6. Have a good day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-02-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy. Jennifer, please go ahead.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 22 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Our 2020 fiscal year is off to a solid start. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $179 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. We reported growth in both our distribution and pipeline and storage businesses, driven by continued customer growth and distribution and rate recovery in both segments. Consolidated operating income rose 7% to $253 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Operating income for our distribution business rose 6.4% to $180 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided incremental $27 million, primarily in our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions. Customer growth contributed incremental $4 million, as we have continued to benefit from the strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.4% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our eight-state footprint. Consumption declined modestly due to colder weather last year before weather normalization mechanisms went into effect and O&M expenses increased $8.6 million associated with the distribution integrity management work and higher employee-related costs. Operating income for the pipeline and storage business grew 8% to $73 million, primarily driven by a $13.7 million increase due to the implementation of new rates from our 2019 GRIP filing, partially offset by a $5 million increase in O&M, related to the timing of well integrity work. Consolidated capital spending grew 27% to $529 million, with 86% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. We remain on track to invest between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion this fiscal year. We have a well-established regulatory strategy, focused on reducing lag. In fiscal 2020, we expect to begin earning a return on 90% of our spending within six months of the test period end. Year-to-date, we have implemented $59 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and currently we have about $21 million in progress. Slides 13 to 18 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 19 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our capital expenditure program, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is critical to the successful execution of our strategic plan. During the first quarter, we received $1.1 billion in net proceeds from long-term financing activities. In October, we issued $3 million of 10-year notes and $500 million of 30-year notes at an all-in effective rate of 3.15%. As a result, we were able to reduce our weighted average cost of debt to 4.32%. Our customers continue to benefit from these historically low rates. Additionally, we increased our weighted average maturities to 22 years and do not have a material maturity until 2027. From an equity perspective, we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $259 million in net proceeds and we executed new forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 340,000 shares, with an anticipated net proceeds of approximately $37 million. As of December 31, we had about $240 million remaining under equity forward arrangements that must be utilized by the end of our fiscal year. We continue to believe that we can satisfy our fiscal 2020 needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.6% as of December 31 and we finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year financial plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. In December, Moody's upgraded our long-term debt rating to A1 with a stable outlook and S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide seven through 10. Our first quarter performance leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. As a result, yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his closing remarks.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we are off to a good start to the year, as we remain on track to meet our capital spending goals and earnings growth targets. From an operational perspective, we remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission storage systems as well. We are continuing our investments in people, process and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale safely and efficiently, while investing $10 billion to $11 billion over the next five years. I would like to highlight one of our larger investments, the Bethel Salt Dome project, which we began in fiscal 2019 and is estimated to be completed in 2025. As we've discussed previously, we plan to invest between $100 million and $120 million to develop a third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This project will enable us to safely perform regulatory compliance work on our two existing caverns and meet the growing demand in the North Texas market. The construction of the power and leaching facilities, have been completed and we began the leaching process in mid-December. The leaching process is estimated to take between 25 and 30 months and we anticipate finishing our required compliance work on all three caverns and have them in service by late 2025. Natural gas is an important driver of economic growth in this country and we have seen our industrial business grow in our Kentucky mid states and Mississippi divisions, particularly in the automotive manufacturing sector and in the spirits industry. Over the last few quarters, clean, efficient and affordable natural gas lead transport has supported the expansion of existing facilities and fueled new industrial project development. Once these expansion projects fully come online, over the next few years, we expect to deliver an additional two Bcf annually to these customers. Additionally, we continue to expand deliveries to CNG customers with the addition of a new customer in Colorado. As a result, our customer expects to replace nearly 90,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually. During the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting capabilities. In December, we launched a Corporate Responsibility section on our website to provide greater disclosure of our focus on safety and long-term sustainability and to highlight how we are working to meet the needs of our various stakeholders. We also published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as an updated methane emissions report, both of which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section under Reports. The continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems will help ensure all residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers continue to have access to reliable, affordable, abundant and efficient natural gas. To support this effort, last week, we were pleased to announce that we joined the One Future coalition, a voluntary alliance of leading companies across the natural gas supply chain, focused on technology and policy to drive continued improvement in reduction of methane emissions. We look forward to working with One Future as we move toward achieving our target of a 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2035. In closing, I want to thank our 4,800 employees who are dedicated every day to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work. We appreciate your time this morning and now we will take any questions you may have.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Richard Ciciarelli from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Richard Ciciarelli: Hey good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?
Kevin Akers: Yes, good morning Richie. How are you doing?
Richard Ciciarelli: Doing well. I just had a question on the O&M profile. It seems like it was a sizable uptick this year. And I appreciate some of that was for like the increased employees due to the faster growth but just curious like how you intend to shape the O&M curve through the outlook given like the 2% to 3% growth that you're managing towards?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Some of that -- a couple of things. We got the 2% to 3% -- 2.5% to 3.5% that's baked into our five-year plan through 2024. We had already -- and that's a CAGR over that five-year period. So, we had already anticipated as you noted an uptick in O&M this year as a result of the additional hiring that we had obviously in the first quarter. As you try to turn that out over four quarters that can be a little bit difficult. We did have some timing particularly in our pipeline and storage segment around some well integrity work that was kind of accelerated more into the first quarter. So, when we look at the O&M guidance that we published for fiscal 2020, we feel like we are still on track to achieve that at this point in time.
Richard Ciciarelli: All right. It makes a lot of sense. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Insoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is at the pipeline segment. When you look at the year-over-year decrease in transportation volumes how does that magnitude compare versus your expectations? I know you've expected some of that given the online of the Gulf Coast Express pipeline and whatnot, but how does that magnitude like fare versus your expectation? And how does that place you in terms of the expected growth of the segment for this year?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, it's pretty much in line with our expectations. And honestly, we saw volumes pick up just a little bit versus what we expected but pricing was a little bit down. So, net-net we were in line with expectations. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor the market conditions. You're very well aware of the supply and demand dynamics are ongoing in the Permian Basin and we'll just keep an eye on that. But at this point we still think that our net income as well as our guidance that we have out there is still good.
Insoo Kim: Understood. And second Kevin I know you touched upon this in your prepared remarks but with ESG and electrification of the grid story having taken hold recently in our market, so could you share your thoughts a little bit more on your view of the gas that plays a role in the future of the U.S. energy grid? And also how do you see that potential shift creating maybe a secular decline in existing or new gas usage on the customer base?
Kevin Akers: Yes. I appreciate your question. First of all, let me say that I'm proud to be in the natural gas business particularly this morning as we sit here in Dallas, the wind-chill is in the low 20, so our customers are receiving safe reliable heating for their home and have hot showers as well. So, we're very, very proud of our product and what we're able to do from a reliability and efficiency standpoint. But the way we see it as you look at the population in U.S. today about 335 million or so headed towards 360 million by 2030, that's like adding a Texas to the population in about a 10-year period with growth at about 2.5 million people or so a year there. That's going to require a diversified energy portfolio and we see natural gas as a vital part of that energy solution as we move forward. As we said before, it's efficient, it's affordable, it's abundant, it's reliable, and it's flexible. There's not another fuel that's flexible like it to meet this growing demand of energy that's going to be required by 2030. You can compress, it you can decompress it, you can transport it, you can liquefy it, you can store it below ground. There's nothing like it that's reliable and abundant today that's out there. And as a natural gas distribution utility having interstate transmission assets, we embraced our role operating responsibly and being good stewards of our environment. As you've heard us say before, we're working to tighten up our system with our modernization of our infrastructure and we continue to deploy technology across our system, both in a monitoring capability and equipment capability to make sure we are operating as responsibly and as efficiently as possible. And we'll continue to work with our partners both upstream as you saw with our joining of ONE Future to measure that we're getting the best available practices that are going on in the industry today to look at and maybe incorporate into our business, as well as partner with groups like AGA and GTI to not only tell our story, but to also look at what technology is available from a burner tip perspective or technology perspective whether that's carbon capture or carbon storage. So as we see it we see a continued growth of natural gas. It plays a viable role in the energy future now -- in the energy portfolio now and well into the future trying to meet that energy demand by 2030. Again there's nothing like it that's as flexible reliable and as efficient. So as we talked about in my script with industrial demand out there, we're continuing to see good expansion of industrial load, good new growth on the industrial and commercial side as well. And then in addition you heard Chris mention the 1.2% to 1.4 % net growth on the residential side, as well in our market areas. So both residential through the industrial markets we continue to see good growth area.
Insoo Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research. Your line is now live.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. I just want to make sure I understand this. On the pipeline and storage you talked last quarter about the new pipeline coming on, competitor pipeline impacting operating income. And obviously, we didn't see that in the last quarter. It was pretty darn good, but then you made the statement that it's on-track. I mean do you anticipate pipeline and storage being roughly flattish this year versus last year? Or when you say on track if you could provide a little more color what that might be?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. Yes. Charles this is Chris. A couple of comments around that. Last quarter GCX came online in the middle of the quarter. So we had some strong pricing opportunities if you will, in the first half of the fourth quarter last year which contributed to that quarter's results. As we move forward as we reiterated this morning we're on track with our earnings per share targets. And I'll also say that our contribution of our business between distribution and pipeline storage is going to be roughly the same as well. So that's roughly 2/3 distribution and 1/3 on the pipeline storage side. So as we continue to grow in that 6% to 8% range certainly for 2020 and as we look out through 2024, we expect the business mix between our two segments to be in that roughly that 2/3, 1/3 allocation, if you will. So it can ebb-and-flow a little bit, but we still see a lot of continued growth. And when you think about pipeline and storage most of the earnings drivers in that segment is the continued safety and reliability work that we are doing on our APT system. Kevin talks about the Bethel storage facility. So it's driven by fundamental rate based growth as a result of the supply or the -- what we're trying to accomplish from a safety perspective, as well as meeting the growing needs of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So I mean Chris the takeaway from your answer is that, since the mix of business is staying the same and we know distribution is growing pretty well that means pipeline and storage is really growing even though you're seeing this competitor pipeline?
Chris Forsythe: That's correct. And remember too on this competitive pipeline and we've been talking about this for a couple of years, the non-tariff businesses that run through the pipeline that represents a relatively small piece of the overall puzzle for APT, primarily due to the existence of a Rider REV mechanism. So whatever we tend to pick up, in terms of a commercial business activity on that pipe 75% of the benefit flows back to our regulated customers on the distribution side in our Mid-Tex Division in North Texas. So and you heard us consistently say over the years, when they pick up a little bit here and there, but we don't view that as a material driver of our performance. It could have a little bit of an impact in a given year, given pricing dynamics but we don't -- certainly don't look to it as a source of fundamental growth for the long term.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And if I could ask -- go ahead.
John Akers: Well, I was just going to add to that. Chris is exactly right. We don't see that as a competitor pipeline. Again with its direction its heading, it's mainly focused on takeaway out of the Permian down to the Gulf Coast area there. So we don't really see it as a competitor by nature because our responsibility on the pipeline side itself is those core markets and serving those core markets.
Charles Fishman: Okay. Got it. Now if I can ask just one more question on the new dome storage that's being developed how does that work from a regulatory standpoint? I mean I would assume a lot of that is for the benefit of your distribution system Mid-Tex et cetera?
Kevin Akers: Correct. It's for our -- making sure we have the reliability to continue to meet the contractual demands of those customers behind APT. All those costs that -- or investments into that are grip eligible and so the recovery through that mechanism.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So it's under grip. Got it. Okay.
Kevin Akers: Correct. 
Charles Fishman: That’s it. Thank you very much.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Charles.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now live.
Ryan Levine: Good morning. 
Kevin Akers: Hey, Ryan. 
Ryan Levine: Hey. What's your appetite to invest in the build-out of RNG infrastructure given your footprint and stated objectives of both AGA and Atmos?
Kevin Akers: Again, we're -- we want to operate responsibly. We want to take a look at opportunities that are out there, but we're going to take a look at it in the way that we've done everything else about our business. And what I mean by that is if you take a look at how we set up our rate structures over time, our annual mechanisms, our pipe mechanisms those sort of things we have to look at it from a regulatory perspective on investment and recovery of that investment and what those opportunities look like as well as what are the laws or regulations around that that exist today or may exist in the future. So, all that to say, we're keeping an eye on it. We're looking at it. But we are working with other industry partners and seeing what other states are doing to see how the regulatory environment plays out on those and how the legislative environment plays out on those. And when we see something that is of interest to us or ready to move forward we'll like we said with the rest of our rate structure make sure that it is tied up with our investment and the recovery and it benefits our customers across the enterprise.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then another one in terms of the O&M cost increase. I was wondering what impact the new PHMSA regulation have in your increased guidance for 2020 versus 2019.
Chris Forsythe: You see the O&M guidance that we've put out there we have already kind of anticipated those PHMSA rules coming into effect beginning in July of this calendar year. So it's going to be -- have a muted impact in 2020 and will continue to roll in on a full fiscal year basis and beginning in 2021. But we've already contemplated that in our O&M forecast through 2024.
Ryan Levine: Is there a way to quantify the magnitude of that impact versus the other items that were highlighted from an earlier question?
Chris Forsythe: We don't have that information readily available.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then the last question for me. Curious what your gas price assumption is in your 2020 guide. And with the weakness in spot basis in some of your jurisdictions curious how much regulatory headroom you have versus your guidance in terms of customer builds?
Chris Forsythe: Well, we've got -- you'll see it in our Analyst Day this deck that we put out last fall, I think, we're at an all-in price anywhere from $3.20 -- $5.25 to $5.50 inclusive of storage and transportation costs. Storage and current transportation is usually between $1 and $1.50. So we assumed a high $2, low $3 range on the commodity pricing. So to the extent that we have lower pricing that we're able to capture from our various sources of gas, it's obviously a benefit that flows back to our customers. And we've got a very good gas supply team in our shared services function that is working to minimize the cost of gas across the enterprise.
Ryan Levine: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Marc Solecitto from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Marc Solecitto: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning.
Marc Solecitto: Kind of following up on some of the earlier questions, can you quantify the year-over-year impact from Waha basis differentials in fiscal 1Q?
Chris Forsythe: If you look through our MDA, it's roughly down about a $750,000 to $1 million. It's in our line item that flows -- it's not on our Mid-Tex line, but it's our pipeline, it's in our three-system line item. So it's out there in the 10-Q.
Marc Solecitto: Got it. Okay. And then in terms of your FY 2020 EPS guidance, I think, Waha spreads were $12 million year-over-year tailwind in fiscal 2019. Just curious what the embedded assumption was in your fiscal 2020 guidance. Or maybe said differently if you captured any benefit in fiscal 2020 would that represent upside to your budget?
Chris Forsythe: We made a call based upon market conditions at the time that we put the plan together last summer, but we haven't released those specific details.
Marc Solecitto: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through May 7, 2020. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Jessie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 54 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Christ Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 net income of $511 million, or $4.35 per diluted share. This represents the 17th consecutive year of rising earnings per share. Slide 6 and 7 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights. Consolidated contribution margin rose about 5% or about $95 million. Rate increases driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending provided an incremental $80 million. Virtually all of these increases were in our Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi jurisdictions. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, our pipeline and storage segment benefited from the supply and demand dynamics that have impacted pricing in the Permian Basin over the last 12 to 18 months. We were able to capture a portion of the widened Waha and Katy spread, resulting in a $12 million increase over fiscal 2018. However, as expected, a new merchant pipeline came online mid-summer and we saw narrower spread opportunities in the back half of the fourth quarter. Finally, our distribution segment continuing to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 37,000 customers a 1.2% increase over the last year. Consolidated operating expenses rose approximately 6%, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending and higher O&M spending, attributed to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance activities and higher employee costs. As we discussed last quarter and fiscal 2019, we increased service related headcount in our Mid-Tex division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we continue to roll-out - our roll-out of advanced leak survey technology. All of this roll-out has modestly increased our O&M. It plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. Finally, we continue to increase the training provided to employees to further enable them to operate our system safely and reliably. Consolidated capital spending increased 15% to $1.7 billion with 87% of our spending directed toward investments to improve the safety and reliability of our system. Our ability to support this level of capital spending is due in part to the various regulatory mechanisms we have in place to minimize regulatory lag. During fiscal 2019 over 85% of our capital spending began to earn a return within six months of the test period ends. We accomplished this by implementing a $117 million in annualized operating income increases in 23 regulatory proceedings. Since September 30th, we have implemented an additional $57 million through six regulatory proceedings that were filed in the back half of fiscal 2019. As of today, we have four filings pending, seeking about $6 million. Slide 39 to 53 summarizes regulatory activities for fiscal 2019. Our ability to support this level of capital spending is also predicated on our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our ongoing capital expenditure program while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we continue to utilize equity forward agreements executed under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 equity needs. We issued 1.4 million shares at an average price of $108.70. Additionally, we sell forward agreements for $1.1 million and 1.1 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of September 30, 2019, we had about $463 million remaining under equity forward arrangements. This issuance completed a very busy financing year, when we are able to successfully raise over $2 billion of debt and equity financing. In the process, we reduce a weighted average cost of debt from 5.21% to 4.58% and increased our weighted average maturities from 16 years to 22 years, helping to ensure our customers benefit in the current low interest rate environment for years to come. And our equity capitalization increased 230 basis points to 59% as of September 30. We finished the fiscal year with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. Details of our financing activities including our equity forward arrangements, as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 9 to 11. Looking forward, fiscal 2020 represent the 9th year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our plan to summarize on Slide 13. We expect fiscal 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share, with about 68% of our earnings coming from our distribution segment. By fiscal 2024, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per diluted share. Slides 14 and 15 present some of the details supporting our fiscal 2020 guidance. O&M is expected to be in line with fiscal 2019. Our O&M will continue to be focused on risk-based activities that address system safety and compliance. These activities include enhanced leak survey, pipeline integrity work and continued records establishment and retention. It also includes spending to work to help us, to set a baseline of understanding of our system for PHMSA's new integrity management rules go into effect on July 1, 2020. As we've discussed in the past, we have been anticipating these new rules for few years and reflected that activity in our future O&M projections. As a result, similar to last year's five-year plan, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 2.5% to 3.5% annually. Depreciation will rise due to high-level capital spending; interest expense was lower as we reduced our weighted average cost of debt and expect to capitalize more interest through AFUDC. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in fiscal 2020, inclusive of the impact of amortizing our excess deferred tax liabilities. Excluding this amortization, we anticipate the effective tax rate to range between 23% to 25%. Fiscal 2020 capital spending is expected to rise about 12% and range between $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion with approximately 86% of this spending dedicated to safety and reliability spending. Approximately 73% of the spending will be allocated to our distribution segment. Almost 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to earning a return within six months of the test period end. Continued spending for system replacement modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2024. As you can see on Slide 17, we anticipate capital spending to increase 7% to 8% per year off of fiscal 2019 spend levels, for total of $10 billion to $11 billion over the next five years. This level of spending is expected to approximately 4 times depreciation annually. This result in rate base growth about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base at $17 billion to $18 billion in fiscal 2024, up about $9 billion at the end of fiscal 2019 as you can see on Slide 18. Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means that which will be cover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract new capital needed to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to our customer bill will provide in the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We've assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2020, we anticipate completing filings for $160 million to $180 million of annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Moving to Slide 20. In line with our financial performance for fiscal 2019, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved their 144th consecutive quarterly cash dividend yesterday. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2020 is $2.30, a 9.5% increase over fiscal 2019. We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next five years. And we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% as it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. This five-year plan continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors, while preserving our strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing for our customers. Based on our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next five years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing in order to maintain a balanced capital structure with a targeted equity to capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized in Slide 21. And consistent prior plans, our financing plan have been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2024. In October, we got off to a great start toward executing this plan with the issuance of $800 million in long-term debt. We issued a mix of 10-year and 30-year notes to achieve a weighted average cost of debt of 3.18% in this offering. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt decreased another 26 basis points to 4.32%. From an equity perspective, we announced during fiscal 2019 that we did not receive the need for discrete equity issuance in fiscal 2020. The equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2019 are expected to satisfy substantial portion of our equity needs for the fiscal year. We expect to remain - raise the remaining equity needs for 2020 through our ATM program. In closing, the execution of our operating plans to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends per share 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2024. And as you can see on Slides 22 and 23, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which helped us to sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his prepared remarks.
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Fiscal 2019 was the eighth consecutive year of successfully executing our proven investment strategy, focused on operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system. Our 70,000 miles of distribution pipeline and 5,700 miles of intrastate pipeline provide safe and reliable service to our customers every day. In addition to achieving our financial targets for fiscal 2019, we continue to modernize our system. In fiscal year 2019 as you saw on Slide 27, our team replaced about 770 miles of distribution pipe, 120 mile of transmission pipe and 53,000 service lines across the eight states in which we operate. We continue to utilize technology to modernize our business. In fiscal 2019, we deployed new technology called Locus Map that allows us to digitally capture asset data as we complete our project. This technology is helping us to scale our operations and improve the quality and timeliness of our asset data collection requirement. At the end of fiscal 2019, this roll-out was about 50% complete and on track to be fully implement by the end of fiscal 2020. We also continued our systematic roll-out of advanced leak detection technology to enhance our ability to monitor our system, keep the public site and to help us prioritize the pipe replacement work. At our customer support centers, we completed the implementation of new technology that we refer to as skill-based routing. Skill-based routing matches a caller due to the customer support associate that suited to handle their need by using predicted analytics within our SAP system. Our electronic billing continues to be one of the highest in the industry at 43%. Based on a 2019 American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute benchmarking survey our penetration for electronic billing was rated Number 1 for gas only utility and Number 4 for all gas electric in combination utility. We increased our electronic billing penetration about 2.4% in fiscal year 2019. Also in fiscal year 2019, our Spanish Account Center was released, along with an upgrade to our integrated voice response system. These are just a few examples of the many initiatives we have in progress or completed as we modernize our system and our business. As you know, our vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services and training is key to part of that vision. In 2019, we provided nearly 288,000 hours at our Charles K. Vaughan center and surpassed the 1.3 million mark in total training hours, since the facility opened in 2010. This training is critical to our success because it helps us work smarter and safer. We also completed our pipeline safety management system assessment and are working on our high level road map for addressing gas. While we have had components of a safety management system including procedures, policies and practices for years, the safety management system formalizes what we are doing and as another layer of rigor and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk. It is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. Our employees continue to provide exceptional customer service at every opportunity. Our customers give us a 98% satisfaction rating for both our contact center agents and our service technicians. These men and women are the heart, the soul and face of Atmos Energy. I'm extremely proud of them and how well they represent as each and every opportunity. In addition to providing safe and reliable service and exceptional customer service, our employees support the communities where we live and work. In fiscal 2019, I'm proud to say that we donated nearly $5 million to various charitable causes as well as helped our most vulnerable customers gain access to nearly $6 million of funding to help pay their heating bills. By all measures, fiscal 2019 was another successful year for Atmos Energy. I'm very excited about the future of Atmos Energy and I look forward to executing the ninth year of our successful strategy as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. This straightforward focused improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in an environmentally responsible manner. The $10 billion to $11 billion capital spending plan over the next five years will continue to be in the areas of system modernization, system fortification, customer growth and technology that improve safety drive efficiency and build scale. Over 85% of these investments will be focused on safety and reliability, identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy. Continued emphasis will be placed on the removing industry identified materials such as Bare Steel, Vintage Plastics and Cast Iron. Atmos Pipeline Texas investments in addition to safety, we will focus on reliability, fortifying our ability to meet the growing demand particularly here in our North Texas service territory. At the end of the five-year investment period, our safe system will be significantly more modern. As you can see on Slide 27, we anticipate this level of filming will support the replacement of 5,000 miles to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of our last 400 miles of cast iron in our system by the end of 2021. And the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex Division. We also plan to replace between 200,000 and 300,000 steel service plans, which is expected to reduce our inventory about 29%. And 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading by the end of this period. Finally, this level replacement is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 10% to 15% over the next five years. We continue to fine-tune our planning and forecasting capabilities, incorporating lessons learned and new requirements to ensure the work is done right, and to further improve our ability to execute on our strategy. We have a proven track record of managing and growing these investments in a safe and responsible manner because of our employees and our leaders. They have despite the skills, experience, and training and have the technology to execute this strategy exceptionally well. Our management committee leads the execution of this strategy. This committee have supported by seven divisional leadership team, each comprised of a President and Vice President, representing operational and financial areas of responsibility and a strong centralized shared service team. This somewhat unique structure helps us to ensure strong governance and executional oversight at the local level and it also serves to internally develop a wide number of people for potentially more senior roles in the company. Our management team is supported by the engaged Board of Directors. The Board of Directors possesses a strong balance of experience to provide deep insight, strong governance and management oversight with a fresh perspective. During fiscal 2019, we further strengthened our Board oversight with the establishment of the corporate responsibility and sustainability committee. This committee now monitors the current and emerging ESG landscape or issues that could materially affect our business and overseas all of our ESG efforts. Together, this positions Atmos Energy for sustained success in the future as we continue to provide safe, reliable, efficient and affordable natural gas service to our 3 million customers in over 1,400 communities. All as we continue working in sync with our regulators to advance safety and reliability. Our cultured Atmos spirit is the secret sauce that supports us and provides the necessary foundation for our continued success in our ability to execute consistently. Now 20 years old, Atmos spirit established the long-standing guiding principles of our culture today. These principles are inspiring trust, create your best, bring out the best in others, make a difference and focus on the future. Reflect the values, beliefs and behaviors we embrace as a company. In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 our employees for their dedication to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and for giving back to the communities where they live and work each and every day. They are the heart and soul of our company and the biggest reason Atmos Energy will be successful for the long term. We appreciate your time this morning, and now we will take any questions you may have.

Operator: It appears we have no questions at this time. So I would like to pass the floor back over to Ms. Hills for any additional concluding comments.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you for joining us today. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February 5, 2020. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Good bye.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-08-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Diego. Good morning, everyone. This is Jennifer Hills, Vice President, Investor Relations, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I’m joined by Mike Haefner, President and CEO; Kevin Akers, Executive Vice President; Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Kim Cocklin, Executive Chairman. This call is being webcast live on the Internet, and our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com under Company and Investor Relations. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 27, and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Mike Haefner, President and CEO of Atmos Energy. Mike?
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. And happy birthday, Jennifer. In Investor Relations nothing says happy birthday more than hosting an earnings call. So congratulations. Yesterday, we reported our fiscal 2019 third quarter results and I’m pleased to report that we’re on track to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance, a $4.25 to $4.35, an increased earnings per share for the 17th consecutive year. Capital spending increased 10% during the first nine months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. Approximately 87% of this spending was focused on safety and reliability investments, as we continue to execute our risk-based capital spending program to modernize our distribution and transmission systems. Through June 30, 2019, we completed $2.1 billion of financing, which has supported our fiscal 2019 capital spending, further strengthened our balance sheet, lowered the cost of financing for our customers, and leaves us very well-positioned to maintain our credit ratings for the long-term. We continue to invest in technology, our people and processes to achieve operating excellence and scale our capabilities to sustain our safety-driven strategy. With the team we have in place, we’re extremely well-positioned for continued success into the future. Yesterday, we announced that I’ll step down from my role as President and Chief Executive Officer effective September 30, to focus on my health. I will remain with the Company through the end of the calendar year to support the transition, and I will retire from the Company, and plan to step down from the Board effective January 1, 2020. Also announced yesterday that Kevin Akers, currently Executive Vice President has been appointed by the Board to succeed me as President and CEO, and become a member of the Board effective October 1, of this year. Kim Cocklin will continue as Executive Chairman. This was a very difficult decision for me, but it’s the right decision for the Company, for me and for my family. I’ve been facing a recent health issue that at this point is alluded a definitive diagnosis. I’m extremely optimistic this will resolve itself favorably in the long run. However, it’s requiring an increasing amount of my time, and that necessitates me pulling back on my commitments. This decision was made a much, much easier for me by the fact that Kevin Akers is ready to assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin is a proven leader with broad company and industry experience, a majority of the nearly 29 years with the company have been in senior leadership position. He has deep operating experience, having previously served for over nine years as President of our Kentucky Mid-States Division, five years as President of our Mississippi Division, and more recently took on responsibility for the Company’s pipeline and storage operations. For the past several years, Kevin also oversaw our pipeline safety, supply chain, and customer service functions. And he has been instrumental in driving the process improvement and technology initiatives that has enabled the company to scale its operations to sustain our success. Many of you already know Kevin from our Analyst Days, the past two years, as well as the AGA Financial Forum, and other investor conferences this year. Kevin is surrounded by a very seasoned senior leadership team. Chris and the rest of our management committee will continue in their current roles. They worked closely together for many, many years and even prior to being on the management committee. Not only are they respected colleagues, but they’re also friends. And Kevin has the full support of our 4,700 employees. One of our Board’s most important responsibility is succession planning, and they’ve done that master fully over our 36 years as an independent public company. This succession plan has been in place for several years. And just as with prior transitions from our founder Charlie Vaughan to Bob Best to Kim Cocklin to me, the transition to Kevin will be completely seamless. As I mentioned earlier, Kim will continuing the role of Executive Chairman. I’ll be forever grateful to him as a great leader, as a mentor and a friend. His continued involvement in the company as Chairman as well as advisor to Kevin and the rest of the management committee will provide further assurance of the Company’s continued success. And lastly, before I turn the call over to Chris for the financial update, I’d like to thank the investors and analysts I’ve had the distinct pleasure to get to know over the past four years. Your support and investment of time and capital has been so critical to the success of our safety investment strategy. Your insights and challenging questions have made us a better company and it may me a better leader. I’d also like to thank our 4,700 employees for their continued outstanding efforts to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable, and exceptional natural gas service for the 3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our eight state footprints. They come to work every single day focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. It’s been my greatest honor to serve alongside them for the past 11 years. They are the reason that Atmos Energy will continue to be successful for a long-term. Chris, over to you.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported 2019 third quarter net income of $80 million or $0.68 per diluted share, compared with $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year third quarter. Year-to-date, net income was $453 million or $3.88 per diluted share, compared with $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Fiscal 2018 year-to-date results included $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share non-recurring income tax benefit from tax reform. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted net income was $398 million or $3.60 per diluted share. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations with many of the drivers underlying our performance during the first half of the year, continuing into the third quarter. Slides 5 and 6 provide details for our quarter and year-to-date results. I will touch in few of the highlights. In our Distribution segment, operating income increased $14.4 million to $48.7 million in the third quarter, as a modest increase in contribution margin was offset by a higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased up $1 million quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a $7 million increase from new rates and nearly $3 million increase from customer growth. At 12 months ended June 30, 2019, we added a net 35,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. We are on track to exceed 1% net customer growth for the third consecutive year. These increases were offset by $4 million decrease in customer consumption, primarily due to warmer weather in the third quarter compared to the prior year. As a reminder, most for weather normalization mechanisms end in April, so contribution margin does not cover for most of the quarter. Operating expenses rose approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital spending, and planned 10% increase in O&M expense. As we discussed last quarter, we increased service related headcount in our Mid-Tex Division to support the growth in our DFW market. Additionally, we experienced a 7% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locate, as many of our communities in which we operate continued to experience strong growth. We continue to rollout new leak survey technology into our operations. This technology is 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional leak survey technology. Therefore, we are finding more potential leak indications, which drives the need to hire or contract the people to evaluate and assess these indications. While the deployment of this technology will increase O&M expense in the near term, it plays an important role in our ability to identify and mitigate risk. For example, during the quarter, we had used this technology in several of our jurisdictions that hit by heavy storms to assess or assist for damage. The performance of our pipeline in storage segment substantially offset the operating income decrease in our distribution segment. Operating income increased $12 million, driven by strong growth in contribution margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Contribution margin increased $22 million as a result of APT GRIP filings in 2018 and 2019, combined with the $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter rise in APT’s through-system revenue as a result of the ongoing supply and demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin. The activity we experienced in the quarter was higher than anticipated due to two unexpected force majeure events on other pipelines, which drove higher than expected volumes into our system. However, as new merchant pipeline comes online starting late this summer, we expect the Waha to Katy spread to narrow. Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was a $10 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation related to increased capital expenditures and the planned increase in pipeline integrity work. Year-to-date consolidated capital spending was 10% or increased 10% to $1.2 billion, which is in line with our plan. We continue to focus our spending and improving the safety and reliability of our spending – of our system or reliability of our systems manually 87% focused on safety and reliability. Based on work completed year-to-date and planned spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2019 capital spending to be between $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion. From a regulatory perspective to-date, we have completed 21 filings, which should add approximately $110 million of annualized operating income over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. And we have six filings pending about – seeking about $87 million in annualized operating income. We are on track to complete some of these filings during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Assuming these proceedings are resolved in line with our expectations, we remain on track to meet our target of completing $160 million to $180 million in annualized operating outcomes. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and supports our capital spending program. As of June 30, our equity total capitalization was 60%, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and through our equity forward agreements. Slide 9 summarizes our fiscal 2019 financing activities. Year-to-date, we have completed $2.1 billion of financing, including the issuance of $1.1 billion of long-term debt and $1 billion of equity. During the quarter, we continue to utilize forward agreements under our ATM to help meet our fiscal 2020 needs. We issued 1.1 million shares at an average price of $101.41. Additionally, we settled the forward agreements for 1.1 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $100 million. As of June 30, we had about $410 million remaining under our forward agreements. Details on equity forward activities can also be found on Slide 9. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well positioned to meet our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. However, given the higher than expected Permian Basin activity we saw during the third quarter, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range. Slides 12 and 13 provide selected information underlying our fiscal 2019 guidance. And we are well positioned to meet our five-year annual EPS growth target of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2023. We’ll be rolling forward our five-year plan through 2024 on our fiscal year-end earnings call in November. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for some closing remarks. Kevin?
Kevin Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Mike, thank you for those kind of remarks. We are deeply indebted to you for your leadership, your vision and unwavering dedication and support for Atmos Energy, and every one of our 4,700 employees. I’m very excited about the future of Atmos Energy, and I look forward to continuing the execution of the successful strategy that Kim and Mike have put in place, as we maintain our focus on our vision of being the nation’s safest provider of natural gas services. A key to achieving that vision is to continue the evolution and refinement of our strategy by making investments in safety and reliability, while modernizing our business to sustain our Company for the long-term. This straightforward focused improvement strategy benefits all stakeholders as we strive to safely provide excellent customer service in environmentally responsible manner. As we’ve discussed before, increasing our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023 requires that we also invest in our people and technology. I’m proud to report that during the third quarter, we crossed over the 1 million hour mark for total cumulative hours of training provided at our state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan center, which opened in 2010. This training is essential for our employees to become highly qualified gas professionals. We continue to roll out our latest map digital asset data collection solution. Through the first nine months of this fiscal year, we had approximately 35% of our Company and contract construction crews trained on using this important technology. And we continue to systematically roll out our advanced mobile leak detection technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system, as Chris mentioned earlier. Implementing a safety management system is another strategic focus. While we have had components of a safety management system including procedures, policies and practices for many years, the safety management system formalizes what we are doing, and is an integral part supporting our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services. We’ve completed our pipeline safety management system assessment, and plan to have our high level road map developed for addressing gas later this fall. These are just a few of the examples of how our investments in training and technology position us for sustained success in the future. In closing, I would like to thank our 4,700 employees, their dedication to safely operating our system, while providing excellent customer service and giving back to the communities where they work and live. That is the biggest reason Atmos Energy will be successful for the long-term. We appreciate your time this morning. And now, we’ll take any questions you may have.
Jennifer Hills: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.
Christopher Turnure: Good morning, everyone. Very sorry to hear the news. Mike, best wishes to you and your family.
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Chris.
Christopher Turnure: As we look forward to fourth quarter earnings and potentially an Analyst Day again this year, how can we think about the outlook for beyond the current plan, kind of 2024, and beyond anything potentially changing there, especially given the acceleration of CapEx that we saw out of you guys last year?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Chris, this is Chris Forsythe. Good morning. Our intent this fall was to not have an Analyst Day, but we’ll have an extended fiscal year-end earnings call, we’ll cover off the remainder of fiscal 2019, and really focused on where we’re going to be going into fiscal 2020. And really the story and the strategy remains the same. As we’ve talked about with you and others on the call, we have a long backlog of work to do, if you will. Just a lot of work to get done in terms of pipe replacement. So we will be just rolling it forward another year. You’ll expect to see just an increase in line with the increases in capital spending that you’ve seen from us over the last several years. Financing strategy is going to be pretty consistent with what you’ve seen as well. We’ll update and fresh in those numbers on that call. But I think the key takeaway today is that the strategy is the same and will just be a roll forward of what we’ve demonstrated through 2020 for you at this point.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And Chris, that kind of all sounds great, obviously. And you feel like there is no customer bill pressures or even kind of balance sheet constraints, despite the strength of your balance sheet right now that would come into play in that time frame, that would perhaps slow the rate based growth trend?
Chris Forsythe: We’re not seeing anything from a customer bill perspective. You can go back to our charts that we’ve shown that our bill is by far the lowest bill in the household from a utility perspective. And the strength of our balance sheet and we’re committed to maintain the strength of that balance sheet going forward.
Christopher Turnure: Okay, great. And then my second question is around near-term financing, as you mentioned in the remarks, and I think the Q as well, you priced around 1 million shares this quarter, and then you also pulled down around 1 million shares as well from I guess one of the earlier ATMs. So given your prior commentary on not – I think it was not meeting any more equity this year from the ATM programs. Was there something that changed there or caused you to tap that equity during the quarter?
Chris Forsythe: No, no. I think what we are indicating is that we were – we didn’t have any discrete equity needs. In our last quarter call we said, we had no discrete equity issuances planned through the end of fiscal 2020. We do – we did have the proceeds available first on the forward arrangements, which as you know expire. Some of the most of the proceeds right now expire at the end of March with about a little over $100 million expiring at the end of September. So we’re needing to utilize those proceeds. So we had intended all along to draw it down on those proceeds as capital needs arise or cash need to arise in that period. So all of that again is baked into our fiscal 2019 guidance. It’s baked into our five-year plan, $5.40 to $5.80. And as we look forward, we stated in the current five-year plan we have published a $5 billion to $6 billion incremental financing need that we intend to finance that in a balanced fashion using both long-term debt and equity. So, again roll – well, that strategy is going to look very similar when we roll that forward in November. But again, the financing that we did in the third quarter is not satisfy FY2019 equity needs. That will satisfy or FY2020 needs and beyond.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. That’s clear. Thank you, Chris.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America. Please state your question.
Dennis Coleman: Yes. Good morning. And let me add my thoughts. Mike, never knew that anyone likes to get so certainly best wishes as you pursue your health and thoughts with your family as well. On the other side, congratulations…
Mike Haefner: Thank you so much. Dennis, I certainly will miss all the opportunities we had to talk in the past. And I’ll miss seeing all you guys in the future. But again, as I mentioned in my comments, and I’m very optimistic that if I gear down a gear or two, I have the opportunity to find a good solution for this.
Dennis Coleman: Great. I hope that’s the case. Congratulations also to you Kevin. Best of luck with the new role and responsibilities. Big shoes to fill, but great Company to work with so.
Kevin Akers: Absolutely. Thank you.
Dennis Coleman: So a question – a couple of questions for me. I guess first on the expense side, expenses did run up, certainly a little more than we thought. Can you just talk about sort of I guess the roll forward on the expense side? Some of it seems a bit transient, but any help you can give there, Chris, would certainly be appreciated.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Sure, Dennis. I mean, like I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it’s really continuation of what we’ve been experiencing and what we’ve been trying to accomplish from a risk-based perspective. And when we talk about the second quarter going into the third quarter, so that was continuing to roll out the AMLD technology that Kevin commented on – we are – because it’s new to us, the indications that came in just require a little bit more assessment. A lot of that work is O&M. But over time, we expect as we gain proficiency that, that should come back in the line with the 2.5% to 3.5% guidelines that we established for the five-year plan last fall. Additionally, we talked about low pressure assessments. And when you get an opportunity with increases in margins, we’re always looking to take risk off the table from an O&M expected. So we’ve been increasing our I guess risk-based O&M work, so that’s in line inspections, that’s right away maintenance, that’s low pressure system assessments, anything we can do to reduce risk in the current period that will benefit for future periods. So that’s the type of work that you’re seeing in the O&M line item. And we’ll just continue to manage that going forward as need to arise and as opportunities arise as well.
Dennis Coleman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess on the leak detection technology, obviously, a fair amount said there. I guess I thought I heard you say you’ve rolled it out to additional markets. I think last quarter it was just mostly Texas space. But can you talk about has it – have you rolled it out in all markets now?
Kevin Akers: Not in – this is Kevin. Not in all of our markets. We currently had 11 units. Here we rolled addition amount here with plans the next fiscal year to roll some additional units out to our West Texas area. We have an existing unit in Louisiana and one in Mississippi as well. So that – those are the markets that we’re talking about there.
Dennis Coleman: Okay, all right. That’s it from me. Thank you.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Dennis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please state your question.
Ryan Levine: Good morning.
Mike Haefner: Good morning.
Ryan Levine: And I wanted to also echo some of the previous comments to that, Mike, sorry to hear about this development. But best of luck to you and your family.
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: And then I guess in that lies a question. Can you just speak to the transition process, and if this was sudden, and what are the steps over the next few quarters as Kevin takes the CEO seat?
Mike Haefner: Sure. This is Mike. Ryan and it’s up. As I mentioned in my comments, this succession plan has been in place for quite a while. And even prior to that, the way we operate, I’ve worked very closely with Kevin and the entire leadership team worked very closely together. Over the last two and a half years, our management committee meets for a half a day and then informally several days a week. So we’re completely in lockstep. And Kevin and I worked side-by-side and all of the initiatives that he has been driving for scale and scope. So – I mean, in a nutshell, the transition is going to be extremely smooth and uneventful internally since we’ve been working so closely together all along. As – whereas I mentioned, and he and I are working even more closely now. But as I mentioned earlier, he’ll assume the President and CEO position on October 1. I will be still around and available to him and meet with them on a regular basis through the end of the calendar year. And also as I mentioned, Jim is – will continue as Executive Chairman, and he’s always been tremendously helpful to all of us as an advisor. So I know it’s not similar to many other companies, but at Atmos everybody is in the same – we’re in the same bullpen and dug out, every single day of the week. So it’s – and then strategy, as Chris said, is not going to change. It’s a matter of scaling sustaining our success, and just executing well, taking care of our employees in the process, making sure they’ve got development opportunities, the training they need, we mainly in compliance. And all the things that we talk about regularly, Kevin had the responsibility for the last couple of years. Obviously, executed by our division leadership and shared services leadership, but he’s got a firm hand on the pillar right now, so it will be a non-event.
Ryan Levine: Okay. Thanks for the color. And then a couple of more specific questions. In terms of the O&M cost inflation, over what period of time do you think there’ll be some type of elevated level as the more sensitive centers detect an additional opportunity for safety improvement?
Chris Forsythe: I think we’re already seeing some improvements in the productivity of the crews. And I would just say that we’re going to be back in line with the 2.5% to 3.5% O&M – a targeted O&M increase over the five-year plan through 2023, and then we’ll roll that forward in November through 2024.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And what was the impact of the Waha basis differentials to your business this past quarter? I think you disclosed some numbers in previous quarters, so curious what the update there?
Chris Forsythe: It was – the impact quarter-over-quarter is about $4.5 million.
Ryan Levine: In income?
Chris Forsythe: In the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And that’s contribution margin which is effectively revenue for us, so.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And – okay. That’s helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Stephen Byrd: Good morning.
Mike Haefner: Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning.
Stephen Byrd: Mike, I just want to say you will be dearly missed. You’re a great executive and a great person, just great to interact with. So we’re all wishing for you to address this health issues successfully and we really wish you and your family all the best. Can’t thank you enough for all your help over the years. You will be missed.
Mike Haefner: Thank you so much for everything you’ve done as well, Stephen. Appreciate it.
Stephen Byrd: And Kevin, look forward to working with you in your new role. Most of my questions have been addressed. I thought I’d just check really on the financing plan. I think your financing plan is very clear. But just given the – just a very low interest rate environment that we’re in, I just thought I double check in terms of just additional opportunistic ways to kind of lock in lower cost of debt over a long period of time. I think your average duration already pretty long at 22 years, but I just thought I’d check if there just anything else that might be possible?
Kevin Akers: Yes. That’s a good question, Stephen. And that’s something that we’re evaluating right now. We’re mindful of where the markets have gotten certainly here in the last week or so. You’ve pointed out our matured average duration is about 22 years. For all in average, our weighted average cost of debt right now is 4.55% after we effectuated the two debt offerings that we’ve done this fiscal year. So as we look forward, we’re certainly evaluating opportunities to further drive that overall cost of debt down, but nothing specific that I can comment on at this point.
Stephen Byrd: Understood. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Kevin Akers: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn it back to Jennifer Hills for closing remarks. Thanks.
Jennifer Hills: All right. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through November 6, 2019. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-05-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Atmos Energy Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. This is Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm joined by Mike Haefner, our President and CEO; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO. This call is being webcast live on the internet and our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com under Company and Investor Relations. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 27 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings of $215 million or $1.82 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $135 million or $1.57 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings, excluding $4 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Year-to-date, earnings were $373 million or $3.21 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $327 million or $2.97 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings excluded a $166 million benefit related to the implementation of tax reform. Also yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the 142nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share in fiscal 2019 and 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The recovery of the capital spending required to modernize the natural gas delivery network, continued customer growth in the plant increase and safety related operating expenses were the primary drivers of the quarter's results. Slides five and six provide details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few highlights. In the second quarter, operating income in our distribution segment increased 8% to $229 million. Recovery provided by recent regulatory actions increased contribution margin by $24 million. Additionally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, we added a net 37,000 new customers, which represents 1.2% growth. We continue to experience strong customer growth in several of our service areas, including the DFW Metroplex, the suburbs of Nashville into the north of Austin and the left of Kansas to the Western Kansas City. This growth added $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and almost $8 million year-to-date. However, despite weather that was 9% colder than the prior year quarter, customer consumption declined due to varying weather patterns quarter-over-quarter which reduced contribution margin by about - $9 million. Operating expenses decreased by about 1%. In the prior year quarter, we incurred $23 million related to customer assistance and other non-recurring expenses related to the outage in Northwest Dallas. After adjusting for these expenses, operating expenses increased approximately 9%, more than half of this increase reflects higher depreciation and ad valorem taxes driven by last year's capital spending. The remaining increase related to a planned increase in system integrity and maintenance work such as - digital mapping of legacy assets and work to mitigate and reduce third-party damage to our system. Additionally, we experienced higher labor and training costs as we have added service technicians and leak survey specialist to support our Mid-Tex operations in the DFW Metroplex. Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment increased about 16% to $69 million during the second quarter. New rates from our last year's GRIP filing contributed $12 million of this growth. Additionally, APT continued to benefit from the supply and demand dynamics in the Permian Basin. APT's through system revenue increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $4.5 million year-to-date, net other Rider REV mechanism. APT's tariff customers continue to benefit from this mechanism, while our distribution customers in Texas receive the benefit of low cost of gas produced in this region. Operating expenses increased $6 million or about 9%, about half of this increase reflects higher depreciation expense as a result of last year's capital spending. Additionally, we plan for incremental pipeline integrity work, which was the primary driver for the remainder of the increase in operating expenses. Consolidated capital spending increased 12% to $778 million year-to-date about 84 of this - 84% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the fiscal year. From a financing perspective, we had another busy quarter as we completed over $600 million of financing. We refinanced our $450 million, 8.5% 10-year notes with 4.125% 30-year notes. As a result of the financing, our overall cost of debt decreased to 4.6% and our weighted average maturity increased to 22 years. Additionally, as most of you are aware, we moved to the S&P 500 from the S&P MidCap 400 in mid-February. We took advantage of this unplanned unique liquidity event to issue 1.0 million shares to forward sales arrangements executed under our ATM program. The net proceeds of $159 million from these forward sales arrangements were used towards our equity needs for fiscal 2020 and will not be fully diluted until issued in fiscal 2020. These net proceeds combined with the $245 million in net proceeds issued under forward sales arrangements to our - during our November equity issuance, leaves us with just over $400 million to help fund our capital spending through March 31, 2020 when all of these forward sales arrangements mature. Based on the execution of these forward arrangements, the remaining availability under our ATM program and our current capital spending outlook, we do not foresee the need for discrete equity issuance, through the end of fiscal 2020. As a result of our financing activities this year, our equity to total capitalization was 60% and our short-term debt balance was 0 at quarter end. Including the $108 million in cash on hand at the end of March and the $404 million in net proceeds available under the forward sales arrangements, we have approximately $2.1 billion of total available liquidity. After resetting most of our regulatory mechanisms last year, our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar has returned to a more traditional cadence. To-date, we had implemented $86 million of annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $90 million in progress. Annual filings in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are among the most significance of these filings or filings. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I wanted to comment on our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance. Yesterday we narrowed our guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Slides 12 and 13 provide additional details of our updated guidance. Earnings for the first half of fiscal year were in line with our expectations. We should see potential for a modest uptick in AT - APT contribution margins as a result of the supply and demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin. However, as we had communicated before, settlements are focused on preparing APT for winter operations for the next fiscal year and we do not expect the impact to be material. Additionally, we have completed our fiscal 2019 financing program, and we now have clarity on how those - that financing will impact fiscal 2019 results. Finally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated several efforts that will further mitigate long-term risk. Following the incident of New England last fall, we are now assessing our low pressure systems and implementing additional procedures to continue to safely managing these systems. Additionally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we initiated a multi-year effort to implement new leak detection technology. The preliminary results from the initial pilot efforts have been encouraging and we'll continue to methodically implement this technology in certain of our jurisdictions during the second half of the fiscal year. And in the second half of the fiscal year, we are planning to run additional in-line inspections in our pipeline and storage segment to facilitate capital allocation - decisions for fiscal 2020 and beyond. Our performance for the first half of the fiscal year and additional clarity we have for the second half of the fiscal year leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal 2019. I'll now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks. Mike?
Michael Haefner: Thank you, Chris for that great update on the quarter. Our results for the first half of the fiscal year reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of the investments we're making in safety and reliability of our system, while continuing to - mitigate long-term risk. Capital spending increased 12% during the first six months of the fiscal year, which demonstrates our commitment to modernizing our system. As we plan to increase our spending 9% to 10% per year through fiscal 2023, we're also investing in our people and technology to support these higher spending levels. Last fall, we started to implement new technology that will digitally capture all the data - we are required to collect and retain for compliance purposes. We completed the rollout to about 20% of the nearly 1,000 company and contractor crews working on our system, we're on track to expand the rollout to about 50% of these crews by fiscal year end. This is just one example of the various initiatives we have underway to build scale and efficiency to sustain our ability to invest in safety and reliability. During the first half of the fiscal year, we also continue to find ways to mitigate risk for the long-term. The increased O&M spending that Chris referred to in the second half of the fiscal year for low pressure system assessment, systematic rollout and newly survey technology and in-line inspections on our transmission system will help us implement new procedures and technology that will enhance our ability to safely operate our system and support our risk-based capital allocation program. This spending does not affect our anticipated 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth through fiscal 2023. Additionally, as Chris mentioned, our move to the S&P 500, created an unplanned and unique liquidity event to issue equity under forward sales arrangements through our ATM that will be used toward our fiscal 2020 equity needs. These are just a couple of examples of how we remain agile when conditions evolve to mitigate operational and execution risk for the long-term. These equity forward arrangements, combined with the additional $1.8 billion of debt and equity financing, further strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capacity necessary to finance our capital spending plans over the next five years. As we look towards the back half of the fiscal year, we have more clarity around the regulatory outcomes, our O&M spending and our financing costs. This clarity gives us the confidence to tighten our EPS guidance range to $4.25 to $4.35, which leaves us well positioned to meet our earnings per share growth targets for fiscal 2019. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued outstanding efforts. Our highly qualified gas professionals come to work every day. Laser focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. They are accomplishing these critical services, while striving to improve every day as we deliver safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service to the nearly 3.3 million customers we serve and over 1,400 communities and our 8 state footprint. We certainly appreciate your time this morning, and we'll take any questions you may have. Kevin?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Christopher Turnure: So I wanted to make sure we were understanding kind of the equity situation correctly. Going back to last fall, my understanding was, you guys priced around $750 million of equity, a $150 million of which had a forward component to it that your message was you would pull down before I think the first half of fiscal '20. And then separately you had a forward component to a $500 million ATM. So what exactly occurred this quarter and kind of when is that going to hit your share count?
Christopher Forsythe: Right. And so Chris backing up to November, it was $748 million total equity issuance, of which, $500 million before costs were taken into the first quarter, $245 million was allocated to forward sales arrangements that expire in March of 2020. And our plan was to draw down the $245 million between January of 2019 and March 31 of 2020. When we had the opportunity presented to us that was unplanned when we moved to the S&P 500 in February, we issued $160 million under our ATM, under forward sales arrangements. So we have a total of $404 million in total forward arrangements available to us through the end of March of 2020. And we'll take that down over that next - basically over the next 11 months to 12 months based on our cash needs. But again, all of us have been contemplated in our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target for fiscal '19 and in the five-year plan and the - net forward - the forward arrangements that we took out in February are going to be applied against our fiscal 2020 equity needs, it will not be dilutive to fiscal '19.
Christopher Turnure: I think I understand now. But there's still a lot in there. So the amount that you did in February was simply priced under the forward ATM and you do not intend to pull that down during fiscal 2019 and you are still kind of leaving the forward component of the $750 million from November as - you're not specifying when you pull that down?
Christopher Forsythe: That's correct. Yes, we'll certainly start in the - towards the end of fiscal '19, the exact amount will be - to be determined based on our cash flow projections and cash needs.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And...
Christopher Forsythe: But we have to utilize all of those equity need - all of that equity by the end of - March of 2020, because the forward sales arrangements expire March 31st of 2020.
Christopher Turnure: And then, your comment on these actions covering you through fiscal 2020 so I want to make sure that I'm understanding properly. You're committing that there will be no more equity issuances in the kind of normal course of business.
Christopher Forsythe: Admitting that we will not have a discrete equity needs such as a large scale block trade that we've done the last couple of years with the ATM remains available to us and we intend to consider using that as we go forward as part of our overall financing strategy and needs, honestly. You think back to our five-year plan that we rolled out last fall, we have $5 billion to $6 billion of incremental financing needs and we intend to satisfy those needs through a balance of long-term debt and equity. And so we're still executing towards that plan.
Christopher Turnure: That's pretty clear. And then I guess just as a second question, you mentioned gas basis in Texas is helping you guys at least a little bit here. Can you give us more detail on how you're thinking about that over the next 6 months or 12 months, I think you said that you were making some preparations there in some way?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, that's correct. In the summer months as you know, Chris we have to reduce the pressure on the pipeline for maintenance work to get ready for winter operations. So we don't have as much opportunity to take advantage of those spreads. We do see some modest uptick, but between the fact that the pressure is going to be coming down on the system for maintenance work and the fact that we have Rider REVs in place, where we always share in 25% of that upside. We do, like I said, we do anticipate a modest uptick that we've contemplated in our guidance, but we don't anticipate that to be all that material in the grand scheme of things.
Michael Haefner: And Chris as you look into 2020, the expectation is the Gulf Coast Express is expected to be in service in the October-November timeframe. So we expect that to begin affecting spreads in the 2020 timeframe. And the key is that, our customers are benefiting from lower cost gas and then also through the Rider REV mechanism with - in terms of their transport costs, gas costs.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is now live.
Charles Fishman: Just going back to the equity. Your guidance, the average diluted shares goes down a little bit. The net income guidance for '19 went down a little bit on the upper end. But correct me if I'm wrong, what happened basically was, you went out for the equity you needed and were able to get it a little better pricing and then that drove your diluted shares down or is it just a later - are you issuing them at a later date, what basically drove the average diluted share quantity down?
Christopher Forsythe: Generally pricing.
Charles Fishman: That's what I would have assumed. Okay. Second question, operational. Certainly a tragic event in Boston in the fall. Final report isn't in, but it sounds like a low pressure event, that utility is putting in low pressure sensing devices through their whole system. Is that something you already have? Is that something you're doing? Is that something you will be doing or what's the status as far as the Atmos System with respect to low pressure sensing?
Michael Haefner: No - it's a good question, Charles and I mean, we operated in our low pressure systems. I mean, for a long time and we're constantly working on them. As Chris mentioned, we have been pretty proactive in terms of doing a full system evaluation design evaluation and we've kind of reaffirmed and reviewed all of our procedures, re-communicated them, we've created geo-fencing in our GIS systems. So when there our line locates calls that are anywhere near a low pressure systems, we'll have individuals from the Company there to monitor any construction or digging in near our assets and then this review of our system design will then guide our next set of actions which may involve bifurcating those systems or providing, putting other kind of technical solutions like slam shut devices or additional releases on based on the needs. So we're well along that process and we expect that we haven't seen anything that concerns us at this time.
Charles Fishman: But I suspect that technology is rapidly changing on this stuff. But do you have some device or some way of sensing a low pressure event that has occurred or - excuse me, I guess was a high pressure event in Boston, I had it backwards. Do you have the capability of sensing that now and most of your system?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, since the - I mean, since the designs were put in - the systems were put in over a longer period of time, there are various solutions to that, but yes, we have pressure sensors, we have pressure release devices as well. So we've got that type of protection in the system and what we're doing now is just going back through and doing a comprehensive review and seeing it, there are other interim or other steps we should take as it relates to low pressure.
Charles Fishman: Yes, I guess the events that really drive you nuts is a contractor doing work that has nothing to your people, but obviously that contractor could do something stupid that creates a problem for you and that's, I would assume as an ongoing issue that you'd have to address.
Michael Haefner: Yes, certainly the 70% of our hazardous leaks or calls by third-party damage. It's a very significant focus of our efforts and advocacy and it will continue to be and as I mentioned for the low pressure systems, we've taken the steps to geo-fence them in this electronically within our GIS system, so that as line locates coming in, if we have anybody work in near those systems we're going to have somebody monitoring it.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Mr. Byrd, perhaps your phone is on mute, please pickup your handset...
David Arcaro: Sorry about that. Hi, this is Dave Arcaro for Stephen Byrd. Thanks for taking my question. Let's see, had a quick question, so I was wondering, just if there, what are your latest thoughts following some of the commentary coming out of the Dallas City Council over the last couple of days with the rate request there, does that change any - your views of the overall process for that rate request?
Michael Haefner: Yes, I think what we're seeing is a normal part of the process, Dave. I mean, earlier this year, we filed the $10.1 million rate increase request in accordance with the annual mechanism, we agreed to early in 2017, that request is on the City Council agenda today. City staff, we've been working with them and their consultants and representatives and they've acknowledged the efforts on both sides and try to reach an agreement. However, we haven't been able to do so in time for their needed approvals. So the staffs recommended that the City Council denied the request. Now that denial would trigger an appeal process to the Railroad Commission which we've been down that path before and our plans to continue to work with the city, we share common interest certainly on replacing aging infrastructure and we've been investing for many, many years in Dallas and we expect to reach the agreement in some point in time in the future. Our Company has made a $119 million of infrastructure improvements in the City of Dallas during that test year and we also agreed to accelerate our cast iron replacement at the city's request to 2021 and getting the last that remove in 2021 versus 2023. So maybe a longer answer than you were looking for but it's - I think, we're continuing to have discussions and we'll continue to move down the path to try to find a win-win solution.
David Arcaro: And I was just wondering your latest thoughts on expectations for the NTSB process?
Michael Haefner: Sure. We don't have much of an update, that the core of engineers completed soil samples, they are requested in the area, they were requested to do that by the NTSB and then a public release in late February or early March, the NTSB indicated that they are finding a fact or factual report would be expected in June that - so that's the next step that would come from them and that would not at that time include any probable cause or safety recommendations, those will be sometime later and there is no timeframe on them. In the meantime, we continue to work with the NTSB and we continue to move forward on improvements in our processes around safety and then our safety investment in our systems so.
David Arcaro: And then maybe one last question. Wanted to clarify on the increased O&M expected this year for some of the low pressure system investments, I was wondering how you anticipated getting recovery of those investments, it sounds like that's anticipated, but does that flow through mechanisms or how do you think about that?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, we will seek to recover those costs maybe annual mechanisms that we have in the various jurisdictions. Again, it's safety-related. And I think everyone has got a keen eye on what happened last fall and all of our regulators have a commitment to safety and we would seek to recover those costs in our next round of filings.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Brian Levine from Citi. Your line is now live.
Brian Levine: Just to follow-up on the Permian Waha Katy places movements, is there a way to quantify exactly what the impact was for the first quarter or for the first calendar quarter given your sharing mechanism?
Christopher Forsythe: In the first calendar quarter. So year-over-year, we're up about $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter we're up about $1 million. So it was about $3.5 million in the first quarter year-over-year - quarter-over-quarter last fiscal year - I'm sorry, last quarter.
Brian Levine: And then in terms of going into the second quarter, are you seeing that directionally move up relative to this past quarter?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes. As we look into our third and fourth fiscal quarters I mean we do see the opportunity for a modest uptick in the - in those spreads. But as I indicated, with the maintenance work that we have planned for the pipe - the summer, combined with the effect of the Rider REV mechanism and how we share - 75% of that upside benefit flows back to the tariff customers on APT, we expect that to - that impact to be modest for us.
Brian Levine: And then last question. To the extent that you're able to comment, is there any update on the Georgetown incident?
Michael Haefner: Sure, and let me - for others on the call, with the Georgetown situation is pretty much behind us right now. It goes back to February 20th and there was a leak reported. We responded and identified two leaks and repaired those leaks and then what we identified was residual gas in the soil that had migrated and that led us to evacuate up to at a peak 85 structures that affected approximately 140 combined businesses and residents. And then we worked on getting that residual gas out of the soil. So all the evacuations have been listed except for one business and during this process, we provided financial support and we've been processing any claims for affected businesses and residences. We've got business interruption in insurance we believe will cover any cost that they get into that territory and we don't expect the impact. So we don't expect the impact to be material on the year, but that's largely behind us and I'll tell you about our team did, just an absolutely phenomenal job of responding to the situation there, working with the community and with all the regulators and city and state leaders.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Dennis Coleman from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Dennis Coleman: This maybe a question that has a little more detail than this now, I'm happy to take it offline if you would like. But I'm wondering there's quite a big swing in cash flow and I'm sort of working through the various statements trying to figure out where this is coming from. But is there a simple explanation we said drop of close to $200 million in cash flow for the six months?
Christopher Forsythe: Virtually all of that is the timing of the - of our deferred gas cost recoveries. We were somewhat over-recovered last year and we began working that balance down, returning those monies back to customers through the PGA and that continued into this year. So that - that's virtually all of the decrease. And that was planned as we moved into fiscal '19.
Dennis Coleman: So that's all encompassed in the financing plans and whatnot.
Christopher Forsythe: Exactly.
Dennis Coleman: So that will sort of this - the 2019 run rate is more of what we should expect...
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, it should level out now that after we kind of got into a situation where last year, we just moved a lot of volumes because it was cold and this happens to us from time to time under those PGA mechanisms in every jurisdiction got a different time period in which those rates are reset and so we're just working through that standard process. So we should be back to more on the call the day quote-unquote normal run rate going forward.
Dennis Coleman: And then just to make sure I understand the equity forwards. Are you able to do sort of 5s and 10s on this, are there - does that have to be discrete draws or is there one-time mechanism and does - are there any differences in that regard or the $106 million related to the S&P 500 move versus the prior forward?
Christopher Forsythe: Well, there are couple of things. We issued the forwards in February under the ATM program. So - and we could - you can go out and issue shares on a daily basis, if you want. In the past where we've executed what I would call more of a regular way of the issuance where we were taken those shares and it would become diluted daily as we move forward. This forward - or the ATM program that we stood out last fall, we added a forward feature to it and that gives us the ability to access the market on a daily basis and then basically allocate those shares under forward arrangements. So it could be a daily, it can be around an unplanned liquidity event like we did in February. It's all subject to the average daily trading volumes in kind of what and how ATM programs generally works. So we don't have any specifics around. We have to target this, we've to target that. We'll just - we look the market conditions and we'll take advantage for our pricing as we see it.
Dennis Coleman: But when you actually call for the cash, are there any limits in that regard?
Christopher Forsythe: No. The only limit we have is that, we have to utilize all of the forwards and all of that cash of those net proceeds under those arrangements by March 31 of 2020 when those arrangements expire.
Operator: And we reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you for joining us today. A recording of this call is available for a replay on our website through August 8, 2019. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and again, thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for. This call is being webcast live on the internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 21 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.  Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO at Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings of $158 million, a $1.38 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $152 million or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding $152 million, a $1.49 per diluted share benefit as a result of implementing tax reform last year. Also, yesterday, the board of directors approved the 141st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.525, which represents an indicated annual dividend of $2.10 per share for fiscal 2019, an 8.3% increase over fiscal 2018. Slides 4 and 5 provided details of the quarter-over-quarter changes to operating income for our distribution and pipeline storage segments. I'll touch on a few of the highlights. Contribution margin in our distribution segment grows a net 1% or about $4 million, strong consumption driven by colder weather in October and November when most of weather normalization mechanisms were not yet in effect, contributing an incremental $7.7 million.  Weather was 20% colder quarter-over-quarter with most of our service areas experiencing colder-than-normal conditions. Solid customer growth continued, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, although in the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 36,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. This growth contributed an incremental $3.7 million of contribution margin. The implementation of tax reform into customer bills more than offset rate increases that were implemented in the prior fiscal year and the first quarter, resulting in net $7.3 million decrease in customer rates. However, this had no material impact to the segment's net income as a result of the corresponding reduction in our effective income tax rate. Operating expenses rose 3.5%. Higher employee-related costs, depreciation and ad valorem tax expenses drove this increase.  In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased about $9 million. About 2/3 of this increase relates to new rates that were implement approved in the prior fiscal year through APT's 2 GRIP filings. Additionally, stronger transportation margins contributed incremental $3.1 million, net of the impact to -- of our Rider REV mechanism as APT continues to benefit from wider spreads. The supply and demand dynamics in the Permian basin combined with colder weather drove a 12% increase in transportation volumes. Operating expenses for this segment increased $11 million or almost 20%. This increase is focused on pipeline integrity work and reflects the timing of these activities. In the current year quarter, APT accelerated some hydrostatic testing that new client provided this fiscal year. In the prior year quarter, pipeline integrity work that had been planned for the first quarter was deferred later into fiscal 2018, resulting in a lower-than-normal expense for that quarter.  Additionally, depreciation and ad valorem taxes grow year-over-year due to last year's capital spending. Consolidated capital spending increased 8.7% to $416 million, about 82% of the spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Colder wet weather in some of our service areas created challenging conditions, which delayed some projects. However, we benefit from having over 6,000 relatively small projects each year that allow us to quickly reallocate our spending when we face these types of challenges. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion for the year.  From the financing perspective, we had a very busy quarter, as we completed $1.35 billion in debt and equity financing. And early October, we completed a successful $600 million, 30-year public debt issuance at an interest of 4.3%. The net proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. In late November, we issued approximately $750 million of equity. The offering included an equity forward arrangement that will remain in place through March of 2020. At contemplation of the offering, we've received approximately $495 million in net proceeds and allocated the remaining $245 million to the forward.  As of December 31, 2018, we had not accessed the net proceeds allocated to forward. At this time, we anticipate the net proceeds from this issuance will satisfy our equity needs for fiscal 2019. Additionally, in November, we filed a new $500 million at-the-market equity issuance program that will support our equity needs beyond fiscal 2019. As a result of these financing activities, our equity to total capitalization was 59%, and we had no short-term debt at quarter-end. We can consider the $218 million in cash on hand at the end of December, we have approximately $1.8 billion in total equity available to support our capital spending program. After an exceptionally busy year, in fiscal 2018, we completed our fiscal -- we expect our fiscal 2019 regulatory calendar to return to a more traditional cadence. To date, we've implemented $21 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and have about $38 million in progress. General rate cases in Kentucky and for about 15% of our Texas customers and annual filings for TransLa service area in Louisiana, the City of Dallas and Tennessee highlight the key filings that are currently in progress. We continue to implement tax reform into customer bills with completion of our Mississippi and Tennessee annual filings during the first quarter. Virginia, as the last date, we have not yet incorporated the effects of tax reform into our rates, but our general rate case currently in progress will address tax reform. We're now focused on finalizing the refund periods for our excess deferred taxes. Slide 20 details the progress we have made on tax reform to date.  In summary, we're off to a solid start to the fiscal year. We remain on track to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share.  I will now turn the call over to Mike, for some closing remarks.
Michael Haefner: Well, thank you, Chris, for the update on the quarter. And it was a very good quarter, and thank you, for those of you, who are joining us this morning. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we're off to a very good start to the year. We remain on track to meet our investor -- investment spending goals and our earnings growth targets. The 8.7% increase in capital spending during the first quarter demonstrates our team's consistent, predictable execution of our safety investment strategy. In order to sustain this strategy for the long term, which includes increasing our capital spending from $9 billion, over the past 10 years, to go in $9 billion to $10 billion over the next 5 years, our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. In the first quarter, we began rolling out new advanced asset data collection technology to field employees and contractors. During construction, crews will collect GPS locations, material, construction methods, operator qualification data for newly constructed pipeline. This will transform the process of asset data collection, data verification, project closings and the transfer of that key data to back-end systems that are used to support operations, maintenance, damage prevention, integrity management and our compliance programs. With thousands of capital projects completed each year, innovations like this that lie at the intersection of emerging technology, business process change and most importantly, our employees, are certainly game changers on our safety journey. This rollout will continue through this year 2019 and also through 2020.  This transformational technology is the one example of the many initiatives underway inside the company to scale our capabilities, capture efficiencies and enable our very talented employees to do what they do best, which is investing in safety and serving our customers and members of the community exceptionally well.  We're also taking huge steps forward in methods of communicating with key stakeholders. In the first quarter, we implemented interactive project maps for all of our service areas that are displayed on our company's website and show current and recently completed pipe replacement projects, giving our customers and other stakeholders' access to status updates about projects in their communities right down to the street level. For larger projects, we now develop customized websites, conduct door-to-door visits, send out mailings and use other channels, as needed, to most effectively reach our customers. And we're beginning to publish annual operating reports for our regulators and also community leaders. And we meet with officials in the cities we serve to keep them informed of our pipe replacement activity.  In December, we issued our first corporate responsibility report under the title of an Integrated Annual Report. We also published our first methane emissions report. Keeping key stakeholders informed, the company actions supporting our long-term commitments to good governance, our employees, customers, the 1,400 communities we serve and the environment.  I want to share some of the highlights from these reports. We adhere to strong corporate governance practices including a focus on thought diversity at the board. Women now hold more than 20% of our board seats, and 3 or 4 directors who joined the board since 2016 are female or minorities. And this year, the board will further strengthen corporate governance by forming a new board committee to oversee the company's corporate responsibility and sustainability.  And our pursuit to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we know that equipping employees with the training tools and support they need to operate safely and contribute at the highest level essential to our success. Employees received more than 53,000 hours of safety training last year and more than 73,000 hours of hands-on technical training in the state-of-the-art Charles K. Vaughan training center in Plano, which is a site of more than 850,000 hours of training since its opening. In part due to this training, the OSHA rate of recordable employee injuries has decreased 23% since 2013.  Over the past five years, employees also benefited from more than $1 million in higher education assistance received through the company's Robert W. Best Education Assistance Program. Employees continue to reach new heights in delivering exceptional customer service giving customers more options and convenience when initiating service, calling about a bill or making a payment arrangement. A new Spanish language account center was implemented in the past quarter as well as intelligent call routing technology that anticipates customers' needs and connects them with the most qualified agents.  And our customers tell us they like what they see. 96% of our customers are satisfied or very satisfied with their interactions with our contact center agents and 97% are satisfied or very satisfied with our on-site technicians. The company contributed $6.1 million to charitable organizations last year and that includes $2.7 million that went to help customers in need to our Energy Assistance Program. We're also working with 400 community support organizations to give low income families access to federal home energy assistance funds. But I am particularly proud of the contributions our Atmos Energy employees make in the communities, in which they operate. Last year, employees contributed $700,000 during our week of giving campaign and volunteered more than 35,000 hours of their own time to help their community. Also highlighted in the report is the work our team does to protect the environment, which has always been important to our company, our employees, our customers and the communities. As a founding member of the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, we work proactively to improve efficiency and reduce methane emissions. Since 2012, we've replaced over 3,500 miles of pipe, and we've decreased total emissions due to the use and loss with natural gas by 13.7% in our system. Over the next 5 years, we plan to replace between 5,000 and 6,000 miles of pipeline including all remaining cast iron by 2021, 2 years earlier than originally planned and between 200,000 and 300,000 field service lines. This will reduce methane emissions another 10% to 15%. As we continue to replace infrastructure, we set a goal to reduce our system's methane emissions by 50% by 2035. In addition to pipeline replacement, we're protecting the environment in other ways. In 2018, we completed our 9th LEED-certified service center and we have 4 more underway. Over 40% of our customers has signed up for electronic billing, one of the highest percentages in the industry, resulting in savings of approximately 152,000 pounds of paper every year. And we partner with municipal solid waste landfill gas producers to transport renewable natural gas to market. And for safety and to best serve our customers, we review and incorporate state-of-the-art equipment for leaks detection, monitoring and leak repair prioritization, including the use of 11 advanced mobile leak production technology units that are 1,000x more sensitive than traditional technologies.  In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service for the nearly $3.3 million customers we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8-state footprint. They come to work every day, focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our system and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your time this morning. We're off to a good start for the year.  And now we'll take any questions you may have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan.
Christopher Turnure: It was helpful that you quantify the impact of wider basis spreads at APT on the quarter. Certainly, good to see that number. It's difficult to do, but could you maybe take a crack at talking about how sustainable that might be throughout 2019 and maybe into 2020?
Michael Haefner: Chris, good morning, by the way, and thanks for being on and for your question. As we've said in the past, it's difficult to predict really beyond the current quarter. We do know that there is additional pipeline capacity expected to come on into service at the end of calendar year. And so we would expect that, that would normalize pricing a little bit. And as you know and a lot of our transport opportunities are opportunistic, as we serve primarily our firm supply customers, which would be the LDCs in our -- on system industrials. And as we get into the summer months, as we saw in the last -- or summer -- last summer, we do an awful lot of maintenance on the pipeline when we're in the off-peak season. So we're not going to get into the prediction for the rest of the year. We're happy we gotten off to a good start and had this opportunity. And again, as you know and others know, that three quarters of any benefits beyond the Rider REV benchmark flow back to our care of customers, which is -- creates yet another opportunity to keep customers' bills low.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. So at least for the first quarter, fair to say, that you're running a little bit ahead of maybe the plan that you had introduced back in November?
Michael Haefner: Yes.
Christopher Forsythe: Yes.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And then switching gears. I believe, legislation was introduced or at least was being discussed in Texas, to increase oversight of the Railroad Commission. Could you give us any thoughts you have on that, maybe probability of success there, what that might entail or any other legislation that you're keeping your eyes on this session?
Michael Haefner: Yes. Chris, there is -- each legislative session, there is legislation that is advanced. And we engage with those legislators, as we are here in Texas. I think, in Texas, this time, it's gotten a little more publicity. But, I mean, the starting point is we all share the same objective, which is pipeline safety and also further acceleration or acceleration of our infrastructure modernization and aging infrastructure replacement. So we don't -- we expect -- we're in discussions right now, trying to find good solutions that are supportive of our strategy and also meet the interest of all other parties. But, again, the general theme is focused on accelerated replacement of infrastructure, which we have been doing and certainly continue to. And then also more visibility and transparency around leak, as leaks appear and mapping of those leaks in Texas, as you may know, we refile every 6 months a leak report with the Railroad Commission and it provides an awful lot of that information. But I think the net of it is, it's very early in the session right now. And, I mean, we're pretty confident at this point in time that things will progress under normal pace and not have any significant impact to it.
Operator: Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Incorporated.
Charles Fishman: Two questions. First, and it's probably my misunderstanding. I thought, in the Dallas settlement, you had agreed to a 50% equity cap. And yet I notice on Slide 12, you're requesting the 60%. Is that just -- was that just for that 1 settlement last year? Or I guess, my understanding was that what you were going to use going forward, but, obviously, that's not the case. Can you talk about that?
Christopher Forsythe: Sure, Charles. This is Chris. Yes. When we reached at the settlement with the City of Dallas last February, we agreed to reduce our ROE down to 9.8% and increase the equity cap up to 58%. So that's where we are. We also had a similar cap with our Mid-Tex and West Texas RRM mechanisms in Texas that we established about a year ago at this time. So at this point -- and we do have a 15% of our customers, as I mentioned, where we have a stated intent in progress, they're currently at 10.5% and 55% ROE. We are currently preparing to go to Austin, in the first step part of March to have that case heard out at this point. But -- and settlement discussions are still ongoing. But the lion share of the state, as we've said, at 98 -- 9.8% equity -- or ROE and 58% equity cap.
Charles Fishman: Okay. But maybe I'm still misunderstanding this. On Slide 12, if I look at the first two filings, one, the filings ones you intent to file. You show an authorized capital structure on the third bullet point on each one of 60% equity. So how does -- why is that 60%? And then it was 58% before.
Christopher Forsythe: Right. Yes. The requested capital structure is -- under the law, we had to file based on where we ended the test year-end. So we ended it right at 59.7% with all the financing activities that we had in the quarter. So that will just be a point of discussion when we go through the process. And we're actually beginning to close the discovery process right now.
Charles Fishman: So it sounds like the 58% is not really a hard cap, it's subject to discussion at each round?
Christopher Forsythe: Generally, we try to hear the terms, but given where we were at the end of -- at the test year-end, we had to file based on where our equity capitalization was. And remember, City of Dallas is on a 13-month average as well. So it looks a little bit different vis-à-vis at the test year-end of September 30. So -- and we will get it worked out and the negotiations.
Charles Fishman: Okay. Second question, I noticed on the queue that regulatory excess deferred taxes, let's say, they were $740 million at the end of your '18 fiscal year. They are now at about $718 million, so a $22 million drop during the quarter. I realize Virginia is not in there yet and I realize every jurisdiction has little different amortization schedule. But is that, from a modeling standpoint, as an analyst, that was $22 million, maybe $25 million per quarter is how we'll see that liability going down over the next few years? Is that reasonable?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, that sounds about right. I mean, if you go to Slide 20, if you want to try to get a little bit more details in terms of modeling, we have provided the provisional amortization periods by jurisdiction. And if you wanted to get into approximation of the excess deferred taxes by jurisdiction, you can kind of do it somewhat pro rata based upon our rate base and then you can use the amortization periods, provided on Slide 20, to the deck, to help with the modeling on that. Again, it's really difficult right now to -- it's being folded in jurisdiction by jurisdiction. For example, as I mentioned, Mississippi and Tennessee just started, the Tennessee was in mid-October, Mississippi was in the first of November, West Texas and Mid-Tex RRMs were in October, so I understand the modeling could be a little bit challenging. But I think the information on Slide 20 is ought to give you a pretty good indication of how that's going to flow back. And at the end of the day with -- it's actually fully implemented and embraced, we expect our customers to benefit more than $125 million per year. So that's inclusive of the 21% rate as well as the flow back of the excess deferred taxes.
Charles Fishman: I'm probably too lazy to do it jurisdiction by jurisdiction. I guess, I was looking for an easy way out. But it sounds like if I do like $100 million per year realizing that once we get Virginian in there, that's probably close?
Christopher Forsythe: And Virginia is very small. I -- so if you do the $740 million, it's about $25 million , that may be a good way to start, if you're doing some high-level model.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi.
Ryan Levine: Would you be able to comment on the current labor availability within your service territory? And that's -- how that's evolved over the last few quarters? And if there's any [indiscernible] governor to some of the acceleration of the CapEx programs?
Michael Haefner: Yes, I mean, it's a good question and it's something that we've commented around before. We haven't seen a change in the labor market in the last year or so. But it is a constraint for us that we are growing and working with our contractors, so that they can grow their crews. And big issue is not just finding people, but it's people with appropriate qualification to work on our system safely. I mean, we've kind of baked in what we think they're capable of doing in our estimates in terms of pipe replacement that we're able to complete each year, and that's something that we watch very closely. But again, we haven't -- it is a constraint. We factored it into our plans. We believe, we have. And we haven't really seen a change in those mark conditions kind of year-over-year. So we're pretty comfortable right now with what we're seeing.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And then second question, is there any update that you're able to communicate around the NTSB investigations and the time line for any type of conclusion?
Michael Haefner: Really, there is nothing new for us. I mean, we initially expected the factual report, which would be the first piece that would come out to be somewhere in the end of this first calendar quarter or second calendar quarter. But with the government shutdown, we're not sure what the impact that will have on that. I know they got pretty backed up and there were a number of other investigations that they've had to start up once they got back. So we really don't have any information either way. And -- but, again, the sequence is a factual report typically will come out and then sometime after that would be there safety recommendations.
Ryan Levine: Okay. So this is considered a nonessential government agency. So this is safe to assume that no work was done during the shutdown?
Michael Haefner: Yes.
Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I would like to... go head, Jenn.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. A recording of this call is available for a replay on our website through May 9, 2019. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-11-08 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jennifer Hills - Vice President of Investor Relations Christopher Forsythe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Haefner - President and Chief Executive Officer
Analysts:
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy 2018 Fourth Quarter Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Hills. VP - Investor Relations.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 23 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer; and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $444 million or $4 per diluted share compared with $382 million or $3.60 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations excludes a $159 million or $1.43 per diluted share benefit from the revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of tax reform. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose $46 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $36 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the prior year period. These results exclude a $7 million or $0.06 per diluted share shrewd out to the one-time benefit from implementing tax reform after the IRS clarified the implementation day of the new capital extensive rules in August.  Our fiscal 2018 results were above the midpoint of our updated guidance range representing 16 consecutive year earnings per share growth. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch a few on the fiscal year highlights. Contribution margin in our distribution segment rose a net 4.6% or about $64 million year-over-year.  Rate increases driven by increased capital spending related to safety and reliability improvements, providing incremental $71 million, about 85% of these increases were in North Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi service areas in line with contribution to our portfolio of assets. We also continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 34,000 customers, a 1.1% increase for the year. And our transportation margins increased 15% year-over-year.  In addition to adding customers to the system, several other our existing customers, transportation customers increased their consumption either through plant expansions or increased business activity due to the short filing. Virtually all of this increase occurred in our Kentucky/Mid-States and Texas service areas. Combined, this growth added $17 million in contribution margin for the year. These increases were partially offset by a $51 million decline in revenue, due to the implementation of tax reform. This decline was essentially offset by a corresponding decline in income tax expense. Operating expenses rose approximately 10% year-over-year. We increased our pipeline and storage activities and experienced higher line locate expense surveys and other employee-related costs. Additionally, we incurred $24 million of expense associated to planned outage in Northwest Dallas during the second quarter. In our pipeline and storage segment, contribution margin increased to net $51 million or 11.2%. Revenue increased $74 million from rate activity due to full year impact of new rates in APT's most recent rate case completed last August combined with increases associated with two quick filings that were approved during the fiscal year. The implementation of tax reform produced revenue by about $24 million. Operating expenses increased $31 million or 13%. This increase was in line with expectations with the majority of the increase related to depreciation resulting from higher capital spending. Consolidated capital spending for fiscal 2018 increased 29% to nearly $1.5 billion, which is above our original expectation of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, about 85% of our fiscal 2018 spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects. Earlier in the fourth quarter, we filed an amended pipe replacement plan for our Mid-Tex Division for the remainder of calendar 2018. It outlined plans to accelerate our pipeline replacement activities. Most of the higher replacement plan spending was incurred in connection with this updated plan. In fiscal 2018, we remained very active from a regulatory perspective. We implemented approximate $80 million of annualized operating income increases from 18 regulatory proceedings. We also completed three proceedings, which should result in annualized operating income increase to $21 million. Rates from these three filings went into effect in October.  After taking into account the lower tax expense resulting from tax reform, the net financial impact for rate outcomes completed in fiscal 2018 was $120 million to $140 million, we anticipated. So far, in fiscal 2019, we completed filings in our Mississippi and Tennessee service areas, resulting in a $2 million increase in annualized operating income. These filings also helped to implement tax reforms in these states. Currently, we have six filings in progress taking about $14 million in annualized operating income and Slide 9 provides the additional detail around the regulatory activities for fiscal 2018 and the start of fiscal 2019. Tax reform provided unique opportunity to reduce customer builds and we won the first utilities in the country to inform that benefits to our customers. A significant amount of regulatory work issue was focused on reflecting the positive impact of cash reform in customer bills as quickly as possible. In seven of our eight states, we have adjusted rates to reflect the lower 21% statutory rate. Virginia is the only state where we have not yet adjusted rates of tax reform. However, we have a filing in progress that would address among other things tax reform that we have established regulatory liability effective January 1, 2018, for the difference in the new and former statutory rates. And three states we are returning the regulatory liabilities we established effective January 1st to account the difference between the former 35% statutory rate and the current 21% rate. And in six states, we're returning the excess deferred tax liability using provisional amortization periods ranging from 18 to 40 years. These periods would be trued up in future filings, once the filing terminations is made regarding the allocation of the excess deferred tax liabilities between the protective and non-protective components. The key take away from all this tax reform activity that we now have clarity around the implementation of tax reform into customer bills. We now estimate that the annual custom benefit from tax reform once fully implemented will be over $125 million per year. Slides 20 and 21 summarize the financial tax -- impacts of tax reform on our fiscal 2018 results and the progress we have made to implement tax reform in our rates. Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our capital spending program and returned to benefits of tax reform to our customers.  As of September 30, 2018, our equity to total capitalization was 57%, a 400 basis point increase from one year ago. The increase largely reflects the equity offering we completed last November and the recognition of the one-time benefit from tax reform. We had approximately $1 billion of borrowing capacity available under our credit facilities at fiscal year-end. On October 4, 2018, we completed successful $600 million 30-year public debt issuance and an all-in interest rate of 4.37%. The proceeds were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper. In LIBOR financial reforms for 2018, yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 140th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, a way to get into an indicated annual rate for fiscal '19 of $2.10 per share, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2018.  As we look forward to fiscal 2019, we expect earnings per share to be -- in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share and capital spending to range between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. The primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share is our continuing acceleration of the spending persistent to replacement and modernization.  We will provide additional detail on our financial outlook for 2019 when we work on our five-year plan through fiscal 2023 at our Investor Meeting in New York next Tuesday, November 13th. That meeting will also be webcast on our website. I would now turn the call over to Mike for some closing remarks.
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Chris, for that great update. As you can see from our fiscal 2018 results, it was another successful year where we met our financial targets driven by our proactive pipe replacement and system modernization investment. This year was not without its challenges. The tragic event that occurred in February continues to weigh heavily on our hearts as our leaders and employees continue to dedicate themselves to all aspects of safety. The unprecedented system performance we experienced in Northwest Dallas further reinforced our strategy of closely monitoring potential threats that may impact integrity of our system and also accelerating the replacement of aging infrastructure. The effort to replace 24 miles of distribution main and service line serving 2,400 customers in Northwest Dallas, which would normally take one year was completed safely in three weeks. We saw the very best from our employees, our contractor partners and the affected customers during that difficult period. And we learn new information about our system performance under various environmental operating conditions. With the support of our regulators, we're working to incorporate these findings into our risk models, our policies and our procedures. As Chris mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we announced plans to further accelerate our pipe replacement activities in our Mid-Tex Division. We're on track to double the work crews dedicated to pipe replacement activity in Dallas by the end of this calendar year. This increase is in addition to the 40 crews added earlier in the year, following the planned outage. With these additional crews, we intend, among other things, to perform an entire system replacement of a significant portion in Northwest Dallas by the end of 2019 to eliminate cash payment from the Mid-Tex distribution system by 2021. We are committed to operating safely and reliably, while we continue to modernize our natural gas distribution and transmission system. Across our eight states, in fiscal year 2018, our team completed more than 6,500 capital project, replacing more than 725 miles of distribution pipe, more than 150 miles of transmission pipe and 54,000 service lines. A significant accomplishment that was in line with expectations for transmission and above our expectations in distribution. Modernization of our system is a long-term effort. They have a proven track record of managing and growing these investments in a measured, safe and responsible manner. And all of these investments have delivered significant benefits to our customers, our communities, the economy in the states we operate and to our investors.  We continue to have the support of our regulators who understand the need to modernize and replace aging infrastructure. We have mechanisms in place that enable us to begin recovering on 85% of our capital investments within six months of the test year-end and 99% within 12 months. This enables us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate returns necessary to attract new capital needed to finance our investments. We have a very strong management team that's supported by an engaged Board of Directors. Last week, we announced that Sean Donohue and Diana Walters have been elected to our Board of Directors, effective November 1, 2018. Sean and Di bring deep experience in the management of public and private enterprises, will provide great value and thought diversity to our Board. We look forward to their leadership. And, yesterday, we announced the promotion of Kevin Akers to Executive Vice President. In addition to his current responsibilities, which include pipeline safety, customer service, supply chain management, facilities and our business process and chain management area, he'll now assume responsibility over the company's pipeline and storage operations through Atmos Pipeline-Texas that previously reported to me. Kevin's broad company and industry experience will serve him well as a member of our management team. He continues to expand his involvement in the development and execution of the company's operating and financial strategies. Next week, at our Investor Meeting, we'll present our updated five-year plans for fiscal 2023. Joining me will be Kevin as well as David Park, our Senior Vice President of Utility Operations and Chris Forsythe. Our strategy remains unchanged. We remain committed to meeting our goal of being updated natural gas provider.  We'll continue to focus our investments on infrastructure modernization, system modification, customer growth and deploying technology that can improve safety, drive efficiencies and support scale. These investments will enhance the value of our rate base, which is expected to slow down our continued earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts. They strive to find ways to improve every single day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service to our 3.2 million customers we serve and over 1,400 communities in our eight-state footprint. They come to work every day focused on safety, while providing excellent customer service, closely monitoring and maintaining our systems and executing our capital spending program. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. We appreciate your time this morning. And now, we'll take any questions that you may have. Dana?

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Hills. Thank you, please go ahead.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slides presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 30 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings and continuing operations of $71 million or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with $71 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the prior quarter year's third quarter. Year-to-date, earnings from continuing operations were $564 million or $5.09 per diluted share, compared with $347 million or $3.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Yeah-to-date results include a $166 million or $1.49 per diluted share non-recurring income tax benefit from Tax Reform. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations with major drivers underlying our performance during the first half of fiscal year continuing into the third quarter. Operating income in our distribution segment decreased $50 million to about $62 million in the third quarter, largely driven by $12 million decrease in contribution margin due to the implementation of Tax Reform. Contribution margin was positively impacted by regulatory actions which provided an incremental $11 million in contribution margin in the quarter. And we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment had a net 34,000 customers, which represents a 1.1% net customer growth. We also continue to add transportation customers to this system in our Kentucky/Mid-States Division. Combined, this growth added nearly $5 million in contribution margin for the quarter. Operating expenses rose approximately 11% quarter-over-quarter. We experienced a planned increase in pipeline integrity activities, higher volume locate costs, higher employee related cost and increased depreciation property tax expense resulting from our capital spending. We also incurred about $1.5 million in travelling expenses associated with the planned Northwest Dallas outage during the second quarter, bringing the total expenses associated with the events approximately $24 million. This particular product has been completed and we do not anticipate material future expenses associated with this event. Operating income in our pipeline and storage segment decreased by $2 million. Contribution margin increased a net $11 million, as we recognized $24 million of incremental margin from APT GRIP case completed last August and the accrual of two GRIP filings in fiscal 2018. This increase was partially offset by $8 million reduction in revenues due to the implementation of Tax Reform. Offsetting the growth in contribution margin was $13 million increase in operating expenses, as a result of higher depreciation related to increase capital expenditures and timing of planned pipeline integrity work. Consolidated capital spending for fiscal 2018 increased 34% to $1.1 billion which is in line with our expectations. 85% of our fiscal 2018 spending was focused on improving the safety and liability of our system. Based on work concluded today and plan for the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to expect our fiscal 2018 capital spending to approximately $1.4 billion. We've remained very active from a regulatory perspective. To date, we have completed 19 filings which add approximately $81 million in annualized operating income over fiscal 2018 and 2019 inclusive of defective Tax Reform. $71 million of this amount related to APT. And we had 9 filings pending seeking about $42 million in annualized operating income in our distribution segment. We anticipate most of these filings will be completed during the fourth quarter with rates taking effect during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. After taking to account, the lower tax expense we are incurring the net financial impact from these regulatory outcomes is consistent therefore we're anticipating at beginning of the fiscal year. Tax Reform has been a primary focus for a regulatory team during the third quarter and we emerge from the quarter with a lot of clarity in how Tax Reform will be reflected in customer bills. In final stage we have adjusted rates reflect the lower 21% rate. In three states, we start returning the regulatory liabilities we established effective January 1st, to account the difference between for former 35% statutory rate and the current 21% statutory rate. And the three states, we start to return exits of our taxes using conventional amortization period ranged from 18 to 40 years. These periods will be treat up in future filings. Looking forward, we expect to refund the regulatory liability in excess differed taxes for several of our taxes jurisdiction in October. And in November, we expect adjust rate in Mississippi and Tennessee for the full impact of Tax Reform. We are well in our way to fully implementing cash reforming and customer bills. Once fully implemented, we fully continue to estimate that the annual customer benefit from Tax Reform will be over $100 million. Slides 24 and 25 summarize the financial impact to Tax Reform for fiscal 2018 results and progress of 2018 in Tax Reform. Our balance sheet remained strong as our capital spending program and the return of the benefits of Tax Reform to our customers. As of June 30, our equity of sold capitalization was 59% and we got approximately $1.4 billion of borrowing capacity available under our credit facilities. As view to our final quarter of fiscal year, we remain on track to meet our fiscal 2018 earnings guidance range $3.84 to $4.05 per diluted share excluding the non-recurring benefit recognizing the implementation of Tax Reform. The higher than anticipated growth in economic activity we saw at the beginning of the year and the anticipated impact of Tax Reform is materializing as expected. Slide 27 provides legit information underlying our fiscal 2018 guidance. This information has not changed in the prior quarter. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn to President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Haefner for his closing remarks.
Michael Haefner: Chris, thank you very much for the great update on the quarter and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see from our third quarter results, we remained very focused and on track to meet our fiscal 2018 target driven primarily by our proactive pipe replacement and system modernization investment. Our commitment to safety is fair now. From 2011 to 2017, we invested approximately $6 billion on replacing 80 infrastructure and modernizing our system. And between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2022 we planned to spend an additional $8 billion with rate of capital investment growing approximately 11% per year on average. With over 80% of this spending will be focused on safety and reliability investments as it has been in the past. Our group dedicated employees are the reason for our continued success as we prefer our safety and service commitments to our customers and our communities where we life and work. We constantly strive to become a safest provider of natural gas services through our investments, not only in our infrastructure but also in our employees and the technology and business processes used to maintain and operate our system and in public safety awareness. For example, training hours in 2018 increased approximately 10% year-over-over with the majority of the training at our world-class training center going towards technical skills development and safety. And since third part damage is the number one cause of least in our system, we continue to raise public awareness through pipeline safety efforts. These efforts are paying off, reported injuries for employees are down 17% year-over-year and our fiscal 2018 damage rate is below the industry average and has been reduced approximately 20% of its last six years, request an increase by 50% over that same period. We continue to see strong economic development, we are really fortunate to serve some of the fastest growing regions in the country. The Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add 1.5 million households over 4 million people over the next 30 years. We stand ready to serve our communities as this demand grows. Our proven organic growth strategy driven by necessary safety and reliability investments along with consistent customer growth provides a very long time horizon of infrastructure needs ahead. Even with the significant investments we've made, the low and stable natural gas environment is help keep customers really affordable and our proactive approach to ensure customer receive the benefit of the lower federal tax rate that made customer build an even better value. Our regulators understand the need to increase the pace of pipeline replacement. The various annual rate review mechanisms and infrastructure mechanisms provide transparency for those regulators to annually review the progress we're making to modernize our system by also providing the opportunity we need to unreasonable returns that are investors required by the financial resources we need to sustain our effort. We've remained confident that all these factors will continue to provide a reasonable return to our investors through earnings per share and dividend growth in the 6% to 8% range each year. We are focused on the long run and the long term sustainability of our business and we are dedicated to all of our stakeholders. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding effort. They strive the fine ways to improve every day to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and exceptional natural gas service to our 3.2 million customers that we serve in over 1,400 communities in our 8 state footprint. They come to work every day focused on safety while providing excellent customer service and executing our capital spending program focused on modernizing our system. Our employees have a strong belief and striving to do the right thing without seeking recognition or awards. And is this attitude that drives us success. Recently Atmos Energy was named the 2018 Most Trusted Utility Brand in the South. This distinction was not even possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees. So thanks for each of you for what you do every day to Atmos Energy. While we appreciate the time this morning and now we'll take any questions that you may have. Back to you Brenda.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dennis Coleman with Bank of America.
Michael Haefner: Dennis, good morning.
Dennis Coleman: Good morning to all. Couple of quick ones for me. You still on or we still the guidance of 385 to 405 and sort of now we are down to one quarter ago, I wonder if you might just talk about what gets you to the higher end of that range or lower end of that range?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah, I think - Dennis, this is Chris. Good morning. You know as we look into the fourth quarter, we've got some plan that pipeline is ready to work, we take APTs outline, so that's a big project that started in early July. And so that's a variable. That right now with where we see things as of today we project to be somewhere middle of that guidance range at this point.
Dennis Coleman: Okay, okay. And then a couple more detailed questions on in the distribution segment, OpEx and tax expense were little higher than our estimate. I wonder if there is anything particular, now you did talk a little bit about that on Slide 5 but any additional comments you might make there.
Chris Forsythe: Yeah, on OpEx, I think it is seeing some timing, particularly employee cost, we had some key executive retired a year ago, so the settlement charges set up in the third quarter, not that material but that was you know one item that did flow through. With tax expense, you are talking profit taxes or you are talking…?
Dennis Coleman: Yeah, not income taxes.
Chris Forsythe: Yeah, profit taxes you know we are adjusting our estimates profit tax, we are mostly on a calendar basis. So as we are working through the valuation process with profit tax seem in various municipalities, we just make adjustments for the year and what we think our full calendar year expenses.
Dennis Coleman: Got it, got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Brenda. This concludes our call. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through November 8, 2918. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Good bye.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy 2018 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Hills, you may begin.
Jennifer Hills: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause some material differences are outlined on Slide 29 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our President and CEO, Mike Haefner, will begin our call with some opening comments. Mike?
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. During the quarter, we continued to successfully execute our investment and regulatory strategy focused on becoming the safest and most reliable natural gas utility in the country. This strategy, along with the exceptional dedication and effort on the part of our 4,600 employees, continues to benefit our customers in the form of improved reliability and service. We remain very well positioned for the future as we move through the seventh consecutive year of our journey to become the safest natural gas utility. Nothing is more important to our employees than the safety of our customers and communities. In late February, there were three gas-related incidents in Northwest Dallas, one of which resulted in the tragic death of a 12-year-old child. We're in direct contact with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Railroad Commission of Texas and are supporting a coordinated investigation into the incident. Soon after that and in the days leading up to March 1, we experienced a sudden and unexplained increase in leaks in a 1.5 square-mile area of our system in Northwest Dallas. To understand why a system that had been performing normally was suddenly performing in this way, we hired a geotechnical, engineering and forensics firm to assess the system.  Their preliminary assessment indicated an extraordinary combination of unique conditions, including geology, hydrology, soil conditions and record rainfall in this concentrated area caused differential ground movement that damaged our pipeline system. Their report further stated that this could not have been readily modeled, predicted, anticipated or foreseen. On March 1, we acted with the utmost of caution, made the decision to undertake a planned outage to accelerate the replacement of all mains, service lines and meters for approximately 2,400 customers in this area. We moved approximately 700 contractors temporarily from other pipe replacement projects and replaced all service lines in 124,000 feet of mains. This project, which would normally take a year, was completed in just over three weeks. While the system was being replaced, we provided financial assistance to the affected customers and incurred other project-related expenses totaling approximately $23 million. We're very grateful for the more than 500 of our employees, representing every department and division in our company, who worked selflessly around the clock on the accelerated replacement and customer assistance efforts and for all of our other employees, who provided back-office support to the effort while continuing to serve our other customers. The organization's rapid response and mobilization demonstrates the dedication of our employees and our commitment to safety and to our customers. We're also grateful for the tremendous support we received from the City of Dallas, Dallas Fire and Rescue, Dallas Police, the Office of Emergency Management and many other city services, as well as the affected customers, who were patient during this difficult time and were very welcoming to our employees and contractors working in their streets, alleys and homes. We remain committed to our pipeline integrity investment strategy across all jurisdictions in which we operate. Since 2011, we've invested approximately $6 billion on replacing aging infrastructure and modernizing our system. Our current capital investment plans are for an additional $8 billion to be invested over the next 5 years across our company. We've been growing our capital investment at a 10.5% compound annual growth rate, which is approximately 3.5x our depreciation rate. And we have plans to continue investing at that rate. Based on work completed in the first two quarters, as well as the planned projects for the remainder of the year, we now expect our fiscal 2018 capital spending to be approximately $1.4 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will now provide a financial update. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everybody. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings from continuing operations of $179 million or $1.60 per diluted share, compared with $162 million or $1.52 per diluted share in the prior year second quarter. Results from continuing operations included $4 million or $0.03 per diluted share noncash income tax benefit related to tax reform. Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ending March 31 were $493 million or $4.7 [ph] per diluted share compared to $276 million or $2.61 per diluted share in the prior year period. Results for the current six-month period included $166 million or $1.50 per diluted share nonrecurring income tax benefit from tax reform. Our second quarter results were driven by the contribution from recent rate activity due to continued increase in pipe replacement and other system modernization spending, strong consumption trends and higher operating expenses. Operating income in our distribution segment increased 7.5% to $210 million in the current quarter, due to a number of drivers.  Recovery from recent regulatory actions provided an incremental $28 million of contribution margin. Additionally, we experienced a more normal winter heating season this year, compared to last year's unseasonably warm weather. As a result, we experienced a $9 million quarter-over-quarter increase in residential and commercial consumption and a $15 million increase year-to-date. Additionally, weather-driven demand drove a $2 million increase in transportation revenues in our tax provisions. Finally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added net 36,000 customers, which represents 1.1% net customer growth. Additionally, we continue to add transportation customers to the system, primarily in our Kentucky/Mid-States Division. Combined, this growth added over $4 million in contribution margin for the quarter and up $7 million year-to-date. This growth in our contribution margin was partially offset by a $26 million decrease as we reflected a 21% statutory tax rate in our revenues beginning January 1, 2018. Additionally, we experienced an 18% increase in operating expenses due to the planned outage in Northwest Dallas, a planned increase in pipeline integrity activities and higher depreciation in property tax expense resulting from our capital spending. Moving to the pipeline and storage segment. Operating income increased about $1 million. Contribution margin increased about $9 million due to $17 million of incremental margin from APT's recent rate case and approval of a GRIP filing in December, partially offset by an $8 million reduction in revenues due to the implementation of tax reform. Additionally, during the quarter, APT continued to benefit from wider spreads between the Katy and Waha hubs. As a result, contribution margin increased $2 million for the quarter and approximately $3 million year-to-date net of the Rider REV adjustment. Given the supply and demand dynamics impacting the Permian Basin combined with stronger demand in the Barnett, Katy and Houston ship channel areas, we expect these trends to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. Offsetting this growth in contribution margin was an $8 million increase in operating expenses as a result of higher depreciation related to capital expenditures and the planned increase in pipeline integrity work. Consolidated capital spending increased almost 25% period-over-period to $694 million and was in line with our expectations. Over 80% of the spending was focused on improving the safety and reliability of our system. At this time, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made to implement tax reform. As a reminder, because of fiscal year starting October 1, 2017, our blended federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be 24.5%. It will decline to 21% beginning in fiscal 2019. As a result, our effective tax rate for the six months ending March 31 was 27.1%, excluding the one-time benefit and is expected to be the range of 26% to 28% for the fiscal year. During the second quarter, we continue to find the impact of tax reform in our balance sheet, and we recorded an additional $4 million income tax benefit. This brings the total nonrecurring income tax benefit from implementing tax reform to $166 million or $1.50 per diluted share. Additionally, we reduced the amount of excess deferred taxes that we've returned to customers by about $8 million. Our total excess deferred tax liability is now $738 million. During the quarter, we worked with the regulators to ensure that our utility customers receive the full benefit of tax reform in their gas bills. We have reached agreement with our regulators in Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas to reduce customer bills going forward to reflect the lower statutory federal rate. In Colorado and Kansas, new rates were implemented effective April 15 and April 1. And in Kentucky, customer bills were adjusted effective March 20. In Texas, we began phasing in the impact of lower taxes in customer bills in February and all customer bills reduced by April 1. Through the end of March, we've returned $5 million to customers, and we anticipate customers will realize annual savings of over $100 million from the lower federal tax rates. In our other four jurisdictions, tax reform is being addressed in connection with regulatory proceedings are currently in progress. Slides 22 and 23 provide additional detail on our progress towards implementing tax reform. Additionally, regulators in all of our jurisdictions have ordered us to record liabilities for the difference in our rates based in the form of 35% statutory federal income tax rate and the new 21% rate beginning January 1, 2018, until customer bills are adjusted. At the end of March, these liabilities approximated $29 million. Finally, with respect to the refund of excess deferred taxes, we have reached an agreement in Colorado to begin returning those liabilities on a conditional basis beginning June 1, 2018. In our other jurisdictions, we expect to address the treatment of this liability in our next annual or other future regulatory proceedings. As we discussed last quarter, we expect that the reduction in operating cash flow from fully implementing tax reform will increase our estimated financing needs for fiscal 2022 by $500 million to $600 million. Our balance sheet as of March 31 is strong and can support this incremental financing need. The total capitalization was 60%, and we had approximately $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity available under our credit facility. In closing, yesterday we reaffirmed our fiscal 2018 earnings guidance of $3.85 to $4.05 per diluted share, excluding the nonrecurring benefit recognized for the implementation of tax reform. Stronger-than-planned customer consumption in our distribution segment and transportation revenue trend in both the distribution and pipeline storage segments have increased our outlook for our contribution margins. And the associated cash flow has reduced our anticipated short-term borrowing needs in addition to an anticipated interest expense for the year. However, we're anticipating higher levels of O&M as a result of the planned outage in northwest Dallas and an anticipated increase in system monitoring and maintenance activities. Slide 25 provides additional detail related to our fiscal 2018 EPS guidance. Thank you for your time this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Mike for his closing remarks.
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Chris, for that update on the quarter. As you can see from our second quarter results, we remain focused and are on track to meet our fiscal 2018 targets, driven by our proactive pipe replacement and system modernization investments. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from recent regulatory outcomes, colder weather compared to the prior year and customer growth. We continue to invest in our infrastructure and are on track to spend approximately $1.4 billion this year. Our spending will continue to accelerate annually over the next four years with approximately 80% of that spending focused on safety and reliability. On the regulatory front, we've completed 11 filings, which should add approximately $47 million in annualized operating income over fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. And we have 11 filings pending, seeking over $91 million in annualized operating income, inclusive of the impact of tax reform. We remain well on our way to meet our targets for annual increases from implemented rate activity in fiscal 2018, including the impact of tax reform. In fact, the tax changes due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will lower the annual ratemaking results, but that impact will not affect the overall results of ratemaking on Atmos Energy's earnings. Slides 8 through 20 provide details about the progress we've made during fiscal 2018 and pursuing our regulatory strategy. Our key regulatory accomplishment during the second quarter was the renewal of several annual rate review mechanisms in Texas with constructive terms. These mechanisms cover approximately 80% of our distribution customers in Texas. In February, we successfully settled the outstanding statement of intent with the City of Dallas. As part of the settlement, we were able to begin reflecting the benefits of tax reform in customers' rates. We were also able to update the Dallas Annual Rate Review or DARR. Additionally, we refreshed the terms of the annual rate review mechanism or RRM for the largest coalition of cities in Mid-Texas [ph] and for the RRM cities in West Texas. The renewal of these Annual Rate Review Mechanisms underscores our regulator support for us to continue to replace pipe at an increasing pace. And these mechanisms provide transparency for regulators to annually review the progress we're making to modernize our system, while also providing the opportunity to earn the reasonable returns that our investors require to provide the financial resources we need to sustain our efforts. They have a long-time horizon of infrastructure investment needs ahead. The low natural gas price environment and now lower tax environment supports our continued investment in the safety and reliability of our system, while keeping customers' bills very affordable. We remain confident that our pipe replacement programs will continue to provide a reasonable return to our investors through earnings per share and dividend growth in the 6% to 8% range each year. We appreciate your time this morning and look forward to meeting with those of you who will be joining us later this month at the AGA Financial Forum in Phoenix. And now, we'll take any questions you may have.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Turnure: Good morning Mike and Chris. I wanted to get an understanding of the NTSB investigation, the potential timing of an outcome now that we have the preliminary reports and any other open investigations that might be out there or your knowledge of any of those that might be forthcoming?
Mike Haefner: Yes, good morning Chris. As you know, the NTSB issued a preliminary report on March 23, confirming that they've done site inspections, collected records and materials. They also interviewed our personnel and other first responders. And we understand it could be months before a factual report is issued, and we expect a final report from them in the 2019 calendar year time frame. There are no other investigations underway from the NTSB at this time.
Chris Turnure: Okay. And from the NTSB report that would be upcoming here in months, and then I guess, the final one, at some point next year, would you expect a determination of cause and any determination of fault within that?
Mike Haefner: That's a good question, Chris. First of all, just I want to remind everyone that NTSB is an independent agency and the board has no regulatory authority. Its whole focus is on improving safety of the industry. And so, their focus is on identifying probable cause and then they'll make safety recommendations aimed at preventing any similar future accidents.
Chris Turnure: Okay. Got it. That's helpful context. And then, can you maybe give us a little bit of color on your dialogue, if any, with the Railroad Commission since the incidence and maybe some color on how that's going, if they intend to look into the incident further?
Mike Haefner: Yes. Yes, absolutely. We've been communicating openly and regularly with them. They're conducting their own investigation, which is standard practice. And the focus there is on whether we complied with regulations in our own procedures. So, we've been in continuing contact with them as well as the City of Dallas and Dallas County. And so far, I mean the regulators have been supportive of the planned outage that we undertook and all of our response efforts to date. And you may have seen in the paper Railroad Commissioner, Ryan Sitton, confirmed in an interview that their view is that we're doing everything that we can and did everything that we could to keep the area safe.
Chris Turnure: Got it. And just one last question on that topic. Do you have a sense as to when the RRC would complete that investigation and make the findings public?
Mike Haefner: No, I don't have a time line on that. And I also want to remind you that the Railroad Commission – we fall under very strict guidelines, both federally and at the state level, and the Railroad Commission has auditors in working with our employees on auditing our practices and our system almost on a daily basis, I think almost every week of the year. So, it's very standard practice. It's not unusual for them to be involved because we all share the same objective, which is safety. So, there's nothing out of the ordinary, unusual here. It's just an extremely unfortunate and tragic event that there was an explosion and a child's death. I mean, just nothing we can say or do that's going to diminish that tragedy.
Chris Turnure: Got it. Thank you, Mike. I appreciate the color.
Mike Haefner: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: I'm comparing Slide 7 to some past Slide 7s, and the percentage of the mix of capital spending has gone up materially since last year, 87% for safety and reliability, 80% last year. Is that just a timing thing as you accelerate – I mean, your planned acceleration of CapEx, which is more focused on the safety and reliability. I mean, I wouldn't think it has anything to do with these incidents because just hasn't been enough time to react to it.
Mike Haefner: No, Charles, good question. It really is timing and where our projects are falling out. For example, over the last 3 years to 4 years, 2 years to 4 years, we've invested very significantly in kind of our storage and compression capabilities, as well as other system fortification projects. So, I think it just varies, but our target is to be 80% or greater in safety and reliability. We also have timing of public works projects, and you've got varying demand in terms of system extension spending for customer growth.
Charles Fishman: So, in terms of your annual CapEx, I think at your Analyst Day, you were talking $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion per year, accelerating over the next – or through 2022. Is that – you're confirming that and reaffirming that, and I mean, you still see yourself in that range. In other words, you're going to be $1.4 billion this year and then accelerating to $1.9 billion over the next 5?
Chris Forsythe: Correct. Yes, $1.4 billion, approximately $1.4 billion this year. $1.4 billion to $1.9 million each year going forward, accelerating gradually, and we put out there the expectation of about approximately $8 billion through 2022.
Charles Fishman: Okay, thank you very much. That’s all I had.
Chris Forsythe: Thanks Charles.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Just as a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website, through August 8, 2018. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Good bye.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-02-07 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Jennifer Hills - IR Mike Haefner - CEO Chris Forsythe - CFO
Analysts: Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Charles Fishman - Morningstar Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Hills, Vice President of Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you. You may begin.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss the future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 20 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $314 million or $2.89 per diluted share compared with $114 million or $1.08 per diluted share reported in the prior year first quarter. Our first quarter results were significantly influenced by the accounting effects of implementing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These impacts affected our first quarter results in two ways. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash benefit of $161.9 million or $1.49 per diluted share. This benefit represents a reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities that were not included in the determination of our cost and service rates due to the new lower federal statutory income tax rate. Additionally, our first quarter effective tax rate, excluding the one-time non-cash benefit decreased to 26.8% compared to 35.9% in the prior year quarter. This reduced income tax expense by approximately $16 million quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our earnings, excluding the impacts of TCJA were primarily driven by the capital spending we are incurring to modernize our distribution and transmission systems and the time to recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms. Operating income in our distribution segment increased 11.5% to $173 million, due to a number of drivers. Recovery from recent regulatory actions provided an incremental $25.6 million in gross profit. Weather was 20% cold than the prior year first quarter, contributing almost $6 million incremental margin due to increased consumption. Additionally, we continue to experience solid customer growth. Over the last 12 months, our distribution segment added a net 32,000 customers, which represents 1% net customer growth. Additionally, we've added several new transportation customers and has seen an increase in demand, most notably in our Kentucky Mid-States division. Combined, this growth added almost $3.5 million of incremental gross profit. Offsetting the growth in gross margin was a 9.7% increase in operating expense as a result of increased pipeline integrity activities and higher depreciation, and property tax expense resulting from our capital investments. Moving to the pipeline and storage segment, operating income increased 25% or approximately $14 million. Most of this increase is driven by the incremental margin from APT's recent rate case and the approval of a GRIP filing in December. The quarter's financial results also benefited from water spreads between the Katy and Waha hubs and the full quarter effect from the North Texas pipeline acquisition acquired late in calendar 2016. Offsetting the growth in gross margin was a modest increase in operating expenses of $1.7 million. Depreciation and other tax expense increased as a result of capital investments but were substantially offset by lower planned amount of pipeline integrity work. Consolidated capital spending in the quarter increased 28.6% year-over-year to $383 million and was in line with our expectations. Over 82% of this spending was focused on improving the safety and reliability of our system. In addition to executing the strategy during the quarter, there were a few other developments I wanted to highlight. In November, we took a couple of steps to further strengthen our financial position. First, we've raised $400 million of equity through a very successful offer, a substantial portion of the 395 million net proceeds was used to reduce short term debt. This issuance has satisfied our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2018. Additionally, we established a new $500 million aftermarket equity issuance program. This program will support our ability to efficiently issue equity beyond fiscal 2018. And as previously mentioned, our results reflected the financial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in late December. The act reduced the federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Additionally, as a rate regulated entity, the accelerated capital expensing provisions and a limitation of interest deductibility included in the act were not applicable to us. Because our fiscal year starting in October 1, 2017, our blended federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be 24.5%. This rate will decline to 21% beginning in fiscal '19. The lower rates reduced our net deferred tax liability by $908 million. Of this amount, 746 million related to items that are included in the calculation of our costs and service rates. This amount was reclassified on our balance sheet into a regulatory liability that we returned to customers through future adjustments to their bills in the course of IRS rules and regulatory requirements. And as previously mentioned, we recognized a $162 million one-time non-cash gain related to items that were not included in the calculation of our cost and service rates. Finally, we anticipate our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 to range from 26% to 28% for any return of excess deferred tax liabilities to our utility customers. We support our regulators' efforts to ensure our utility customers receive the full benefit of changes in our rates due to tax reform. Income taxes, including the determination of our rates, like other costs are passed through to our customers. Therefore, we cannot reduce our rates until we have received regulatory approval from our regulators. We are currently in discussions with all of our regulators to determine the most appropriate manner to reflect the benefits of tax reform and customer bills as quickly as possible. Beginning in the second quarter, our revenues reflect the lower tax rate that would pass through to customers. We anticipate the reduction in operating cash flow from lower customer bills combined with the return of regulatory liabilities establishing connection with implementing tax reform will increase our estimated financing needs through fiscal 2022 by approximately $500 million to $600 million. Our balance sheet as of December 31 is strong and can support this incremental financing need. The equity and total capitalization, at 12/31, it was 57.3% and we had approximately 1.3 billion of revolving capacity available under our credit facilities. I will close my prepared remarks with a few comments on our 2018 earnings guidance. Yesterday, we announced that we raised our 2018 earnings guidance to a previously announced range of $3.75 to $3.95 per diluted share to $3.85 to $4.05 per diluted share. This revived guidance excludes the one-time gain recorded in the first quarter. Our underlying operating assumptions remain the same. We remain on track to spend between 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion in fiscal 2018 with 1.1 billion to 1.1 billion focused on safety and reliability spending. Annual operating income increases from regulatory outcomes in 2018 are still expected to range between $120 million to $140 million before the effective tax reform. Although the revenue requirement for these filings is expected to decrease, the anticipated bottom line impact from these filings remains unchanged. Slide 7 through 12 provide details of the progress we have made during fiscal 2018 in pursuing our regulatory strategy. However, based on some of the growth and economic activity we're seeing combined with the modest increase from a lower effective tax rate, we anticipate stronger earnings in fiscal 2018. As I previously mentioned, the effect of the lower tax rates on our cost and service revenue will ultimately flow through to our customers, utility customers, which reduce revenues beginning in the second quarter. However, we anticipate that we will experience a modest increase in net income as a result of lower effective tax rate on items that impact our pretax income in the current period that are expected to be reflected in rates in the future period. Slide 15 provides additional information to support our fiscal 2018 earnings guidance. Thank you for your time this morning and I'll turn the call over to Mike for his closing remarks.
Mike Haefner: Thank you, Chris for that great update on the quarter. As you can see from our first quarter results, we're off to a great start to fiscal 2018. We benefited from recent regulatory outcomes, colder weather and customer growth. It was also a busy quarter as we rolled out our updated five year plan through 2022 and confirmed the continuation of our strategy to grow by prudently investing in our infrastructure. In November, we communicated our plan to invest 1.3 billion to 1.9 billion each year with approximately 80% of that spending on safety and reliability over the next five years. During the quarter, we continued to successfully execute our investment and regulatory strategy, focused on becoming the safest and most reliable natural gas utility in the country. This strategy along with the exceptional dedication and effort on the part of our 4600 employees continues to benefit our customers in the form of improved reliability and service and we remain very well positioned for the future as we move through the seventh consecutive year of our journey to become the safest natural gas utility. Our systems were put to the test with recent cold snaps, including the coldest day in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex in the past 22 years that occurred on January 16. Our investments and training combined with our infrastructure and process improvements and our employees' tremendous dedication really paid off as we experienced no major disruptions in service during these periods of unusually cold weather. These tests to our system reaffirm that our investments in our infrastructure and our employees are meeting our goals of providing reliable, safe service to our customers. The regulators in our jurisdictions understand that continued investments are needed to modernize our distribution and transmission system. Our regulatory mechanisms have provided the opportunity to make these needed investments by allowing us to minimize lag, recover our costs and provide a competitive return opportunity for investors who entrust us with the capital to invest in the safety and reliability of our system. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed four filings, which should add an estimated $46 million in annualized operating income over fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. A total of 29 million of this amount relates to APT's GRIP filing that covered investments made between October of 2016 and December of 2016. Additionally, in December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a multi-part settlement allowing 8.9 million in new rates as well as changes to our annual filing mechanisms going forward in order to simplify and improve the filings as well as to include up to $5 million in annual rural expansion investment and up to 5 million annually for new industrial projects. The new comprehensive settlement streamlines the regulatory review process and it's a great example of how we collaborate with our regulators to develop win-win outcomes that benefit our customers, the economy in the States we serve and the company. Finally, Chris described the financial effects of the recently enacted tax reform law. The bottom line is that tax reform is very good for our customers. We anticipate that the lower tax rate as a result of tax reform will provide over $100 million annually in savings to customer bill. I want to leave you with a message that our strategy remains the same. We have a long time horizon of needed infrastructure investments. The low natural gas price environment and now lower tax environment supports our continued investment in the safety and reliability of our system, while keeping customers' bills very affordable. We remain confident that we'll continue to be able to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6% to 8% range each year. We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy and now we'll take any questions that you may have. Melissa?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan.
Christopher Turnure: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to clarify first the overall impact on 2018 of tax reform and make sure that I'm understanding your message correctly. It sounds like you're not going to have any incremental financing needs, maybe near term. So that's a neutral, but maybe you get a little bit of a higher rate base and some other kind of impacts that you're inferring for the year that drive it to a net positive for 2018 at least. Is that the right way to think about it?
Mike Haefner: Well, and a couple of things there. They will not need any additional equity financing needs. We're still evaluating our plans and needs for the year in the line of the fact that we're expecting to begin to reflect the lower tax rates in customer bills hopefully this quarter or the second quarter. In terms of longer term, you mentioned the lift in rate base due to the fact that our deferred tax balances will grow a little bit more slowly at the lower rate and that's in fact true and in terms of the other impacts, you captured it pretty well.
Christopher Turnure: And then when we look at guidance being taken up by around $0.10 at the midpoint, is it fair to say maybe there's a bit of positive from tax reform there/some other customer growth impacts that might be a little bit better than you were previously anticipating?
Mike Haefner: Yeah. That's exactly right. It's really a combination of some of the impacts of the tax reform on those items that impact income today that get reflected in customers' bills tomorrow, some of the economic activity that I mentioned, little bit colder weather in late December, January, just really a combination of all the above.
Christopher Turnure: And then just kind of along those lines or more specifically for the first quarter of the year, can you quantify how much gas basis helped you year-over-year and can you quantify weather versus normal.
Mike Haefner: In terms of gas basis, are you talking about spreads in Katy and Waha?
Christopher Turnure: Yes.
Mike Haefner: Yeah. The year-over-year impact on the spread differential was about $1 million to $1.5 million. In terms of the colder weather, it's 20% colder in this quarter versus the prior year quarter, slightly warmer than normal, but we take that $6 million quarter over quarter.
Christopher Turnure: So all of that is after tax numbers?
Mike Haefner: I'm sorry free tax.
Christopher Turnure: That's all free tax. Okay. So 6 million better year-over-year for weather in the first quarter, but roughly in line with normal and then the spreads got you around 1 million, 1.5 million benefit year-over-year?
Mike Haefner: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
Charles Fishman: Chris, I think this is for you. I just want to tie your 10-Q filing with the slides and specifically the tax reform. 908.1 million was your net deferred tax liability decrease. 746.2 million in the Q goes to a regulatory liability that you established, got that. The 161.9 million, the remainder. Okay. Number one, that's reflected in the bottom line of slide 2 and the net income from continuing operations.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. It's kind of a non-recurring one-time gain.
Charles Fishman: Okay. But it's in that line?
Chris Forsythe: Well, it's in the 314 million, we back out the 162 to come back from adjusted net income of 192. If you look at our 10-Q, that 162 is embedded in the $106 million tax benefit that you see in the first quarter.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So in the Q, when it says that 161.9 million benefit is from where it's in your businesses that are not cost of service, is that primarily storage and pipeline?
Chris Forsythe: It really relates to two items. It's related to some tax attributes from our non-regulated companies that we've had in the past that we retained and the fact that goodwill is not included in our cost of service.
Charles Fishman: For that goodwill. Okay. That explains it. Yeah. And then going forward, let me - sort of a follow up here, with pipeline and storage, that's treated similar to your distribution systems, in other words, eventually those rates will be adjusted in the near future to reflect the tax benefit?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah. That's correct. The majority of that segment is APT, which is of course regulated.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And the rail road commission will adjust rates or you will work with the rail road commission to adjust rates for the APT as well?
Chris Forsythe: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.
Spencer Joyce: So, first just kind of a point of clarity. Am I correct in assuming that the year-over-year decline in effective tax rate was substantially compelled by the TCJA? I mean that's right, correct?
Mike Haefner: Yes.
Spencer Joyce: So the quarter had a lower effective tax rate that was seemingly not offset by any margin reductions. Did you all just essentially have kind of one special quarter here where you're retaining that benefit? So I mean we may not see another quarter that's like this per se from kind of a structural standpoint or am I missing something?
Mike Haefner: Well, the effective rate that you see of 26.8% is effectively our estimate of what we're going to be for the full year. So we're expecting that effective rate quarter-over-quarter or each of the next three quarters to be in that 26% to 28% range.
Spencer Joyce: And sort of beginning in fiscal Q2 here though, we'll start to see some rate reductions, potentially cap the margin growth. I'm just wondering how we can have so substantial margin growth I mean 11% plus and then be able to pay that tax rate on that, I mean that can't persist, right?
Mike Haefner: Yeah. Beginning in the second quarter, you'll see our operating revenues come down either through actual reductions in customer bills that get negotiated or approved by regulators, also the establishment of regulatory liabilities getting things back in line.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. So kind of as a longer-term follow-up. Fiscal Q1 here is a bit of an anomaly, even though we had pretty great growth here, I mean, it would be fair to say that kind of your longer term growth expectations, either the explicit kind of stretch guidance, the 6% to 8%. I mean there hasn't been a step function change there, has there?
Mike Haefner: Yeah. No.
Spencer Joyce: A little bit easier, I know, we had the equity deal last year and no new equity expected over the balance of fiscal '18. You mentioned that program, essentially all of that is still available. I mean, there's been very little taken on it, is that correct?
Mike Haefner: That's correct. We took zero in the first quarter because we did complete the block trade in November and so that 500 million is fully available for us after fiscal 2018.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Great. And by the way nice timing on that?
Mike Haefner: Yes.
Spencer Joyce: Final one here, just kind of glancing over the cash flow statement, we still had a fairly nice cash flow benefit from deferred income tax in fiscal Q1, looks like 53 million versus 67 million last year. More fully implementing the TCJA stuff over the balance of the year, can you give us a little guidance on what those figures will look like over the balance of this year? I mean, will they scale down considerably from the 50 plus million that we had in Q1?
Mike Haefner: Yeah. The deferred taxes will scale down. A lot of it would depend on the underlying activity in the business. In terms of total operating cash flow, a lot of that's going to be contingent on the timing of when we actually reflect the newer rates and customer bills. We're working with our regulators as we speak to find the best way to get those into rates as quickly as possible.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Would you like to make any closing remarks?
Jennifer Hills: Yeah. Thank you, Melissa. Just in closing, I want to note that a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through May 2. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Good bye.

===== 2017 Q4  (2017-11-10 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jennifer Hills - VP, IR Christopher Forsythe - SVP & CFO Michael Haefner - President & CEO
Analysts: Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Charles Fishman - Morningstar Mark Levin - Seaport Global Securities
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2017 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Hills, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Hills, you may begin.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss further -- our future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, on forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 26 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we recorded fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations of $3.60 per diluted share, which represents the 15th consecutive year of increased earnings per share. Our performance, as expected, was in the middle of our updated guidance range that we communicated in August. Slides 5 and 6 provide financial highlights for each of our segments. Our 2017 performance was especially satisfying as we're able to achieve earnings per share growth of about 8% despite weather that was 30% warmer than normal and 12% warmer than the prior year. This underscores the importance of our rate design and regulatory mechanisms that serve as the foundation for consistent and predictable revenues and cash flows. Rate outcomes from our 2016 and 2017 regulatory activities provided approximately $97 million of incremental margin year-over-year. In fiscal 2017, we completed 19 filings that resulted in annualized operating income increases of approximately $104 million, which will also benefit fiscal 2018. We also experienced positive economic activity and customer growth, particularly in our distribution segment. Net customer growth approximated 1% or about 28,000 customers, which contributed almost $6 million in incremental margin. And we saw about $6 million of incremental transportation margins through increased automotive manufacturing activity and the addition of several new customers, primarily in our Kentucky/Mid-States service area. Our O&M spending focused in safely maintaining our system in hydro testing, in-line integrity testing and other monitoring activities. Our employees did an excellent job managing all of this work, keeping O&M inflation to just 1.5% year-over-year. Capital spending increased 5% to $1.14 billion, with approximately 80% of our spending focused on improving the safety and reliability of our system. We spent $850 million in our distribution segment, an increase of 15% over fiscal 2016, as we continue to increase the rate at which we're replacing at-risk and vintage pipe. Spending in our pipeline and storage business decreased 17% to $287 million as prior year spending in this segment included the completion of our major APT storage fortification project in the DFW market. Strategically, we completed the sale of our non-regulated natural gas marketing business in fiscal '17 for $147 million. We are now a fully regulated natural gas company. A portion of the proceeds were used to acquire the North Texas pipeline for $85 million. This acquisition contributed $0.01 per diluted share during fiscal '17. However, more importantly, it will help us meet the gas supply needs of the growing DFW market. Finally, we successfully completed $975 million of long-term debt and equity financing. The net proceeds were used to replace $380 million of short-term debt with long-term financing; refinance $250 million of long-term debt that will save our customers over $5 million per year; and the financial capital expenditures program. At September 30, our equity total capitalization was 52.6%, and we had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity available under our credit facilities. All of these developments position us well for a successful fiscal 2018. Yesterday, we announced that fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to range from $3.75 to $3.95 per diluted share. We expect fiscal 2018 to be consistent with fiscal 2017 with the continued successful execution of our investment strategy serving as the primary driver for next year's results. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to range between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. This will allow us to continue our focus on system safety and infrastructure spending, upgrading our natural gas delivery system. And we anticipate receiving annual operating income increases and implemented rate activity of $120 million to $140 million. Next week, we will be hosting our Analyst Day, which will be available through our live webcast. We are looking forward to providing more detailed update during that presentation. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn the call over to Mike for his closing comments.
Michael Haefner: Well, thank you very much, Chris, for that great update, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2017 represented yet another remarkable year for Atmos Energy as we continue to successfully execute our investment and regulatory strategy, focused on becoming the safest and most reliable natural gas utility in the country. This strategy, along with exceptional dedication and effort on the part of our 4,600 employees, is paying huge dividends to our customers in the form of improved reliability and service; paying dividends to our employees in the form of meaningful and challenging work as well as development opportunities; and to our shareholders in the form of delivering consistent financial results, including an increasing dividend. Our shareholders experienced a 15% total return on their investment for the 2017 fiscal year. And since launching our infrastructure investment strategy back in October of 2011, our total return to shareholders was 211% as of September 30, which significantly outpaced the peer group average of 156%. In recognition of our consistent performance, the board declared our 136th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2018 is now $1.94 per diluted share, a 7.8% increase over fiscal 2017. This is our 34th consecutive year of increasing the dividend, and it supports our commitment to providing an attractive return to our investors while continuing to successfully execute our infrastructure investment strategy. We're very well positioned for the future as we move into the seventh year of our journey to become the nation's safest natural gas utility. With the sale of our non-regulated marketing business, Atmos Energy is now a fully regulated, pure-play natural gas distributor, making the company an even more attractive investment with a stronger valuation. We're operating in jurisdictions where regulators understand that investment is needed to modernize our distribution and transmission system. Our regulatory mechanisms have provided the opportunity to make these needed investments by allowing us to minimize lag, recover our costs and provide a competitive return opportunity for investors, which further supports our effort to invest in the safety and reliability of our system. As of September 30, we had 10 regulatory proceedings in progress seeking annualized operating income increases of $59 million. Through yesterday, we have completed two of those proceedings for about $6 million. Most of this increase came from the approval of our annual pipe replacement program in Kentucky. We recognize that growth, along with consistency and predictability, are very important. Next week at our Analyst Day, we will present our updated 5-year plan through fiscal 2022. Our strategy remains the same. We have a very long time horizon of needed infrastructure investments. The low and stable natural gas price environment allows us to continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our system while keeping customers' bills very affordable. These investments will enhance the value of our rate base, which is expected to support continued earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year. Our earnings growth, plus the dividend, should support a projected total return to shareholders of 8% to 10% annually. Now before we go to questions, as most of you know, Susan Giles will retire at the end of November after 15 years of leading our Investor Relations department. Susan was instrumental in developing our strategic messaging as we transitioned from an acquisitive company to one that now grows organically through safety, reliability and other system modernization investments. For 15 years, Susan has been a valued adviser, a relationship builder, a great communicator and a straight shooter. She's been an advocate for the company, and she's earned the respect of the investment community and those of us who have had the wonderful opportunity to work with her day to day. Susan set the bar very high for herself and those around her. But most of all, Susan cared about doing the right things the right way. We will be forever grateful for her contributions, and we wish her the very, very best in her retirement. Now Susan's most recent contribution was helping attract her successor, Jennifer Hills, who's celebrating her inaugural earning's call today. Jennifer brings 18 years of experience on Wall Street, another seven years of experience in accounting and corporate finance roles. Jennifer's experience is a perfect fit to lead our Investor Relations efforts going forward. We're very glad to have Jennifer join our team. And if you haven't already met her, you'll enjoy meeting her next week in New York. Lastly, I cannot close out a successful fiscal 2017 without acknowledging the leadership and contributions of Kim Cocklin, who recently moved to the role of the Executive Chairman after 7 years as CEO and 11 years with the company. Building on our strong foundation, high-quality assets, very capable leaders and healthy culture, Kim recognized the need to invest in our infrastructure, and he guided the restructuring of our rate mechanisms to make those investments feasible. Every single area of the business has improved under Kim's leadership, and every stakeholder, customers, employees, communities and shareholders have benefited from his vision. And our journey to safety is only beginning. I've had the distinct pleasure of working closely with Kim for nearly 10 years. I look forward to continuing to do so as both he and I assume new roles. So we appreciate your time this morning, and now I will turn it back for question. Tim?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan.
Christopher Turnure: I know we're going to have to wait until next week to get the refresh of your long-term plan. But can you remind us, within the current plan as it stands through 2020, what are you modeling for customer growth and refinancings, third-party transport margin, etcetera?
Christopher Forsythe: This is Chris Forsythe. In terms of the current plan through 2020, we didn't assume any material customer growth. It's hard to predict that year in and year out, same thing for transportation margins. In terms of financing, we did have in there a very balanced mix of long-term debt and equity financing. And again, we'll update that through 2022 next week.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. So it sounds like on the customer growth and transport margin side, you guys had a pretty conservative base in there. And then on...
Christopher Forsythe: Yes.
Michael Haefner: Chris, consistent with everything else we have in our plan, I mean, we base it on things that we know and already have in place. So we're conservative about any estimates for upside of growth.
Christopher Turnure: Okay. And then on financing; I think I've been pretty -- consistently gotten the message from you guys regarding the equity that's in that plan. But are there other opportunities to maybe retire debt a little bit early or be a little bit more creative on the debt side of the balance sheet there than kind of what's in the plan right now?
Christopher Forsythe: I think you'll find that the financing strategy is going to be consistent with what we've been doing the last few years.
Christopher Turnure: Okay, fair enough. And then just for modeling purposes, can you give us a share count that is underlying your 2018 guidance? And tell us what the impact for 2017 for weather overall was -- versus normal so we can kind of model out the walk between '17 and '18 on weather.
Christopher Forsythe: Right. On the weather side, remember, we have -- WNA has 97% coverage in our margins. So year-over-year, we were just down about $3 million. If I recall correctly, we lost $86 million margin from weather before WNA. But WNA pretty much brought all that back. So again, the mechanisms are working very, very well. And on the share count, we'll update that for everybody next week.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.
Charles Fishman: Those of us that cover electric utilities are back from the Edison Electric Conference earlier this week, and a topic that occurred in many of those discussions was, of course, the recent movement with the house on tax reform. And those discussions typically talked about the way utility commissions at the state level handled the Reagan tax cuts that landed almost 30 years ago. But obviously, Atmos has a unique situation in Texas with the Railroad Commission. Do you have any input on how the Railroad Commission handled -- I'm assuming the Railroad Commission was regulating natural gas distribution 30 years ago. But do you have any insight about how that happened 30 years ago, similar to what we just heard from utilities about how state commissions handled the Reagan tax cuts for electrics?
Christopher Forsythe: This is Chris. The Railroad Commission was guiding the -- or regulating the industry in Texas 30 years ago. Unfortunately, I do not immediately recall what the Commission did at that time. We can find out very quickly, but it just -- right now, we don't have that at our fingertips.
Charles Fishman: Well, I certainly understand that. Maybe I'll give that to Jennifer as her first assignment of research and get back to her on that.
Jennifer Hills: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Levin of Seaport Global Securities.
Mark Levin: Congratulations to everyone. Obviously, a lot of changes over the last quarter or so, and everybody in new roles. So congratulations to everyone. A quick question when you think about the Atmos going forward. Obviously, the -- certainly, over the last X number of years, you sort of transformed yourselves from being an M&A-centric model to one that was much more organic growth. Is there any reason why that may change over the next three to five years? Is there anything out there that you -- I mean, could you see Atmos becoming more acquisitive? Or will it still be kind of the same sort of trajectory that's been happening over the last several years?
Michael Haefner: Yes, Mark, thanks. This is Mike. No, we do not see any change in our views on M&A, and we don't expect to have that as a portion of any of our plans between now and 2022. I mean, we've -- as you know, valuations are extremely high, and we've got the opportunity today to convert over $1 billion a year in spending into earnings with reasonable certainty. So it's definitely not in our plans given the environmental conditions we're operating in now, but we never say never. Obviously, if something came along, we would look at it but really, we've got this tremendous opportunity. We've got a very long runway of investment opportunities, we've got constructive regulation, we've got regulators that understand the importance of investing in safety and reliability at this time when gas prices are low and stable, it keeps customers' bills very affordable. And we've got a lot of growth in our areas to support. So we don't see that our views on that have changed or will change.
Mark Levin: And alternatively, are there any opportunities -- or would you consider pursuing any divestitures maybe in states where the regulatory jurisdictions aren't as favorable or the growth opportunities aren't as robust?
Michael Haefner: No. We're very comfortable with the assets we have right now and the plans that we have at this point in time.
Operator: There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the VP of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Hills.
Jennifer Hills: Thank you, Tim. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to remind you that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February 6. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-08-05 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations Christopher Forsythe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Kim Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer Michael Haefner - President and Chief Operating Officer
Analysts: Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you. Ms. Giles, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and 10-Q are all available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 26 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Christopher Forsythe: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Our performance for the periods ended June 30 was driven by the ongoing investments we are making to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems. Additionally, we continue to benefit from increased economic activity and customer growth in many of our service areas. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter increased to $71 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $66 million, or $0.64 one year ago. For the current nine-month period, net income from continuing operations reached $347 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, compared with $311 million, or $3.01 from the same period one year ago. Slides 4 and 5 provide financial highlights in each of our segments for the three and nine-month periods. Rate relief generated about $14 million of incremental margin in the third quarter. Substantially, all this increase is recognized in our distribution segment. Since APT had a general rate case in progress, we did not file its customary annual GRIP filing during the second quarter of the fiscal year. That case concluded earlier this week, and Kim will provide additional details during his remarks. Rate relief for the nine months ended June 30 was about $81 million. About 33% or $59 million of the incremental margin was reflected in our distribution segment with the largest increases in our Mid-Tex, Mississippi and Louisiana Divisions. Increased economic activity and customer growth have also favorably impacted our performance. In our distribution business, we continued to experience customer growth and higher consumption, primarily in Texas and Middle Tennessee, resulting in a gross profit increase of about $3 million quarter-over-quarter and about $7.5 million in the current nine-month period. Over the last 12 months, we’ve experienced net customer growth of about 1%, or about 31,000 customers. Additionally, transportation margins have increased $1.5 million quarter-over-quarter and $4.2 million for the nine-month period, with half the increase coming from our Kentucky/Mid-States Division. As we previously discussed, the GM assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee added a third line of production early in our fiscal year. This increased production has had a positive benefits to related automotive components manufacturers in the area and indeed to the large transportation customers. Additionally, a new fertilizer plant in Tennessee came online during the quarter, and two government Energy Consortium in Virginia have switched their boilers from coal fired to natural gas, all of which contributed to the increase. In our Pipeline and Storage segment, APT’s intrastate pipeline benefited from a modest increase in throughput from a North Texas pipeline acquisition that we completed in December, resulting in about a $1 million increase in gross profit for the quarter and $1.7 million for the nine-month period. Additionally, APT has recently experienced wider spreads between the Katy and Waha Hubs, which contributed about $1 million during the quarter. In the prior year quarter, spreads were in the 10% range. During the current year quarter, spreads were in the 35% to 40% range. Rising production from the Permian basin, uncertainties surrounding exports in Mexico from the Waha basin and increased pad on the Gulf Coast in LNG and exports to Mexico have caused spreads to widen in recent months. However, as a reminder, 75% of the incremental margins from this activity are returned to APT’s regulated customers as a revenue credit through APT’s Rider REV mechanism. The period-over-period increases, I just mentioned, reflected this revenue credit. All these margin increases combined with the weather normalization mechanisms, which cover about 97% of total distribution margins more than offset the effects of weather that was 30% warmer than normal from 12% warmer than the same period one year ago. Focusing now on our spending. Consolidated O&M continuing operations decreased about $3 million in the quarter, primarily due to lower legal expenses. For the current nine months, consolidated O&M increased $7 million, reflecting higher employee-related cost, increased line locate activity and hydro testing in our Distribution segment. Additionally, in our Pipeline and Storage segment, we continued to perform significant monitoring, integrity assessments and peaking activities and have incurred additional expense to operate the recently acquired North Texas pipeline and related compressors. Capital spending increased by $22 million to about $812 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. While the 83% of our total CapEx was associated with safety and reliability spending in the first nine months of the year, we expect to begin earning in over 95% of our capital spending within six months of the test year-end. Distribution spending increased about $90 million, as we continued focus on safety – system safety and infrastructure spending. This increase is partially offset by a $67 million decrease in spending in our Pipeline and Storage segment, reflecting the substantial completion in the prior year of an APT project to improve the reliability of gas service to its LDC customers. Additionally, APT elected defer to fiscal 2018 a pipeline repricing project in the DFW market ahead, it’s scheduled to start in the second quarter. The deferral will allow additional time to plan and coordinate the project for the local communities that will be affected. APT has redirected those capital dollars to other activities that will be completed by the end of the fiscal year. We expect our capital spending to range between $1.1 billion and $1.25 billion, inclusive of our pipeline acquisition. At this point, I would like to take a couple minutes to highlight the steps we have taken during fiscal 2017 to strengthen our balance sheet. During the third quarter, we raised about $50 million in equity through our At-the-Market Equity Sales program. All the year, we sold 1.3 shares of common stock under the program for net proceeds of $98.8 million at a weighted average price of $76.32, which was in line with our average trading price of $77 over the same period. Substantially all the shares under the ATM program have now been issued. Additionally, in June, we issued $750 million of senior notes. We offered $500 million of 3% 10-year notes due 2027 and $250 million of 4.125% notes due 2044. This offer reduced the weighted average cost of debt to 5.1%, down from 5.9% at the end of fiscal 2016. This decrease will benefit our customers. The net proceeds will be used to repay the outstanding $250 million 6.35% notes that matured June 2015, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of short-term debt. This activity combined with $125 million of long-term debt we issued during the first quarter, provided $725 million of incremental financing, which we’d use to strengthen our balance sheet. As a result, our equity capitalization ratio at June 30 was 54%, and our liquidity remained strong with about $1.3 billion of capacity available from our credit facilities. This management strength positions us well to sustain our growth for the long-term. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2017. Based on our financial performance to June 30, the substantial completion of our fiscal 2017 regulatory activities; and the increased customer growth, consumption and other positive activity I just mentioned, we now expect fiscal 2017 from continuing operations to be in the middle of the range of $3.55 and $3.63 per diluted share. Slide 20 details the key assumptions supporting our guidance. Further, with the conclusion of the APT rate case and our Mid-Tex annual filings, we have achieved our goal of implementing $90 million to $110 million of annualized operating income increases during fiscal 2017, with about $104 million in annual operating income pre-achieved. Slides 7 through 15 provide details on the progress we have made during fiscal 2017 in pursuing our regulatory strategy. I’ll now turn over the call to Kim Cocklin for his remarks. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We recorded another rock-solid, strong quarter, which sets us up nicely for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Our performance offers another confirmation that our long-term strategy to grow by investing in the safety and reliability of our infrastructure continues to generate consistent operational and financial results. This strategy continues to pay huge benefits to our customers in the form of improved reliability and service to our employees in the form of job security and developmental opportunities and to our shareholders in the form of delivering consistent financial results. In recognition of this consistent performance, the Board declared our 135th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for 2017 is now $1.80 per diluted share. And as Chris mentioned, the execution of our rate strategy continues as the key to our success, and rate outcomes have generated annual operating increases of about $104 million and we have about $16 million on file and pending final action. Most notably, as Chris noted, on August 1, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted a final order in the Atmos Pipeline-Texas rate case. The commission approved an increase to annual operating income of $13 million, effective August 1 of 2017. The significant components of the final order, which were approved include: a rate base value of $1.77 billion compared to $814 million in the last case, which occurred in 2011; an authorized return on equity component of a 11.5%; an overall rate of return of 8.87%; an authorized cap structure of 53% equity and 47% debt; and then the Rider REV mechanism, which was modified to reflect the change in the benchmark from $83.7 million to $69.4 million. You’ll remember that Rider REV is the annual adjustment mechanism that trues up the actual third-party revenue generated by APT against the benchmark, which is now $69.4 million. And any actual amounts above or below that benchmark are allocated 75% to customers and 25% to APT. Later this month, APT will file an annual GRIP filing for the stub period October through December 2016, which will pick up the capital that we invested in the months following the rate case at test year-end of September 30, 2016. We filed the Dallas annual rate filing in January, seeking to adjust rates by $9.7 million for the Dallas area. After discussions with Dallas, we agreed to an adjustment of $7.8 million. The Dallas City Council disapproved that $7.8 million settled amount and reduced the amount unilaterally to $5 million. In addition, the City Council ordered Atmos to show cause that the rates we were charging were just and reasonable. We appealed this Council’s action first taken to reduce the DARR settlement. The issue on appeal is whether our annual rate filing complies with the tariff. We will file a general rate case in response to the show cause order in August with the test year ending March 31, 2017. And we expect both the DARR appeal and the show cause proceeding to result in early fiscal 2018. We also expect a handful of smaller regulatory filings will be made during our last fiscal quarter. But we have successfully achieved our commitment to generate annual operating income increases in the $90 million to $110 million range for fiscal 2017. And as Chris mentioned, more details on these filings are available in the slide deck. You’ve heard this before, we have been and continue to deliver on our promises and commitments. Investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use of our capital, as we strive to become the nation’s safest utility. As the frontrunner and launching this growth through infrastructure investment strategy back in October of 2011, our total return to shareholders was 205% as of June 30, over 70% greater than the peer group average of 120%. We remain resolute in continuing to deliver on our commitments of growing rate base by 9% to 10% and earnings per share by 6% to 8% annually and providing a projected annual total return to shareholders of 9% to 11%. And in November, we will communicate our refreshed five-year plan, which will provide projections through fiscal year 2022. One final note is the management changes that were announced yesterday. Mike will become President and CEO on October 1, 2017, and I will become Executive Chair at that time. This is not sudden and it shouldn’t be unexpected. We’ve been at this transition for three years. Mike has run all the business day to day during this time. We have an exceptional leadership team in the business units and certainly in our shared service groups. Mike will bring and has an edge that is strategic, focused, keen, astute, competitive, motivated and extremely employee centric. I’m going to stay as an active employee and be available to support Mike in any manner that he chooses. On a personal note, I do want to thank all of you who helped me be a better CEO. The analyst and portfolio management community is extremely professional and prepared. I appreciate what you do and how you do it. I’m very proud that Atmos is covered by an exceptionally talented, experienced and dedicated group of analysts, particularly the ones that have a buy on us. Now, Atmos will continue to grow and flourish with Mike and his team, and we are going to continue to be the bell cow in our sector. With that, we are going to take questions. Doug, we’ll turn it over to you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons: Hi, Kim, good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Hi. Good morning, Spencer.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, I’d tell you I was saddened last night to see the news, but I’m honored to be the first here to congratulate you on an amazing run at the helm here, and thank you for what you’ve done for our clients and shareholders.
Kim Cocklin: You’re too kind, Spencer, good to hear.
Spencer Joyce: I’m going to miss our quarterly banter here, but do love you staying on as Executive Chairman to kind of keep tabs on the company here?
Kim Cocklin: I’m glad to hear it from you, and I’m glad you’re still surviving the hockey for AMEX Serve League.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, I’m a little creaky, but so far hanging in there. Congrats on a nice quarter, not a whole lot operationally for me. But actually want to go back to Chris for a second. Chris, you mentioned LNG a little bit and how that had affected the company. Can you just kind of walk back through that? I know that’s kind of a new piece of the commentary there. And just given how much activity is there in your region, I know, it’s been something we’ve kind of been looking toward for a little while. But can you just kind of rehash your comments toward LNG?
Christopher Forsythe: Well, I think, what I was trying to convey was that, the LNG activity along the Gulf Coast is impacting the spreads between Katy and Waha, and as a – as one of the shippers that we have the opportunity to take advantage of those spreads. So it’s the spreads themselves and the increased transportation and through system revenues that we’re generating from that is where the LNG opportunity is going impacting us. It’s not LNG in and of itself, but it’s the spreads and then therefore the resulting through system revenues that we are able to pick up on that.
Michael Haefner: The – in addition to that, there’s lots of increasing petrochemical activity along the Gulf Coast. So that’s also helping to drive the spreads, which of course, feeds into our transportation services we can provide by the pipeline.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. And will that be somewhat volatile kind of year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter, not that it’s hugely impactful to the overall company? But I mean, is it sort of cyclical or volatile, or is it really just kind of a step function change?
Michael Haefner: Well, yes, it’s – the way we look at our pipeline, we’ve got really all of our capacity, excess capacity, subscribed between Waha and Katy in long-term contracts. But we can take advantage of the spreads in our daily business when we have excess capacity. So it’s just another way for us to pick up crumbs along the way. And again, it benefits our rate-paying customers and draws more gas to the system, increases the value of our assets, gives us opportunity to invest additionally and enhancing those assets as well.
Kim Cocklin: And there – Spencer, there’s really no way to anticipate or manage the variability in the geographical spreads that show up. The only time that you can really plan for them is maybe in the summer when certain of the pipelines are taken out of service or maintenance activities and then you’ll see some spreads pop up. But this LNG thing, that shows up kind of unexpected. So not any way to model it. But as Mike said, we are perfectly situated with our pipe and because we connect to Waha, Katy and Carthage, that we can – we could certainly take advantage and will take advantage of this – of the geographical spreads that may show up at any point in time.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Thanks for the color there. And finally, just one other small one. Can you talk a little bit about the assets – the pipeline assets we acquired in North Texas earlier in the year? Have they been, I guess, integrated for lack of a better word pretty smoothly? I mean, are they kind of up to par now that you’ve had them for a quarter or two?
Michael Haefner: Yes absolutely, Spencer. They were, again, perfectly positioned assets for our system. They’ve been operationally integrated completely with the assets in their current state. As Chris mentioned, we’ve had some incremental O&M directed there towards maintenance and integrity work on both their pipeline and our – and the compressor station to kind of upgrade some of the capabilities. But we’ve also got increased margin revenue from those contracts we have on that pipe already. And I just kind of – Dennis Gordon, who runs the pipeline now – Dick Erskine just retired – or is retiring this week. You guys will have a chance to meet Dennis in November, when we come out and refresh the five-year plan. And Dennis will talk about the opportunities and the capital that we have in their five-year plan to further integrate that asset by creating interconnects with our – some of our existing – other existing pipe segments. So it’s just been working exceptionally well and as well as we expected.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Yes, great to hear, and look forward to obviously any updates at that November time.
Michael Haefner: The other point there is that, as Chris may have mentioned, that the GRIP filing we’ll make now, which as Kim said, covers the capital investment from last October through December of 2016, that will also include the $85 million that was spent on that asset purchase.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, perfect. That’s all I had. Thanks, guys.
Michael Haefner: Thanks, Spencer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann: Hi, good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Is it accurate to say that the Railroad Commission’s final order is relatively similar to what the proposal before decision was?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, it’s exactly that.
Brian Russo: And so, would you view this order as constructive and supportive of the 6% to 8% of forecasted EPS CAGR?
Michael Haefner: Yes, we would, absolutely yes. I mean, first of all, we think it’s a very reasonable outcome. Equity at 53% is higher than our last case coming out of 50%. We’ve got the ROE of 11.5%, which is a little under the 11.8%, but with $13 million increase in operating income, you’ve got a $1.77 billion rate base versus $814 million in the last case. And really importantly is that, the final order kind of reaffirmed that this is a pipeline asset and it should be compared to a pipeline peer group. So again, that reaffirms that precedent. And I think further, one commissioner during the commissioners’ conference reaffirmed the importance of certainty in regulation in the State of Texas and to the companies operating in the State in Texas. So from that perspective, it’s a good outcome. It shows the balance, I think, that the commission has to strike between the interests of all parties. And it really supports and enables our continued investment in safety and reliability in the pipeline, further fortification for all the customer growth were experienced in North Texas, and then adding supply diversity. It’s a key component. It’s going to really enable us to continue the growth, EPS growth in the 6% to 8%.
Brian Russo: Got it. Thanks for that. And then so now you just file GRIPs on an annual basis. And then what’s the rules there? How many GRIP filings can you make until you have to file another rate case?
Michael Haefner: I think it’s five years.
Brian Russo: Five years, got it. Okay. And with obviously, the major regulatory item behind you, what should we look for going forward in terms of the more meaningful regulatory filings?
Michael Haefner: I think, GRIP, for the pipeline, we’ll have the GRIP filing later this month. We’ll have a GRIP filing at the beginning of the second quarter of next year to fix up all of our investments in calendar year 2017. And so for the pipeline, it’s – that’s really the focus. It’s getting back into the mode of enhancing the system and modernizing it and making our GRIP filings.
Brian Russo: Okay. And then just lastly, on the revised guidance, it looks like the midpoint was increased by $0.04. And you cited a number of operating performance type of items that enabled you to tighten the range and raise the midpoint. Is this midpoint kind of like the going-forward base to forecast 6% to 8% EPS CAGR?
Christopher Forsythe: Yes, I would say that’s the case.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. Thank you.
Kim Cocklin: Thanks, Brian. We’ll see you next week.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Geoff Healy] [ph] from [Guardian Life] [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, Kim, this is Geoff Healy from Guardian Life. Just not many questions. But I just want to call on behalf of the buy-side fixed-income investors out there and really want to tip my hat to you guys and the tremendous job you did at Atmos, and hopefully looking forward to continuing to support the growth going forward, and best of luck in your future endeavors.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Geoff, very much. Enjoyed it very much, and we appreciate your interest and your continuation to vote with your wallet.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds great. Thanks a lot, Kim.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. I’d like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Doug. Just to let you know, a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through November 8. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - VP IR Kim Cocklin - CEO Chris Forsythe - SVP & CFO Mike Haefner - President & COO
Analysts: Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann Dan Fidell - U.S. Capital Advisors Charles Fishman - Morningstar Research Faisel Khan - Citigroup Mark Levin - Seaport Global
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles. Thank you. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com, and we expect to file our 10-Q by the end of the day. As we review the financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 24 and more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. The successful execution of our growth strategy to invest in our regulated assets continues to drive our performance. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter increased to $162 million or $1.52 per diluted share compared with $143 million or $1.39 1 year ago. For the current 6-month period, net income from continuing operations reached $276 million or $2.61 per diluted share compared with $245 million or $2.38 per diluted share for the same period 1 year ago. Slides 4 and 5 provide financial highlights for each of our segments for the 3- and 6-month periods. Rate relief generated about $40 million of incremental margin in the second quarter and almost $68 million in the current 6-month period. Approximately 70% of the incremental margin was reflected in our distribution segment. Period-over-period decreases, or increases rather were $29 million in the quarter and about $47 million in the current 6 months, with the largest increases in our Mid-Tex, Mississippi and Louisiana Divisions. Margin in the pipeline and storage segment rose almost $11 million in the quarter and over $21 million in the current 6 months from APT's GRIP filing approved in fiscal 2016. We continue to experience customer growth in our distribution business, primarily in Texas and Middle Tennessee, resulting in a $2.5 million gross profit increase quarter-over-quarter and about $4 million in the current 6-month period. Over the last 12 months, we experienced net customer growth of about 0.8% or about 26,000 customers. As everyone is aware, the winter heating season this year was extremely warm. Weather this year's second quarter was 34% warmer than normal and 23% warmer than last year's quarter. The first 6 months of fiscal 2017, weather is 29% warmer than normal and 12% warmer than the same period 1 year ago. However, our weather normalization mechanisms, which cover about 97% of our distribution margins, worked as intended to substantially mitigate the effects of this extremely warm winter. As a result, we only experienced a decrease in gross profit of about $1 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Moving on to our spending. Consolidated O&M for the continuing operations increased by $4 million in the quarter and about $9 million in the current 6 months, mainly due to higher employee-related costs, incremental pipeline maintenance activity and increased line locate activity, which is an indicator of the growth we're experiencing. For example, in the first 6 months of the first fiscal year, we had 515,000 line locator requests in our Mid-Tex Division alone. This equates to a 4% increase compared to the same period last year. The incremental pipeline maintenance spending reflect increased levels of monitoring, integrity assessments, continuing activities being conducted at APT, combined with incremental spending related to the recently acquired North Texas pipeline and related compressors. As a reminder, we acquired this asset during the first quarter for $85 million to provide additional capacity to serve our growing North Texas customer demand. It also provides increased access to the Barnett Shale, Oklahoma and Northeast gas supply bases. Capital spending increased by $23 million to about 559 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2017. Distribution spending increased about 90 million as we continue to focus on system safety and new infrastructure spending. Pipeline and storage spending decreased about 67 million, reflecting the substantial completion in the prior year of an APT project to improve the reliably of gas service to its LDC customers. Approximately 77% of our year-to-date CapEx was associated with safety and reliability spending. And we begin to earn -- expect to earn on over 95% of our capital spending within 6 months of the test year end. Our capital spending is still expected to range from 1.1 billion to 1.25 billion for fiscal '17, inclusive of the pipeline purchase. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal '17, Our financial performance for the first 6 months of the fiscal year came in line with what we expected to be and our fiscal 2017 earnings guidance and assumptions remain unchanged. We still expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations to range between $3.45 and $3.65 per diluted share. Slide 18 details the key assumptions supporting our earnings guidance. We expect the continued execution of our regulatory strategy to be the primary driver for this year's results. We remain on track to begin implementing between $90 million and $110 million in annualized operating income increases during fiscal 2017. Slides 7 through 14 provide details about the progress we have made during fiscal '17 in pursuing our regulatory strategy. I will now turn over the call to Kim Cocklin for closing remarks. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Chris. Excellent, excellent report. And it's in the time to enter our favorite week here, this is derby week. And we've recorded another solid quarter, very, very steady results, no surprises, and we're extremely encouraged with the positive outlook for the remainder of our fiscal 2017. Progress with our rates and regulatory work continues. We enjoy very positive relationships with our customers and the regulators in the states that we serve, which is critically important. And with our investments in our regulated assets of over $1 billion annually through 2020, we continue to demonstrate our absolute commitment to safety and reliability. And regulators and customers very much understand how important these investments are to make our system as safe as possible as we continue our journey of becoming the nation's safest utility. Rate relief continues as the primary driver of our financial results. And as of May 3, rate outcomes have provided annual operating increases of about $30 million thus far in this fiscal 2017 year. And you can see that on Slide 17. We do currently have request pending which are requesting adjustments of about $132 million, with the lion's share of that amount coming from our Mid-Tex Division rate review mechanism, which seeks an adjustment of some $43 million as well as the pending APT rate case seeking an adjustment of $55 million. And as we've discussed, the APT case was filed proposing no changes to any existing policy or precedent, particularly as it relates to cap structure and return on equity. Our team did an excellent job of presenting our case to the hearing examiners about two weeks ago, and we're expecting that initial decision by June 6 and then the statutory deadline for decision in the case by the Railroad Commission is July 10. So we'll know something by then. Looking forward with our upcoming rate activity, we do expect to submit other 5 to 7 rate filings by our fiscal year-end that, in total, would request another $15 million to $20 million of additional adjustments to our operating income. And with the sale of our non-regulated gas marketing business now fully complete, Atmos Energy is now a fully regulated pure-play natural gas utility, making the company an even more attractive investment with a stronger valuation. We continue to honor the commitments that we've made to all of our constituents, with expected earnings per share growth of between 6% to 8% annually, and providing a solid dividend we're offering our shareholders a total return proposition of between 9% and 11% on an annual basis. We very much thank you for your time this morning, and now we'll open the call up for questions. Adam?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce from Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Spencer Joyce: I guess, first things first, congrats on another beat here, nice quarter. One question for me. I know we talked about it a little bit last quarter, but the midstream assets you picked up from EnLink several months ago, are those performing kind of in line? And are they driving any discernible impact to the consolidated results? I know it was really a gross margin beat for me kind of across the board here.
Kim Cocklin: You wouldn't take your eyes on those midstream. I mean, it's a classic add-on to our intrastate pipeline, very integral part of the intrastate. So it's just another high diameter, or high-pressure, large-diameter pipe that's bringing additional supply from very important areas to our system that is experiencing some wild growth up on the north end.
Spencer Joyce: Yes. So of the 16% or so or I guess it's about $17 million or so of margin growth in the quarter, how much would be attributable to that kind of, or layering in that piece in the system?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. There really isn't a material increase in margins as a result of the EnLink acquisition for the quarter or year-to-date period.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. So all that growth there is on a core GRIP driven?
Chris Forsythe: Core GRIP, GRIP and other rate regulated activity that we're doing from last year.
Kim Cocklin: Organic good old-fashioned growth, Spencer.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, hey, that's the highest quality there.
Kim Cocklin: From new business.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, one last question. Kim, I heard you reference a 9% to 11% range at the end of the call. That is rate base growth through...
Kim Cocklin: No, no, that's the total shareholder return.
Spencer Joyce: Oh, okay, okay.
Kim Cocklin: The 6% to 8% earnings per share growth and then the dividend on top of that. You have not updated your note here recently. You used to write about that.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. I got you. I wanted to make sure I didn't miss a 9% to 11% EPS growth or something there. That caught my...
Kim Cocklin: But you're right about the rate base growth, it's doing about 10% to 11% with our investment of about 125 million through '20.
Michael Haefner: Yes, we came out of -- this is Mike. We came out of '16 at about a rate base of $6 billion, and we expect to end this year somewhere $6.5 billion to $6.9 billion. And 2020, $8.5 billion to $9 billion so.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Brian J. Russo: Just on the APT rate case. The RRC staff testimony is out. There's quite a bit of intervenor testimony filed as well. Obviously, ROA is -- ROE is a debatable item. But on equity ratio, the intervenors -- the staff agreed with your equity ratio filing. The other intervenors suggested to add short-term debt to the cap structure when calculating your equity ratio. And I'm just wondering, is there any precedent for the RRC to include short-term debt in past rate cases for you or your peers?
Michael Haefner: No, Brian. This is Mike. It's -- I mean, excluding short-term debt has been preestablished precedent and it's the standard.
Brian Russo: Got it. Okay. And are all the intervenors kind of influentially equal? Or do some carry more weight than others?
Michael Haefner: I mean, I would say, that's for the hearing examiners to decide, but really, we just want to take you back to the point that we communicated all along. And that's, our case and our filing was very, very straightforward based on previously established policy and precedent. We weren't asking for anything new and really, the environment and the way we operate the pipeline business hasn't changed since the last case. So we're very comfortable with our case and our team did an excellent job presenting that case during the hearings.
Brian Russo: And in the last APT rate case outcome, was the ROE established based on a pure-play midstream peer group? Or was it established on a blended regulated gas LDC and midstream peer group?
Michael Haefner: I think the method that was really established or set as a result of the last case, the framework created by the Railroad Commission was to use a pipeline peer group and that's what we did. And our experts referred to a pipeline peer group to establish the ROE that we recommended in the case.
Brian Russo: Got it. Okay. And can you just broadly speak about your weather normalized mechanisms in your larger jurisdictions that offset the mild weather?
Chris Forsythe: Sure. This is Chris. Again, we have WNA coverage in 97% of our margins. Colorado is the only one who doesn't have WNA. Most of the mechanisms utilize a 30-year normal NOAA. That's the period where to calculate the adjustments under the various mechanisms. In Texas, it's a 10-year derivation that's based upon a 30-year normal. So our coverage period generally cover November to April. We have a couple of that go even further. And then Virginia, although it's the smallest territory, that is an annualized, a full year worth of WNA coverage.
Brian Russo: Okay. So I'm just curious, is it almost, I understand kind of the GAAP earnings concept of that, but is it almost real-time cash recovery as well?
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Yes, we adjust our bills in the month, every month based upon the heating degree days and the mechanisms that are built in the billing systems.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fidell from U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.
Daniel Fidell: I'm sorry, what was that? I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any additional APT expansion opportunities you see at sort of, specifically, in relation to gas takeaway capacity in the Permian. I think in the past, I think I've seen some comments about basically adding compression at Waha being an opportunity. So just in a broad sense, if you could talk about APT and expansion there.
Michael Haefner: Yes. We have, right now, we have a 36-inch pipe coming out of Waha to the Metroplex area. And we're, our team's in discussions with producers out there. We have a little bit of ability to add some capacity there as well as the opportunity to move some more gas by adding compression. But all that's being discussed right now. And again, I mean, from our perspective, the sole benefit of that is to our LDC and other tariff customers. It's really providing more access to additional supply. And also, helping those customers by creating markets for the producers.
Daniel Fidell: Okay. Would you sort of characterize it as sort of opportunistic, taking a look or something we might sort of consider more of a substantive approach?
Michael Haefner: It would be opportunistic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.
Charles Fishman: Kim and Chris, I'm looking at the transcript from last quarter, and this question was asked before about tax reform. Let me ask it again to both of you. Your response last time, just to refresh your memory, was, what you'd heard so far was neutral to good. Is there anything you've heard since you answered that question that would change that response? Or move it one, move the boundaries one way or the other?
Kim Cocklin: No. Given the limited information that's been provided, it's still, we still handicap it as neutral to good for us.
Charles Fishman: Okay. That was the only question I had. Okay. Great. And I realize that there's a lot of moving pieces still, so that's certainly an appropriate answer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisel Khan: Just a couple of questions to clarify your comments on the capacity between Waha and the destination that's east. So are you saying that right now, you've got no excess capacity right now to move volumes east from Waha into Carthage and Katy? Or is that full you're saying? And so you're exploring what you can expand after 36-inch pipe? Or do you have excess capacity right now? And could you move more volume as production ramps up in the Permian?
Michael Haefner: We -- Faisel, this is Mike. We have a small amount of capacity right now, maybe 100 million a day. And that's really where we are in terms of our ability to move additional gas west to east.
Kim Cocklin: You might talk about what we'd have to do to add it.
Michael Haefner: Yes, I mean, to add it, we'd add compression. And I think we add compression along our system that would allow us to bring more gas into the Metroplex and then deliveries down into Katy.
Faisel Khan: How much more? What's the potential expansion opportunity?
Michael Haefner: I think we're looking at maybe 200 to 300.
Faisel Khan: Okay. And is the way that it works, if you add compression then that would -- would that -- once you establish your -- once you get to the rate case here in APT and you add these volumes, would that lower the overall system rate for all the customers on APT or would it be additive to the margin?
Michael Haefner: Yes. Through the Rider REV mechanism, there's a credit back to the tariff ratepayers. And then there's a sharing mechanism, where above it there's an established benchmark and then above that benchmark, 3/4, 75% of that would be returned to customers through adjustments in rate. And below that benchmark, if we fall below the benchmark, 75% of that would be credited or increased in rate.
Faisel Khan: Okay. Got it. And that makes sense.
Michael Haefner: So clearly, the primary driver is for the benefit of the rate paying customer.
Faisel Khan: Sure. That totally makes sense.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Levin from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Mark Levin: Two quick questions. Kim, this one's for you. Is there any scenario in which you can envision from the Texas Railroad Commission that would impede your ability to hit guidance this year?
Kim Cocklin: No.
Mark Levin: Or next?
Kim Cocklin: No.
Mark Levin: Got it. That's my first question. Second question is with regard to M&A. And I'm speaking more generally, not about Atmos specifically, but in terms of industry M&A. Do you expect or do you think that the tax reform uncertainty at this point will likely cause or create a temporary or a pause or a delay in the rather voluminous amount of M&A we've been having over the last year or so?
Kim Cocklin: Yes.
Mark Levin: Perfect.
Kim Cocklin: You have a question now? Okay.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
Susan Giles: Just to remind you, a recording of the call is available through August 2 on our website, and we hope to see many of you at the AGA Financial Forum in a couple of weeks. We appreciate your interest and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

We do appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We are off to another very, very good start. We continue to refine and sharpen our business model of delivering safe and reliable natural gas to the over the 3.1 million customers we serve in eight states and after divesting the non-regulated marketing business effective January 01, we're now the largest pure play natural gas only distributor traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the reorganization of our portfolio of asset is now complete. As a 100% fully regulated utility, we will take full advantage of this opportunity to intensify our focus on our strategy and vision of becoming the safest natural gas utility. Progress with our rates and regulatory framework continues to provide rate relief, which is the primary driver of our financial performance. We continue to emphasize and build relationships with our regulators and communicate the importance of our infrastructure investments to ensure the safety and reliability of our system. And as of yesterday, rate outcomes have provided annual operating increases of about $20 million and we filed cases that are pending, which seek about $78 million of increases. The more significant filings include the APT general rate case, the intrastate pipeline, which we've talked to everyone about for about the last three years, filed with the Texas Railroad Commission in early January and we are seeking to recover a deficiency of about $55 million. As again we had emphasize that there are no surprises in this filing, the test period for the case ended on September 30, 2016. The proposed rates are designed with a 13.5% return on equity and a 59% equity component and a rate base value of roughly $1.77 billion. The filing as you recall, is required by the GRIP Statute and will provide a comprehensive review of our existing rates as well as a review of all capital investments made under the GRIP Statute. The procedural schedule is expected to be final this week and a final order is required by law to be issued on or before July 10 of this year. Other filings that are currently pending include the rate stabilization clause in Louisiana's trans-law jurisdiction seeking a deficiency of about $4 million, the annual review mechanism in Tennessee seeking $2 million, the rate review mechanism for the West Texas cities of about $5 million and the Dallas annual rate review for the City of Dallas requesting $10 million and these are all part of the annual mechanisms that we have in place in those jurisdictions. We do expect to make between 12 to 15 more filings this fiscal year, which will request between $70 million and $80 million of additional operating increases and most of this is shown on Slide 18 provides the summary of those expected remaining 17 filings. Again, we've begun our sixth consecutive year of executing our strategy to grow by investing in our regulated assets. We're projecting to invest between $1.1 billion and $1.25 billion of capital this year and $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion every year through fiscal '20 and the successful execution of this strategy is critical to making our system more safe and reliable growing our rate base and achieving our commitment to provide an increase to earnings per share of 6% to 8% annually, which translates into our earnings per share guidance of 410 440 in fiscal of 2020. Again, it's very important to emphasize and recognize that we're now able to have a singular focus because our portfolio of assets are fully regulated and we'll continue to build upon the trust and straighten the important relationships we have with our customers, regulators and legislatures in the states and communities we serve. Finally, our results are coming for our existing operations with no reliance on stock buybacks or one-time adjustments. We voted with our pocketbook again for our shareholders and our Board raised the indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '17 to a $1.80, a 7.1% increase over last year. Yesterday the 133rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share was declared and we will continue our commitment to deliver total shareholder return in the 9% to 11% range through fiscal '20. Now I am very pleased to introduce you our new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Chris Forsythe. Chris joined our company in 2003, coming to us from Price Waterhouse Cooper. He served as Vice President and Controller since 2009, giving him exposure and leadership responsibility in all areas of finance and accounting for the company. He most recently led the team responsible for the sale of the nonregulated assets. Chris has the trust and confidence of our Board. He will be a great asset to the Senior Management Team and will be a tremendous Chief Financial Officer. Chris, welcome.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Kim. I appreciate your kind remarks and I look forward to serving my new role and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest at Atmos Energy. I look forward to the opportunity to meet all of you in the coming months. As Kim mentioned, we exited the nonregulated gas marketing business effective January 1. Historically, this business represented up to one third of our former nonregulated segment. The sell-off of the opportunity for us to realign our reporting segments. Beginning this quarter, we report our operations under the following three segments; the distribution segment, which is primarily comprised of natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states and two storage assets located in Kentucky and Tennessee. These storage assets are used for operation in these states and will fall in reported in our nonregulated segment. The pipeline of the storage segment is comprised primarily of the regulated pipeline storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana, which are also formally reported in our nonregulated segment. And finally, the natural gas marketing segment, which is comprised of the natural gas marketing business we sold in January. We've reported these operations as discontinued operations. My remarks this morning will focus on income from continuing operations. Net income from computing operations was $114 million or $1.08 per diluted share compared with $102 million and $0.99 one year ago. Slide 3 and 4 provide financial highlights each for continuing segments for the three-month periods. Positive rate outcomes remain the primary driver of our success. Rate increases for our distribution and pipeline storage segments combined, generated almost $27 million in incremental margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. About $16 million of the related -- of the rate filings completed in fiscal '16 came from the distribution business. The largest driver of the increase came from our Mid-Tex division, which saw a gross profit rise of nearly $7 million quarter-over-quarter. We also experienced a $4.5 million increase in our Louisiana division and a $2 million in our West Texas division. The remaining $11 million came from our pipeline and storage segment, primarily a result of the new rates and APT's GRIP filings improved in fiscal '16. Distribution transportation revenues rose quarter-over-quarter by about $2 million largely from industrial expansions and increased demand for natural gas. As an example, in Tennessee, the General Motor's plant in Spring Hill has expanded and recently added a third shift. We transport the natural gas used within the plant and to support the manufacturing process. The increase in production has a positive trickledown effect to the automotive component manufacturers in the area, many of whom are our transportation customers. Additionally, several of our distillery customers in Kentucky are expanding and natural gases used in processing the mash, sterilizing the bottles and cleaning facilities. Finally, in the Kansas City area, we supply the natural gas used to fuel UPS' Waste Management CNG fleet. Both CNG facilities came online in 2016. Our distribution business also continues to add customers, resulting in $2 million increase in gross profit compared to the prior year quarter. Over the last 12 months, we experienced a net customer growth of about 0.8% or about 24,000 customers. On the spending side, O&M continuing operations increased about $5 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to incremental pipeline maintenance spending. During the quarter, we elected to accelerate higher testing and other pipeline charity work in the first quarter ahead than originally planned for later in the fiscal year because the crews were available following the completion of similar work at the end of 2016. Capital spending increased by $7 million to about $298 million in the first quarter compared to one year ago. This increase was in line with expectations as we continue to focus on safety and consistent reliability in infrastructure programs. Approximately, 78% of our CapEx was associated with safety and reliability and we expect to begin earning on over 95% of our capital spending within six months of the test year end. In addition, in December we acquired a 140 mile 24-inch pipeline for $85 million to provide additional capacity to serve our growing North Texas market. It also drives increased access in the Barnette Shale, Oklahoma and the Northeast gas supply basins. As Kim mentioned, we remain on track to achieve our capital budgeted target of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion for fiscal '17 inclusive of this pipeline purchase. Moving now to our earnings guidance, our guidance and assumptions remain unchanged. We still expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations to range and $3.45 and $3.65 per diluted share. Slide '16 details our earnings and selected expensive projected for 2017. The continued execution of our rate strategy is still expected to be the primary driver for this year's results with annual increases in incremental rate activity in 2017 ranging between $90 million and $110 million. Slide 6 through 11, provide details of the progress we've made during fiscal 2017 and pursuing a regulatory strategy. Thank you for your time this morning and we'll now open up the call for questions. Jessie?
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Chris Turner with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Turner: Good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Turner: I wanted to get some more color on short-term debt when you guys think of terming any of that out a little ways down the road, are there any hedges in place right now in terms of forwards that you are thinking about or awarded on?
Chris Forsythe: Our short-term debt was about $941 million at the end of the quarter. We did receive proceeds up on the sale at AEM of about $135 million, which was basically used to pay down that debt. As early this week, our short-term debt balance was about $750 million. As you're aware, we do have a $250 million debt financing that matures in June of '17. We do have hedges in place for that at about 3.367% and if that debt matures and we do have cash flows in place, we do anticipate refinancing at that time.
Chris Turner: Okay. But that one particular issuance that you know is coming hedge but nothing else?
Chris Forsythe: The 2019s are also hedged. We're focusing on the near-term and we have those in place at roughly 3.5% as well.
Chris Turner: Got you. Okay. And then on the pipeline business, could you kind of remind me of the sharing mechanism with customers there and exactly how that works and kind of where you've been the past couple years if over at all.
Kim Cocklin: Yes Chris, the rate feature was market-based revenue as credited back to the LBC primarily LDC customers, the benchmark was set in the last case 2011 at $84 million. And in our annual filings we've been coming in under that. As you know there is 75-25 share. So, we pick up 25%. We're insulated from that perspective. Customers would pick up 75% of any shortfall and vice versa if we run over customers benefit and 75% of any of the over. So, we've been coming in under. If you look at the filing, the filing request an adjustment to that benchmark of just around $70 million. Based on what we're seeing in terms of the changing marketplace. lower basis spreads and also declining volumes out of the Barnette shale.
Chris Turner: Okay. So, you've been running under and you've been absorbing 25% of that difference between $84 million and where you're actually at right now for the past year or couple of years.
Kim Cocklin: Correct, correct. That's why Chris, we're adjusting it from $84 million to $70 million as we've been running on. The mechanism we're proposing not to change this year and allocation either.
Chris Turner: And in terms of an overall sharing mechanism for over earning from the rest of the assets, my understanding is there is a sharing mechanism in place there, is that correct.
Kim Cocklin: Over earning, we don't over earn. You talked about…
Chris Turner: If you were to, would you have to give it back to customers?
Chris Forsythe: Are you talking about the mechanism just for that revenue? There is actually an earnings band associated with the GRIP mechanism and if we were to exceed that 75 basis points currently above the 936 allowed rate of return, if we were to exceed that, we would be called in for a case. We had to go in for a case. That's where that earnings band and the annual earnings monitor report is filed, but we have not come close to that. So, that's unrelated, but there is not a sharing mechanism there. It's just a earnings governor on the GRIP mechanism. But as Kim said on the revenue sharing related to prior, the recommended adjustment -- recommending adjustment of our benchmark is $70 million, but keeping the structure of the mechanism with the sharing 75-25 the same as it is today.
Chris Turner: Okay. So, for the pipeline business overall, there is a ban around the authorized ROE and if you go above that ban, which you've not been doing so far, you could be called in for a case?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, the earnings monitor report is filed annually and that's available. It's a public record and that reflects the return, the overall return that was achieved by the pipeline in that 12-month period and to the extent that we exceed our overall rate of return, which is the 11.8 per equity at current 50.5 design and then weighted average cost of debt, which gives us a 9.36 overall return, which includes a 75 basis point band around that but we've never ever exceeded that cap.
Chris Turner: Okay. Perfect. That's what I wanted to understand. Thanks guys.
Kim Cocklin: Sure. Thank you, Chris.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Levin with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Levin: Hey guys. Another good quarter.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Mark.
Mark Levin: Yes. Good morning to you Kim. Couple of quick questions and your low end, high end of the range, the $3.45 and $3.65 low end, high end of the range on CapEx, anything in particular that would happen over the course of this year, that would take you to either one end or the other?
Kim Cocklin: Well, it's very early and we are very confident that we went ahead and restated and reconfirmed the guidance at that level. So, we are obviously again -- first quarter start, we thought we had an excellent quarter. Everything is performing as expected. We might have spend a little bit on O&M, but we expect that to come back in line. So, everything is lining up right now to provide us to meet the commitments that we've made to the state in the earnings range and then to generate the 6% to 8% earnings per share that we've talked about continuing to invest in the right base to do that.
Mark Levin: And then from a political perspective, potential tax rate changes and impact on you guys and Kim, is there anything else politically that you see with the new administration that could either have a positive or negative impact looking forward.
Kim Cocklin: We're in Texas, we're succeeding from the union, that's the plan. We're in that mercy, we're very thankful that we're regulated by very balanced states. All the tax information, we obviously have our subject matter experts in house, including Chris and our Vice President of Tax and then the folks in the rates and planning area. They're all studying the proposals, but who knows where they'll end up. We're staying on top of it and the information that's being provided from some other folks, we're just not in a position to provide any kind of anticipated outcome given the total uncertainty surrounding what happens in Washington. We'll wait, you might pick up -- if you're on Saturday Night Live, I think there's some better information of what's coming out daily, but it's just -- we're managing our business for the long-term and as I said before, we thrived during an Obama Administration. We thrived during the Bush Administration. We thrived during the Clinton Administration. We're going to be able to thrive and manage and that's our responsibility and accountability. So, we'll adjust if necessary, but everything that's coming out right now and most of the proposals look to be extremely manageable from our standpoint the way that we're currently capitalized and the way that we currently continue to execute our strategy.
Mark Levin: Got it. And then on the Texas pipeline case, any scenario you can envision that would have a negative or adverse impact to your long-term earnings guidance?
Kim Cocklin: We're drilling that top water beta out here today aren’t you?
Mark Levin: Big picture, I am letting you run with it, but no, is there anything, any type of situation or anything there that would cause you some concern for the long-term guidance or do you feel like there's -- that you're even under a worst case scenario, you're okay.
Kim Cocklin: Yeah, I think that we are positioned like in the pipeline team again we started 3.5 ago there is absolutely no surprises to the folks that are in that case. It would do us no good. So, we want to maintain a relationship and the credibility and trust that we build with the customers and with the regulators and so there is nothing in that case other than the fact that we haven't been in for 6.5 years. So, we do have a significant deficiency, which reflects the current rate design which builds upon a 13.5 return upon a much different capital structure, which includes a 59% equity layer versus the current, the existing rates of 50.5 and then you've got a significant increase in O&M because of the need to comply with all the new regulations. The existing rates are designed on $80 million of O&M and we're spending close to $130 million right now. So, those things will be talked about and we want to be the safest natural gas utility. Our customers want safe and reliable service and we're going to work with them and meet them in the middle.
Mark Levin: Makes perfect sense. Last question then I'll leave for someone else. Any -- as you think about your pipeline of spending or your pipeline related spending over the next several years, are you seeing or do you anticipate any bottlenecks whether it be labor materials anything that would cause you to have to slow the pace or does everything look fine as you look out over the next several years?
Chris Forsythe: Yeah Mark, everything looks fine. We don't see any bottlenecks. Our relationships with regulators, we've got very strong long-term relationship with contractors. We've got just a top-notch engineering team. We got projects lined up already identified for the next five years. We got 30 years cost of spending. On pipe replacement, we got tremendous growth, North of Metroplex. We don't see any -- we don't have any concerns about materials, excess materials, labor or anything else for that matter.
Mark Levin: Great. Appreciate it. Congrats on a great start to the year.
Chris Forsythe: Thanks Mark.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Forsythe: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Could you just elaborate a little bit on the APT general rate case process, no procedures schedule is set and there is discovery and request for information. Is there a window of time for settlement discussions?
Chris Forsythe: Yes, as Kim I think said in his earlier comments, we expect to have a procedural schedule this week with the statutory deadline of July 10. We're in discovery now, I would say maybe a third way through that process and then there will be testimony, hearings, several opportunities for settlement conferences. Those conversations occur consistently throughout the process. So, we expect the proposal for decision typically would be in mid-May timeframe and you got opportunities for corrections, but it's a very measured process and there is opportunity for settlement all along the way.
Brian Russo: Okay. And then Kim, you're filing directly with the RRC, you're not in negotiations with the cities or anything?
Chris Forsythe: No, you've got -- you're correct. We filed directly with the railroad commission, the intervenors, same lawyers that represent the cities in our distribution cases and so we got great relationships with them. We work with them every year on those annual filings. So, there is really nothing new. As Kim said, we file based on preference. We've been preparing this for three years or longer. We've had open communications all along about what's driving our investment. As he said, we've seen significant increases O&M. It's driven by new compliance requirements and we've been open and transparent about it all along. And so far, the dialogue has been very good and positive. It doesn’t mean we all have significant disagreement from where it should end up, but it's proceeding as we would expect.
Brian Russo: Okay. Great. And can you remind me was the last APT rate case settled or it was litigated?
Kim Cocklin: It was litigated. It was the outcome of a litigated -- certain of the issues were resolved and settled prior to the litigation, but I think the return was definitely litigated in that case and may be depreciation and normally you'll find it -- they'll pick in shoes. There's a lot of the cost that are included that we're requesting that are agreed-upon as part of the cost of service and then the rate base again has been reviewed as part of the GRIP proceedings and the filings that we've made. So, they'll be continued oversight of that and a little bit about a look back, but in the last case, I think we had a very small amount of the GRIP that we adjusted may be $1 million. It's a pretty prescriptive process and it lends itself to the opportunity of all the parties to conduct of very good and full review, but at the same time, to have as Mike said, plenty of opportunity for discussion, but it does have to be fairly -- they're prescriptive in terms of the discovery dates and the answers to those discovery requests and then the filing of the testimony and the hearing on the issues that are going to be heard, the initial decision and then the briefings and comments on that initial decision and then leading to the statutory deadline of July 10 of this year. But again, you're right to ask all the questions and we are in as good a position as we can. We can't emphasize the fact that we started looking and preparing for this about three 3, 3.5 years ago and this is certainly not our first rodeo here in Texas.
Brian Russo: Understood. Thank you.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce: Good morning, Kim. Good morning, Chris. Nice to have you on the call.
Kim Cocklin: You're running out of companies to cover.
Spencer Joyce: No kidding, but I appreciate you keeping at least one for me out there.
Kim Cocklin: It will be two water companies and two utilities I guess.
Spencer Joyce: Yes absolutely. Hopefully a couple of pretty quick ones for me, the recently acquired pipeline assets in North Texas, how long until those are I guess wrapped into APT a rate making or a regulatory standpoint, are they perhaps included in this most recent five-year GRC?
Mike Haefner: Spencer, this is Mike, they're not included in the rate case that we just filed, but the transaction closed on December 20, which puts it in the three months period that we will include in a GRIP filing once we come immediately, once we come out of this case. So, in the fourth quarter.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Got you.
Kim Cocklin: That GRIP filing that Mike's talking about covers the period of investment -- capital investment from October 1 to 12-31-16. We have the test period ending September 30. So, all of the rates in the case that are being composed, include all of the cost and investment up until September 30 and once we get out of the case, then we will file what everybody calls a stub filing for that three month of investment and that $85 million will be included in that filing.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. So, it seems pretty easy from a regulatory standpoint to just wrap those assets into your regulatory workflow if you will, just write off the bat.
Kim Cocklin: Absolutely, which makes it, it's very unique because of that there is very little lag. It's immediately accretive given the transportation contracts we have that we acquired with the pipeline and that piece of that pipeline provides significant benefits to our customers. It was mentioned earlier, it's 140 miles. It runs West to East, North of the DFW Metroplex. We have one interconnected with our system today. We expect to add three others. It will be integrated in a very short order and all of our growth -- a lot of our growth is North of the Metroplex. So, it provides immediate fortification, give us additional access to additional supply in Barnette shale as well as eventually we'll be able to bring in Oklahoma and Northeast Gas and so our customers will benefit tremendously and we're able to purchase that fraction of the cost that will take to build something like that. So, it's truly a win-win.
Chris Forsythe: And it's easy Spencer because of the excellent management and the strategic focus that replaced on the relationships and creating the necessary mechanisms to provide this opportunity. You wouldn't find the capability of doing this in a lot of jurisdictions or in a lot of company. Again it's six years, it's over of work where we've emphasized an efficient and effective process for ratemaking and everybody's involved, everybody understands, there is a clear line of sight from what we're doing in the field to what eventually ends up creating more safety and more reliability and an enduring to the benefit of the shareholders long-term. So, it is easy only because of what is -- what the people at Atmos Energy have been able to do throughout the entire organization.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, duly noted there and I know…
Chris Forsythe: Yes okay.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, you've done a great job working towards being able to effectively navigate the regulatory process there in Texas. Switching gears a little bit, Chris this might be one for you, the $135 cash inflow from the AEM sale, it's mostly working capital right?
Chris Forsythe: That's correct. The purchase price was $38.3 million of working capital and we estimated just prior to the end of the calendar quarter, was about $103 million. We will be truing up that working capital here in the second quarter and hope to have that completed by the end of March. In addition to that, $7 million in total proceeds from the transaction or roughly $141.5 million using the estimated working capital of $103.2. $7 million went into escrow under the terms and conditions of the purchase and sale agreement, assuming no indemnification issues that we would have to reimburse us for 0.4 we would expect to get $3 million back in January of 2018. The remaining $4 million in January of 2019.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Very helpful there. Last one real quick, am I right that there were a few assets that were previously held in the non-reg segment that have now migrated into the pipeline and storage and Chris, I apologize, I think you might have hit this.
Chris Forsythe: Yes, I touched on it briefly. The primary asset is our 21 mile intrastate pipeline in Louisiana. We refer to it as Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline or TLGP. We had that -- that pipeline was built in 1985 to help supply our Louisiana gas distribution operations at that time. So, that is the primary asset that moved from the nonregulated segment. We also have a couple of other smaller assets that aren’t material that did roll up in the segment as well, but that was the primary piece.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. Perfect. Just a point of clarity on mine there, but in any case Kim as always, congrats on a nice quarter and we'll be talking soon.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you. Thank you, Spencer. Look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. Kim, first of all I am in total agreement with you. You're spending a lot of time speculating on what might come out Washington DC is a exercise in futility. However, my job as an analyst is obviously to try to think about those kind of things, but specific to Atmos and tell me if my thinking is right. Since your debt is at the Op Co level, really you're in pretty good shape, but you would just wait until there is changes to your returns that reflect any kind of changes in the tax increases and you should be pretty neutral regardless of what comes out of DC. Am I thinking about that correctly?
Kim Cocklin: Under the current all -- all the current propaganda that's coming out, we would be neutral to good.
Charles Fishman: Okay. And then let me maybe as a follow-up, your payout ratio is still 50%, 55% I believe.
Chris Forsythe: It's right around 51% yes.
Charles Fishman: But your target is 50%, 55%.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. We're growing the dividend at a rate equivalent to the earnings per share rate of 6% to 8%.
Charles Fishman:
?:
Kim Cocklin: Absolutely. That's a very important lever that we have available to us because we have one of the -- it may be the lowest payout ratio in the peer group. So consequently, our highest and best use right now based on the current laws that are in place and the tax statement is to pour the dollars back into the ground and improve our safety and reliability. But for sure, if there is motivation and incentives, then you're rewarded and we need to reward our shareholders in that manner, we certainly would.
Charles Fishman: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you for that help.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from the line of Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Ted Durbin: Hey, guys. How are you? 
Kim Cocklin: Ted, what happened, it thought you were in the MLP space.
Ted Durbin: I'm still here guys. I haven't forgotten about you.
Kim Cocklin: Welcome back. Good to hear your voice.
Ted Durbin: Good to hear you. Let's question usually obviously on the pipeline rate case, so I guess maybe just starting with the ROE, you are asking for a 13.5 year, you authorized to 11.8 year. You are in the Mid-Tex between 10 and 10.5 range, I guess how do you square that as relative to other sort of numbers?
Kim Cocklin: For the 118 it was set back in the 11 and there is a much different economic climate out there. There is currently different administration out there. I mean there's a whole lot of discussion and debate about what the tax treatment should be. The fed has indicated that they are definitely going to on make a move this year once now we hear twice maybe three times, so you are looking at 75 basis point potential move maybe even more depending on what the economy does.  So, I mean given the risk profile of the intrastate pipeline and the fact that the peer group is the FERC and you cover those folks. So, I mean that's what they're going to look at and we are not being overzealous in requesting a 13.5%. We think that reflects the level of our return that we need to compete and attract capital in the marketplace going forward.
Ted Durbin: Okay. And a similar question I guess you're asking for 60% equity layer, you are authorized to 50% before you are running at 50% of the corporate level I guess what's is the gist of that risk…
Kim Cocklin: It will be. There is better that the actualcapstructure for the parent because we're not the hold-co. It is what it is and 60% equity ratio and taxes is recognized as it's not out of the ordinary. And again it's not considered excessive. And we don't anticipate much of an argument on the 59.7 that we've reflected in the case. And in taxes short-term debt is excluded from calculation which is why this is coming at 59.
Ted Durbin: Got it. And then on the GRIP itself is the presumption is that that will continue here even though you're in for the general rate cases or anything that would change that mechanism at all coming out of this case.
Kim Cocklin: No, no. That's a statute, that's legislation. So, the regulators really can't touch that, that has to be adjusted over, it would be modified only by the legislature and that legislation was enacted in 2003.
Ted Durbin: And so, then the ROE established in this case just to make clear that's where they are going to the GRIP filing on a forward basis as well?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, that's right.
Ted Durbin: Okay. That's great. And then last one the rate case at least what do you have baked into, so you got the long-term guidance 410 to 440 in 2020 what have you baked in terms of ROE and equity layer on the taxes, interest about?
Kim Cocklin: Nice try, nice try. We're not getting there yet, we've not taken it, come on. We'll remind you that when we established the 410 to 440 for the 2020 fiscal period, it was prior to the time that we filed this case, I think it was year and half ago or so that we established. So, we baked in assumptions and again we're not -- we don't put out those commitments lightly, those are things that trust and confidence by you all we know that you take into the bank and put them in your model. So, we've got. Those are very important and we understand the significance and importance of making those representations.
Ted Durbin: Understood. And then if I could get two more on still on the pipeline system lot of talk now on the risk that there may not be enough gas take away out of the West Texas, out of the Permian with all the activity out there. Is there any more room to squeeze any more volumes on the western end of the system?
Kim Cocklin: We have some capacity available yes and there has been a lot of interest in conversations with producers. 
Ted Durbin: Anyway, to quantify that is I don't know 100 million cubic feet per day or less or more?
Kim Cocklin: I mean it's in the 200 million a day I think we have to trade this one down. 
Ted Durbin: Got it.
Kim Cocklin: In West Texas.
Ted Durbin: In West Texas, so just be adding compression or you wouldn’t consider loop in the line or anything like that?
Kim Cocklin: We haven't included at this point to find out the opportunity for incremental capital investment, but that is something that where the team is looking at as well as at this point in time. Obviously, anything that we would do there is really in to the benefit of our LDC customers. I mean we are in a good location out there and we have expanded in the past, so we have the capability with our right away that we have in place to potentially look at the flow studies that would incorporate some additional looping of lines to increase capacity or we could add compression. And that's all certainly you know a daily task that we look at and if the need arises and the opportunity that arises we are in positions to take full advantage of it. 
Chris Forsythe: We did that a number of years ago, I mean where the economics makes sense and we got a long-term in our contracts is certainly something that we will do.
Ted Durbin: Got it. And then similar question the last one for me, is a lot of activity north of you on the scope and stack in Oklahoma some questions around gas take away there, how much room is there on the northern end of the system to take an incremental gas?
Kim Cocklin: Really that acquisition of North Texas pipeline for [Manley] gives us an awful lot of opportunity as east end of that 140-mile pipeline, we got interconnects with three interstate lines. We don't have the capability right now, but in the future we would have the capability to bring gas into the system from Oklahoma as well as from the Northeast. So, lot of opportunity there in the future.
Ted Durbin: Anyway to quantify how much more you could bring in you think?
Kim Cocklin: Not at this time.
Ted Durbin: Okay. All right. I'll leave at that. I appreciate all the answers.
Kim Cocklin: Thanks, Ted. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joe Zu with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Zu: Good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Joe Zu, how are you doing?
Joe Zu: I'm good. Congratulations and Chris congratulations.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you very much, Joe Zu.
Joe Zu: Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick on tax side, do you take any repair tax deduction?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, we do.
Joe Zu: Can you quantify that?
Kim Cocklin: It's roughly 30%, 45% of our capital expenditures on an annual basis.
Joe Zu: And do you expect any tax reform will remove that deduction?
Chris Forsythe: As you look at the side-by-side comparisons of house plan -- Trump plan, I mean there is house plan the 100% expensing on the Trump plan, there is the potential for optionality. So, if one of those plans move forward in their current versions, yes, that would impact the repairs deduction. But as Kim said there is a lot of noise out there right now we're just kind of evaluating all the options. And we are really not in a position at this point to definitely say one way one way or the other how tax reform is going to impact us.
Joe Zu: Right and if all things considered, it should be neutral too good for you guys right.
Chris Forsythe: Yes. Based on current proposals and what we're seeing, definitely neutral to good Joe. Again, the people, we're not going to put out any kind of prognostication on what could happen based on what's up there now because there's so much that can change that would be I think reckless and imprudent to say okay, if this happens then there's this much accretion or that happens then there's this impact. I think that send you down some rabbit trails that are pretty unnecessary at this point.
Joe Zu: Right. Understood. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good quarter.
Chris Forsythe: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I would like to pass the floor back over to Susan Giles for any additional or concluding comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Jessie and I just want to remind you all that a recording of the call is available on our website through May 3. We appreciate you joining us. Have a great day.

===== 2016 Q4  (2016-11-10 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Bret Eckert - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Kim Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer Mike Haefner - President and Chief Operating Officer
Analysts: Brian Russo - Ladenberg Thalmann Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2016 Year End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations for Atmos Energy. Thank you. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Donna, Good morning, everyone. And thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 29 and more fully described in our SEC filings. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during our discussion. Slides 2, 3 provide information regarding these financial measures. Our first speaker is Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Susan, Good morning, everyone. We do appreciate you joining us, as well as you continued interest in Atmos Energy. My remarks will primarily focus on the financial results for the full fiscal year. Slide three and four summarize our net income and earnings per share. Yesterday, we reported earnings of $3.38 per diluted share for fiscal 2016, representing the 14th consecutive year of increased earnings per share. Earnings excluding unrealized margins were $349 million or $3.37 per diluted share in 2016, compared with $316 million or $3.10 per share last year. Results for 2016 include a 5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, income tax benefit as a result of adopting new accounting guidance for stock based compensation. As expected our regulated operations drove all of our earnings growth during 2016. Rate increases lifted regulated margins $87 million during 2016 with almost 80% coming from our Texas utilities and our regulated pipeline APT. Slide eight to 17 provide more detail on the results of our rate filings in 2016. These increases more than offset the negative effect of weather that was 25% warmer than the prior year. In the distribution segment we experienced a 17% decrease in sales volumes due to weather. However, with our weather normalization mechanisms covering about 97% of utility margin the impact to gross profit was only about $3.4 million. And APT experienced a 4% year-over-year decrease in consolidated throughput and lower storage and blending fees which negatively impacted gross profit by about $4 million. Additionally, we saw our average distribution customer count increased about seven to tenth to 1%, primarily in our Louisiana, North Texas and Tennessee service areas, which contributed $6.6 million in incremental gross margin. O&M spending increased year-over-year, driven by a $26 million increase in the regulated business and we anticipated higher levels of pipeline maintenance spending related to safety. Finally, capital spending in our regulated segment increased by about $124 million for the year, prim due to higher plans spending in each segment. Over 80% of our capital expenditures were associated with safety and reliability spending and we will earning at over 95% of CapEx within six months of test year end. Slide seven gives some detail around the spending in 2106. ‘ Our non-regulated segments performance for 2016 was inline with expectation. As announced last week we entered into a definitive n agreement to sell all of the equity interest in Atmos Energy Marketing LLC to CenterPoint Energy Services. This transaction will include the transfer of approximately 800 delivered gas customers and AEMs related optimization business at an all cash price of $40 million, plus working capital at the date of closing. Assuming receipt of customer approvals we expect the transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2017. These assets contribute about a third of the non-regulated 2016 earnings, down from the prior year, primarily due to the effects of warmer weather and lower realized margins from asset optimization activity. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 these results will be look forward as discontinued operations. The remaining contribution from the non-regulated segment for 2016 was primarily from our storage and transportation assets. These generate demand fees and other revenues subject to regulatory oversight from a regulated operations in Louisiana and Kentucky. These assets will be retained because of the support they provide to regulated operations. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2017. Slide 23 details our earnings and selected expenses projected to 2017. We have announced that 2019 earnings from continuing operations are expected to range from between $3.45 and $3.65 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations is expected to range from $365 million to $390 million. We expect the continued successful execution of rate strategy to be the primary driver of next years result. We anticipate receiving annual increases from implemented rate activity in 2017 of $90 million to $110 million. Slide 25 provides a rate filing outlook for the upcoming year. We have assumed normal weather and weighted average gas cost purchases to be in the range of $4 to $6 per Mcf. O&M expenses is expected – is projected to range between $535 million and $560 million for the year with a continued emphasis on pipeline maintenance spend. Depreciation expense is higher as you would expect, as a result of our higher capital spending. Capital expenditures for 2017 expected to range between $1.1 billion and $1.25 billion. This will allow us to continue our focus on system safety and infrastructure pending and upgrading of natural gas delivery system. With respect to our financing plans, we currently anticipate incremental long-term financing of $1.5 billion to $2 billion to fiscal 2020, funded through the long-term debt and continued equity issuances through aftermarket equity program, the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings. Further details can be found on slide 27. Most important these financing plans have been contemplated and are included in our guidance range for 2017, as well as our guidance that we've established to fiscal 2020. Its important to note, that the sale of Atmos Energy marketing will no impact our ability to continue to grow earnings per share 6% to 8% annually through 2020, nor would impact our ability to meet our earnings per share guidance of 410 to 440 in 2020. Thank you for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Kim for his closing remarks. Kim, ready to?
Kim Cocklin: Very much, Bret. As you heard fiscal '16 for Atmos was remarkable year on many counts and the financial performance followed, as a result of the very strong performance, our Board of Directors authorized a 7.1% increase for our quarterly dividend. The fiscal '17 indicated dividend rate is now $1.80, an increase of $0.12 per share. This is our 33rd consecutive year of increasing the dividend and supports our commitment, provide an attractive return to our investor while continue to successfully execute our infrastructure investment strategy. Our shareholders experienced a 31% total shareholder return on their investment for the fiscal '15 year, compared to peer group average of about 24%. Our liquidity financial position and balance sheet remained exceptionally strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 48.5% at September 30, 2016. Last month we increased our credit facility from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion and retained the $250 million according feature. This facility was extended to September 25, 2021 with all other terms remaining substantially the same. During fiscal '16 we launched the aftermarket equity offering and issued 1.4 million shares for $98.6 million in net proceeds. Also during the year, Standard & Poor's upgraded our corporate credit rating from A with stable outlook. I'd like to comment on the sale of our non-regulated gas delivery business. Texas-based CenterPoint Energy is an excellent fit for this business and for the phenomenal employees that are engaged in it. CnterPoint provides the scale and capabilities that will enable growth in this business. Our decision was driven by our long-term vision of becoming the safest natural gas utilities. This vision directs all of our investment of time, energy and capital to our regulated businesses with much of that investment focused on replacing and modernizing our utility and pipeline assets. The proceeds in this transaction will be redeployed to fund infrastructure investment in the regulated business. Most importantly, upon completion of the transaction Atmos Energy will become a fully regulated pure play natural gas utility. Our growth continues to be driven by our focus and well executed rates and regulatory strategy. For fiscal '17 we anticipate receiving annual increases from implemented rate activity in the $90 million to $110 million range. Our CapEx spending budget of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion in fiscal '17 will enhance the value of a rate base, which is expected to support our earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%. We remain committed to delivering dependable, long-term financial success. Our earnings growth, plus the dividend will support our projected total return to shareholders of 9% to 11%. We recognized the growth, along with consistency and predictability are important as we move into fiscal '17. Thank you very much for your time and attention and interest this morning. We're ready to take any questions that have. Donna?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Brian Russo of Ladenberg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi, good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Just want to get your thoughts on your forecasted EPS CAGR of 6% to 8%, as noted in the slide presentation, '16 CAGR over '15 was 8.9%. And it seems that over the last several years you have consistently reached the high end of the range or the range or exceeded that range, and I just want to get your thoughts…
Kim Cocklin: Your observation Brian, very astute.
Brian Russo: I mean, so I would imagine there seems to be a bias towards the higher end of the range, given past performance?
Kim Cocklin: Past performance is no guarantee of future performance or whatever that SEC disclaimer is.
Brian Russo: Understood. Can you remind us what the base year is or does it just kind of roll forward each year when you update the CAGR?
Kim Cocklin: So our base year – our base year related to that plan was our '16 through '20 plan. And so we're building that off, you know it came out with the five year plan when we launched it last year. So…
Brian Russo: Okay. So we should use the $3.37 of '16 as a base year for the five year plan?
Kim Cocklin: Maybe base it off the 305 that we actually launched off of in '15, so when you put this '16 to '20 plan out, I'd say put guidance down, we launched it off the weather adjusted 305 for 2015.
Brian Russo: Okay. Got it. And the sale of the marketing business, if I recall correctly, I've been assuming about a $27 million EBITDA run rate. The sale price is $40 million plus working capital. Could you disclose for us what the working capital is to try to get a better feel for what the multiple was that the sale was at – the sale was at?
Kim Cocklin: Well, you're starting with the wrong EBITDA number.
Brian Russo: Okay.
Kim Cocklin: We retained some of the assets about two thirds of revenues that were generated are retained by us with assets that are traditionally characterized as regulated operations. And they were - those are intrastate pipeline and storage facilities that we owned and that were relied upon by the marketing group to serve certain of the customers behind our city gate customers. And those are customer that not being transferred with the sale. So about one third of the operations are gone….
Brian Russo: Okay. So one third of $27 million of estimated EBTIDA?
Kim Cocklin: Correct.
Brian Russo: Okay. Got it. Understood.
Kim Cocklin: And working capital is just a wash.
Brian Russo: Okay.
Kim Cocklin: We are not paying anything to working capital. They are just reimbursing us for what the working capital amount is.
Brian Russo: Okay. Understood. And then could you just talk a little bit about the new pending gas infrastructure compliance regulations that I think are going to be implemented maybe next year?
Kim Cocklin: Are you talking about Trump plan or what you talking about?
Brian Russo: No, I was just hearing from other companies that there is incremental gas infrastructure compliance being contemplated by the regulatory agency?
Kim Cocklin: I guess that stems us…
Mike Haefner: Yes, Brian this Mike Haefner. That’s still working its way through, expected earliest implementation date will be 2018. And as we've said before, we always welcome fair balance, safety regulations because it really drives incremental investment in our system.
Brian Russo: Okay. Great. And then just on slide…
Mike Haefner: Hold on, I think its important to recognize that we're not relying on the promulgation or issuance of any new regulations to support our capital budget going forward. The 1.1 to 1.25 is essentially the amount that we need to spend in order to – get to the point that we want to get to with the current regulatory structure in place. So nothing we have in our guidance for this year through 2020 is based on a hope or prayer or something that you know might or might not occur in '17 and it also bakes in to the equation you know the sale of marketing and what has been so, what's and retained.
Brian Russo: Understood. And then just on slide 25, as always, you've got an active regulatory calendar and I'm just wondering are there any one or two of these filings that we should be more focused on as the gross margin driver that you have outlined of rate recovery in 2017?
Bret Eckert: Yes, I mean, Brian. This is Bret, I mean if you look at slide 25 and you go back to slide 8, and slide 8 details the key regulatory outcome that we got in '16. But you know the majority of the – over 80% of our investment is in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. And so those rate outcomes continue to drive earnings. The RMM in Texas that we've got in mid Tex in 2016, those rates won't affect June 1, so that’s the timing each year those rate impacts go in. And in Louisiana it varies between the trans-log mechanism going in the 1st of April and LDS going in the 1 of July. So you look at Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, those are the largest pieces of what the drives our rate.
Mike Haefner: I mean, the real the only case you got to concern yourself with is APT, that’s the rate filing that we're going to make probably on January 7th, all this other stuff is formulaic, I mean, its pretty much settlements that we make on an annual basis, the RRMs and stuff and those will be reported. But filing of the APT case is really the one that you know want to watch and its really not going to have effect in '17 or not very little effect in '17.  So you'll have plenty of opportunity to react to anything that comes out that case, that maybe unanticipated but we're not expecting anything, we're filing as we talked about with you and everybody else we're filing that case down the middle of the fairway we're not proposing any unique or new features or relying on any policy program, regulations that are not in place already. So that’s the one and it will filed in January and you along with everybody else will get ample information surrounding that case.
Brian Russo: Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, the capital markets activity that you guys laid out in your presentation. Is that consistent with the prior disclosure?
Bret Eckert: Yes.
Brian Russo: Excellent. Thank you.
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Spencer Joyce of Hilliard Lyons Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice year. And it looks like your Cowboys have started to imitate ATO? But just a couple of quick ones for me. First one, housekeeping one for you, Bret. I believe you said this, but the marketing will be discontinued ops when we see Q1 results, correct?
Bret Eckert: Correct
Spencer Joyce: Okay. And that means that the guidance ranges, particularly O&M, are all the ex the AEM?
Bret Eckert: That’s correct, they are all from continued operations.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, perfect. Then just a second one. A little more broadly, we are several years now from the major sales and footprints shifts that we saw related to Illinois and Missouri, et cetera, et cetera. Kim, can you just talk about several years down the road here or how you feel about the current footprint of the to be100% regulated company?
Bret Eckert: We're excited about it, we've been focusing for the last five years and really that – the marketing company and the assets that we sold to deliver gas business that we sold is an excellent business and its an excellent hit for CenterPoiint, energy, great group of employees, you've been in their offices you know they do a wonderful job and it brings I think a new market to CenterPoint that they are going benefit and they are going to grow that business. I mean, for the last five years now when you constrained the business because of the appetite that we had or the little appetite we had risk and we continue to try to mitigate as much risk as possible and emphasize for as much money as we could into the regulated side of business. So been said, you know we're going to be the largest pure play, a hundred percent regulated natural gas utility that’s traded on the exchange and we think that you know we bring a very compelling opportunity to a - lot of a lot of funds and we're very excited about the remaining portfolio and we're very comfortable with what, we have that it’s a great possibility, we're little bit ahead of the curve and – little bit of hedge start on the Trump infrastructure, the administration that’s going to be or emphasizing infrastructure, we think that's going to be great, for a country, great for our business for sure and we're going to continue to try lead the way there. So you know people have been asking about the non-regulated company and a lot of one-on-one just comprised a lot, us conversation and it really has been a very, very minor part of our portfolio less than 5%. So you know it will – we'll able to talk all about our regulated operations and the opportunity that they present and we think that we're in a extremely balanced regulatory jurisdictions right now we have really, really good customer base. We continue to work on trust and credibility with the customers, with the regulators, with the politicians and with those folks that represent the customers as well. So we're excited about future.
Spencer Joyce: Absolutely. Fantastic color there. I know you mentioned the Marketing had taken up a large portion of the conversation. I know just from a publishing and a modeling standpoint, it will be nice to be able to set that to the side, even though definitely some good guys and gals over there? 
Bret Eckert: Outstanding people.
Spencer Joyce: All right. Again, great year and we will talk soon.
Bret Eckert: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time there are no additional questions in queue.
Susan Giles: Great. Thank you, Donna. And just to remind are a recording of this call is available for replay on the website through February the 6. Again, we appreciate your interest in Atmos and thank you for joining us. Good-bye.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Susan Giles, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Giles, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release, conference call slide deck, and the Form 10-Q are all available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such differences are outlined on Slide 22 and more fully described in our SEC filings. Additionally, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Slides 2, 3 and 17 provide information regarding these financial measures. Our first speaker is Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We had a strong quarter from both a financial and operational perspective, which has positioned us well to achieve our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.35 per diluted share. Slides 2 and 3 summarize our net income and diluted earnings per share. As you can see, diluted earnings per share, excluding mark-to-market gains, increased to $0.67 during the quarter and to $2.98 for the current nine months. Positive rate outcomes in our regulated businesses continue to drive our growth for the three-month and nine-month period, and offset the negative of weather that was 25% warmer than last year's winter heating season. Rate relief for our regulated distribution of pipeline operations combined generated about $18 million of incremental margin in the quarter and about $66 million for the current nine months. Additionally, over the last 12 months, we experienced customer growth, primarily in our Colorado, Louisiana, North Texas and Tennessee service areas. Our average customer count has increased to about 0.75% or 1% during this period, which contributed incremental margin of about $1.5 million for the three months and $4.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. As I mentioned, weather was 25% warmer than the prior nine-month period, and negatively impacted each segment of our business. In the distribution segment, sales volumes decreased 19% period-over-period. However, our weather normalization mechanisms, which cover about 97% of utility margins, worked as designed to limit the negative impact of lower consumption due to the warmer weather and gross profits at just $3.6 million. Year-to-date, our regulated intrastate pipeline experienced a period-over-period decrease in through-system volume and lower storage and blending fees due to the warmer weather, which negatively impacted gross profit by about $4 million. And year-to-date in our non-regulated segment, we experienced larger settlement losses and net long financial position, primarily in our second quarter, as prices fell due to the lower demand driven by warmer weather. However, we saw this trend reverse in the third quarter, as this segment realized gains on net short position. Focusing now on our spending, consolidated O&M rose about $5 million in the quarter and $11 million in the current nine months, primarily due to increased pipeline maintenance spending related to safety, and the timing of spending period-over-period. Capital spending increased by about $129 million in the first nine months compared to one year ago, primarily due to planned increases of spending in both of our regulated segments. About two-thirds of this increase was incurred in our regulated pipeline segment, but we continue to enhance and fortify our Bethel and Tri-City storage facilities, and to improve our ability to reliably deliver gas to the Mid-Tex division and APT's other [LBC] customers. We now expect fiscal 2016 CapEx to be at the top end of our previously announced range, approximating $1.1 billion. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 earnings per diluted share to range between $3.25 and $3.35, excluding net unrealized margins at September 30, as shown on Slide 17. The expected contribution from our operating segments, as well as estimates for selected expenses for the year, are also highlighted on Slide 17. Planned O&M spending lagged during the third quarter, as a result of wet weather experienced in our Texas jurisdiction. However, we expect to catch up with our planned maintenance work in the fourth quarter, and to put us back on track to our forecasted O&M range of $550 million to $565 million for the full fiscal year. I would like to finish with an update on our aftermarket equity program, which was introduced last November as an integral part of our financial plans through 2020. We issued about 1.4 million shares under the program during the current quarter and received $98.7 million in net proceeds. The proceeds will help fund our robust capital spending needs. Thank you for your time and now, I will hand the call back to our CEO, Kim Cocklin, for closing remarks. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very, very much, Bret, excellent report, and good morning to everybody. As you've heard, we recorded another strong quarter, and we remain on very solid footing as we approach the end of our fiscal 2016 year. The successful execution of our rate strategy during the fiscal year has generated an increased operating income of about $119 million. And during the fourth quarter, we expect some very limited regulatory activity with filings which remain pending, or that we expect to file, but we do - we have successfully achieved our commitment to generate annual operating income increases in the $100 million to $125 million range for fiscal 2016. And during the quarter, S&P did cite the time we recover our invested capital is the primary reason to upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to an A from A minus with a stable outlook. And with our annual investment of $1 billion to $1.4 billion through fiscal 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to safety and reliability. So we remain very steadfast to deliver the execution of our financial and operating plans, and our results do validate our commitment of growing earnings per share by 6% to 8% and providing a total return in the 9% to 11% range. We've had a great quarter. We thank you for your time and we will open it up for questions now, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the Joe Zu of Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Zu: Hey, good morning. How are you?
Kim Cocklin: Joe Zu, very good. How are you doing?
Joe Zu: I'm doing great. Thank you, Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Great. Good to hear from you.
Joe Zu: Good to hear from you, too. Just a big picture for you, Kim. With the Oncor deal being done, how do you look at the [indiscernible] acquisition landscape, especially in my favorite state of Texas?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, the overall landscape for acquisitions or - the acquisition of…
Bret Eckert: The overall landscape.
Kim Cocklin: Well, I think - we have been talking about Oncor and NextEra and the activity in Texas for some time, and it wasn't a surprise to most people that NextEra had moved in after the [hunt] proposal got hung up in the regulatory arena on the restructure proposal that they had. So I think that NextEra is going to be pretty successful in their attempts to bring that to a successful close. I think the activity seems to have slowed down somewhat. There are fewer and fewer companies to choose from. I still think that the electrics are looking to add gas platforms to their strategy, and it seems to be something that has been well received by the market. If you look at the performance of those that have picked up gas utilities and where they were trading, what they paid, and now where their stock price is, so it's anybody's guess. Money is cheap. We'll have to see as we talk, Joe - many times what happens with this election year and who successfully comes out as the President and who is running the legislature, as well But I hate upon on the question but I don't know - I don't have a specific answer on what kind of activity is going to continue in that space, or in our space.
Joe Zu: Great. Well, thank you very much, Kim, and congratulations on the quarter.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Joe Zu. It is good to hear from you. We look forward to seeing you.
Joe Zu: Same here. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: I realize adjusting the CapEx to the high end is really only a $100 million increase, but maybe if you could just elaborate on what is driving that?
Mike Haefner: To you want me to take that one question?
Kim Cocklin: Yes.
Mike Haefner: Brian, this is Mike. How are you doing today?
Brian Russo: Good, thanks.
Mike Haefner: Good. Yes, the big driver falls in a couple of categories. We have new infrastructure mechanism in Colorado, so we are spending some money there to start replacing that higher-risk infrastructure. The other big driver is really our growth in Texas and Louisiana, and also public improvement projects. Lastly, I would say we've got a start on some projects, and we're getting a start on some projects, this year that we need to complete in the first quarter of next year, so that is really what is driving the incremental or the – coming in at the top end of that range.
Brian Russo: Got it. And the $1 billion to $1.4 billion forecasted annually for the next several years, do you think there is a bias towards the high end of that or it is too early to tell?
Mike Haefner: I think we will continue to support the $1 billion to $1.4 billion, continuing to drive it at 9% to 10% rate base growth.
Brian Russo: Okay. Great. And lastly, you guys always got a lot of open regulatory dockets, et cetera, and you've outlined many in the presentation. Maybe you could just comment on one or two that are more meaningful contributors to the annual margin, or any of these settled cases or pending cases that are just noteworthy?
Mike Haefner: Well, you know, of the $119 million implemented year-to-date that are in the book that we put out there, so much of that now is driven by annual mechanisms or infrastructure mechanisms that don't require a full case. We've got the Kentucky PRP filing that went earlier this month on file. Those rates should go into effect in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. And then, we will have a couple of more filings coming in Mississippi with the stable growth [rider] and the stable rate filing, both of those will go before the end of this fiscal year, and expected outcomes in the first quarter of next fiscal year. So we remain on track. As Kim said, we anticipated $100 million to $125 million, we came in and implemented at the higher end of that range, and the level of investment that we are talking about and the continued increase in capital spending we anticipate will continue to support that level of increases.
Kim Cocklin: What remains pending really, Brian, is some very limited filings that are those that we do expect to file as well, and if you look at the information that was provided for this presentation, there's a pretty good summary of what is out there and what remains. But the big-ticket items have been already settled and in the books, and so we are really focusing on fiscal 2017 filings right now and beyond.
Brian Russo: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of MorningStar. Please proceed with your question, Mr. Fishman.
Charles Fishman: Just a quick question. When you referred to growth as one of the reasons bumping this year's CapEx, that is customer growth, I assume?
Kim Cocklin: Yes.
Charles Fishman: Okay, and is that Dallas driving that or…
Kim Cocklin: We have had growth in Dallas, in the mountain towns of Colorado near – in our Olathe area in Kansas, as well as in Tennessee, south of Nashville, and even in Louisiana. We are looking at an estimate of about 12% year-over-year growth in new customers. We have had, trailing 12 months, about 23,000 new customers added across the system at a growth of about 0.75%.
Charles Fishman: 12%, that is fantastic.
Kim Cocklin: That is new growth not net, it's not net, it is new customers, and that is a year-over-year increase, so that is not 12% of all customers.
Charles Fishman: Okay, got it. Thank you. That was it. End of Q&A
Operator: There are no further questions in the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Susan Giles: I just want to remind you all that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through November 8. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us this morning.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-05-08 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations Kim Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer Mike Haefner - President and Chief Operating Officer Bret Eckert - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Chris Turner - JPMorgan Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons Faisel Khan - Citigroup Charles Fishman - Morningstar Mark Levin - BB&T
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mrs. Susan Giles. Thank you, Mrs. Giles. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Selena and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the internet. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and Form 10-Q are all available on our website at atmosenergy.com. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 22 and more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Susan and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. If you would like to follow me on Slides 2 and 3 of the slide deck, you will see that realized net income for the quarter was $144 million or $1.40 per diluted share. For this current 6-month period realized net income was $240 million or $2.33 per diluted share. Positive rate outcomes in our regulated businesses drove our growth for the three and the six-month periods. Rate release for our regulated distribution and pipeline operations combined generated about $24 million of incremental margin in the quarter and about $48 million for the current six months. However, warmer than normal weather affected all segments of our business. For the quarter and six month periods, we experienced a 21% decrease in regulated distribution sales volumes due to weather that was 25% warmer quarter-over-quarter. However, our weather normalization mechanisms, which cover about 97% of utility margins, worked as designed during the warm heating season. As a result, gross profit decreased just $2.2 million for the quarter and $3.3 million for the six month period due to the warmer than normal weather. Additionally, although our regulated pipeline experience decreased through system volumes and lower storage and blending fees due to the warm weather in the current quarter, volumes are only down about 1% on a year-to-date basis. And in our non-regulated segment, we experienced higher settlement losses on long financial positions compared to both prior year periods. Focusing now on our spending, consolidated O&M was flat quarter-over-quarter but rose about $6 million in the current six months period primarily due to increased pipeline maintenance spending as well as the timing of spending period over period. Capital spending increased by $97 million in the first six months compared to one year ago primarily due to planned increases in spending in both of our regulated segments. About two-thirds of this increase was incurred in our regulated pipeline segment where we continue to enhance and fortify our Bethel and Tri-City storage fields to improve our ability to reliably deliver gas in the Mid-Tex division and APT’s other LDC customers. We remain on track to achieve our capital budget target of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016 as you will see in the slide deck. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, with the winter heating season coming to an end, we have tightened our projections and earnings per share range for fiscal 2016. As shown on Slide 12, we expect fiscal 2016 earnings per diluted share to range between $3.25 and $3.35 excluding unrealized margins at September 30, 2016. The expected contribution from our regulated operations as well as estimates for selected expenses for the year have been tightened from our original projections made last November. The expected contribution from our non-regulated operations remains unchanged. We expect the continued execution of our infrastructure investment strategy, coupled with constructive regulation will be the primary driver for this year’s results. Looking on Slide 13, we continue to anticipate annual operating income increases of between $100 million and $125 million from approved rate outcomes in the year. Thank you for your time. And I will now hand the call to our CEO, Kim Cocklin for closing remarks. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Bret very much and good morning everyone. Very good quarter. An excellent first half. As Bret said, we came through a warmer than normal winter in excellent shape. We are able to tighten guidance. And with the approval of the pipeline GRIP filing in Texas on May 3, we now have generated $71 million of revenues from rate outcomes, and as Bret said, are on target to achieve our target of $100 million to $125 million this year. We do have filings pending before agencies which seek a total of $56 million and we expect to file a few more cases before year end. These results very importantly mark our over five consecutive years of successfully executing our growth strategy that we began in 2011 and continues our journey in meeting the very important commitments of investing in our infrastructure to improve the safe operation of our system, to grow earnings at a level of 6% to 8% annually and to target a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. We now will open it up for questions. Selena?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Chris Turner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Turner: Good morning, guys. I wanted to check in on the pipeline rate case, I think you kind of last updated us by saying that you would file late this year early next year. What’s the latest on timing thoughts and cap structure kind of request versus your current?
Kim Cocklin: It’s pretty much on target is what we have been messaging you with. We intend to file it probably late this year, probably December. The cap structure we are targeting is still in the 57% to 58% equity component, which is what we anticipate having as we work through our financial plan for funding the capital budget this year. And really as we have talked about, we are going to file everything right down the middle of the fairway and not ask for anything outside that we don’t have in place right now. So, there really isn’t any change and we are on target to do everything that we have been talking to you about. If there is any changes we will have any updates at the AGA Financial Forum coming up in May, but we don’t anticipate having any.
Chris Turner: Okay. And then is it the right way to think about that case that you guys have recovered most of the capital return on and of already through the GRIP mechanism and most of the kind of wild card or uncertainty from our perspective that will flow through to your bottom line versus what you currently are getting is on the cost side?
Kim Cocklin: We will have an update to the rate base numbers obviously and we will have all our investment that we have made from the time of the GRIP filing this year through that end of that case and then we will be filing another GRIP filing after the case is filed. So, there will be additional increments to rate base in the case.
Chris Turner: Okay, great. And then can you remind us of when you expect to next be a cash taxpayer based on your current estimates and the changes with bonus depreciation late last year? And then also kind of maybe give an update on your expectations of using your ATM issuance mechanism that you recently launched in terms of timing this year and maybe next as well?
Kim Cocklin: First on the cash taxpayer, we don’t anticipate being a cash taxpayer in the current 5-year plan through 2020. So it will be after that, before we start to pay cash taxes. As far as the ATM Chris, the plans are consistent with what we disclosed at our November analyst day. We expect to do $300 million to $400 million over the 5-year plan and $50 million to $100 million on an annual basis.
Chris Turner: Okay. And would that be somewhat evenly spread throughout the year or would you do that kind of at certain points?
Kim Cocklin: I don’t – I think we are going to stick with the $50 million to $100 million as you go through that period. I will tell you that all of our financing plans have been contemplated and included in our tightened guidance range for fiscal ‘16, as well as our guidance that we have out there in 2020.
Chris Turner: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question is from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Spencer Joyce: Bret, Kim, Susan good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning. Spencer, who is the Derby winner this year?
Spencer Joyce: Well, I am sorry, that’s why I had to chime in. I am on the favorite. I kind of like Nyquist this year.
Kim Cocklin: Nyquil [ph]…?
Spencer Joyce: Yes, almost Nyquist. But in any case, just one sort of broad big picture question from me, you all have been very clear about why you have avoided latching on to some of the major midstream projects that we have seen here out East a little bit and at least from my vantage point, it seems like the environmental contingent is becoming more organized and a bit more vocal and we have seen delays for Constitution, PennEast, I mean almost any named project we have seen delays at this point. I am wondering if you have seen any of that public sentiment shift into some of your smaller diameter, shorter-haul projects or is it really just business as usual as far as your pipe in the ground goes?
Kim Cocklin: No that has – none of that consternation is translated into any of the projects that we have got and the capital investment we are doing. I mean the regulators and our customers understand how important it is for us to continue to pursue that investment to make our system as safe as possible and continue to – our journey of becoming the nation’s safest utility. So, we are also not trying to clear new right away or go through areas that have not – that don’t have pipe in the ground right now. So, it makes a significant difference when you are trying to put those new systems in and trying to clear a path for them and that there is a great deal of opposition that goes along. And then you have got the size of the pipe itself, those things are talking 36 inch, 42 inch pipe and unfortunately you have got some stuff that’s been in the news here lately, Bethlehem Township in Pennsylvania with the Texas Eastern incident last week. So it’s pretty much elevated the opposition, but for us I mean we continue to operate in a – in kind of under the radar. And people see the need. And it’s a small pipe in most situations where we are dealing with it. So, no.
Spencer Joyce: Alright, that sounds great, good color there and glad to hear its business as usual. That’s all I had, we will see you in Naples.
Kim Cocklin: Okay. Spencer, look forward to it.
Operator: The next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisel Khan: Hi, good morning. It’s Faisel from Citigroup.
Kim Cocklin: Faisel, where have you – I thought you were doing the Geico commercials or something. We haven’t heard from you in years.
Faisel Khan: Yes, it has been several quarters, since I have asked a question, but and think of where the stock has gone too. So it’s probably a good thing, right.
Kim Cocklin: Yes. We have got a good run.
Faisel Khan: Yes. Just a couple of questions for you and I will get out of the queue. Just on the – with the amount of rate cases that you have going on and going forward, if you can just remind us sort of what the history is and sort of the ask versus the settled, so what percentage you usually get from the ask for these rate cases when you settle them?
Bret Eckert: Keep in mind, Faisal we have got annual mechanisms that cover about 93% of our filings, so.
Kim Cocklin: These are not traditional filings. Normally, in a general rate case, you handicap the filed form out versus – the request versus the achieved at about 50%, but so many of our filings right now, as Bret pointed out 93% are covered by annual mechanisms that really have – are very prescriptive and there is not a lot of controversy over the computation and the methodology that’s utilized to increase either the O&M or the rate base adjustments. And then you have plug and play ingredients normally associated with the cap structure that may or may not change and the return component is normally settled. The depreciation rate is also settled. So, I mean we don’t – we have got the $56 million of – that we are seeking right now that is the filed for request. I mean we are – the best target that you can have for your model I think is to look at the $100 million to $125 million that we targeted for fiscal ‘16 that we are at $71 million now and we are very confident and comfortable that we will reach the target that we have provided. I mean as we get closer through the next two quarters you will see those amounts will continue to materialize and as they become final we make them immediately available so you can get them into your model.
Faisel Khan: Got it, okay. It makes sense.
Bret Eckert: If you look at slide 27 you will see a detail of each of those mechanisms by state, by jurisdiction.
Faisel Khan: Yes. No, I see it. I was just wondering, are you in for like for example, I guess for the Mid-Tex cities sort of are they RRM, like is that $26.6 million, is that sort of part of this process you are talking about where it’s an automatic sort of…?
Kim Cocklin: That is not automatic, but it’s pretty prescriptive. So, there is normally adjustment in the ask for that type of filing and what we achieve because that does go through some negotiation process.
Mike Haefner: Faisel, this is Mike. The other thing that we will see in terms of the difference between an ask and an awarded amount relates to assumptions that are made and debated around things like employee costs, how pension costs are treated in that, that at the end of the day may affect the awarded amount, but does not affect us on a net income basis at the end of the day, so.
Faisel Khan: Okay. And then looking at the continued rate base growth of the company going from I guess $5.5 billion to $9 billion, is there anything that would sort of cause that growth rate to slow for any which reason, I just want to make sure also is the deferred taxes and the implementation of the new tax laws, is that baked into that number too?
Bret Eckert: It’s fully been contemplated in all of our numbers, yes.
Kim Cocklin: You will be the first to know, Faisel. I mean we take that commitment extremely seriously. We have advertised that we are going to grow rate base at 9% to 10% which we absolutely have to do to meet the commitment of growing earnings at 6% to 8% on average. So I mean we have built up what we hope is a lot of trust and credibility with our shareholder base and with the street and we take that as seriously as the dividends. So if there is ever any change to that and if there is any retraction or reduction to the growth rate that we see, which we don’t see for the next 5 years and we have got a very good financial strategy to back up the investment for the next 5 years and we will continue to increase that. So we are very confident and again, we can’t overemphasize the fact that we are not just advertising these rates at 6% to 8%, we are actually performing and throwing them off and we have got over a 5-year track record of meeting that commitment. So we fully expect to do it. And we understand how important it is to message any change as soon as it becomes available. So we are not going to hide the ball on anything like that.
Faisel Khan: It makes sense. Thanks guys for the time. I appreciate it.
Kim Cocklin: See you Monday.
Faisel Khan: We will do.
Operator: The next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. You lowered the – you narrowed your guidance, but you lowered the upper end of your guidance, $3.40 to $3.35, yet the upper end of regulated operations stayed the same, the upper end of non-regulated operations stayed the same, share count stayed the same, can you explain to me your thinking on that of how you go about doing – or why you did that, lowered the upper end too?
Bret Eckert: Well, when you tighten guidance, Charles right, I mean you have got to move the upper and the lower end. The midpoint of our guidance is still the $3.30 that remains unchanged, which is about an 8.2% growth rate over the $3.05 weather adjusted operations for fiscal ‘15, so it was just a matter of coming in six months into the year when 70% to 75% of your earnings are behind you and providing a bit tighter of a range of guidance for the street.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So you are not – I see what you are doing, you are focusing on the midpoint and then just assuming a variance from that. Got it, okay. That explains that…
Kim Cocklin: We are also trying to focus on trying to help you tighten up your model.
Charles Fishman: Thank you. That’s always appreciated. The next question follows up tightening up the model, effective tax rate went down – guidance on effective tax rate went down 100 basis points, can you provide a little more color on that?
Kim Cocklin: That was Trump hew was – because he is the Republican nomination.
Charles Fishman: Okay.
Kim Cocklin: It’s just – really just the ebbs and flows you see in a year plus there was a new stock compensation standard that was adopted and that impacted tax rate – effective tax rate a little bit. And you will see that disclosed in the 10-Q.
Charles Fishman: Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Good quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mr. Mark Levin from BB&T. Please go ahead.
Mark Levin: Hi guys. Hope you are doing well. Two very big picture questions, the first has to do with something that I am sure is not envisioned by many at this point with natural gas prices around $2.10, but is there a point at which – or is there a gas price at which you could point to or maybe theoretically come to whereby regulators would be less inclined to be as constructive as they are. Put another way, is there a natural gas price point where the customer starts to feel it in a more material way and the regulatory environment might not be quite as accommodative as it is today?
Kim Cocklin: I mean you can hypotheticate all you want on prices for sure Mark, but we haven’t picked a price point. We do anticipate with our 5-year plan of having an all-in – we have assumed an all-in gas price of $4.50, $4.50 to $5.50 through 2020, which if you look at the forward screen, I mean that is clearly within the realm of reasonableness and even conservative. So there are some other factors. The cost of money is another thing that’s helping the investment and along with gas prices, the customers are not expected to experience any increase in the bills that they have paid since 2007. So I mean we really haven’t run the what-if scenario on that. We pay obviously, very close attention to gas prices and are able to do some things as a result of working with the regulators to hedge positions so that we are usually 1 year or 2 years ahead of all the price changes.
Mark Levin: Sure. So to me it sounds like – even if it were I think we are – gas would have to do something monumental – have to be monumentally higher?
Kim Cocklin: It would have to be like $8 to $10 I think.
Mark Levin: Yes, right. So a completely different schematic. And then the second question, because you can’t get off an LDC call without asking the M&A question, but maybe I will approach it from a different way, are you seeing any opportunities – obviously, your equity has risen magnificently and for good reason, but you do have an equity currency, the cost of debt is relatively cheap – is very cheap actually. Are there opportunities out there as a buyer, now I realize going and trying to buy an LDC and finding a cheap LDC at this point might be challenging, but are there any other opportunities out there that you guys are considering or would consider given the strength of your equity and the cost of debt?
Kim Cocklin: We pretty – we have been very consistent in emphasizing the fact that we think multiples are extremely expensive, you never say never. But there is nothing on the block that we would be interested in paying over and above or even close to what’s going off the Board today, if you look at our investment of $1 billion to $1.1 billion of capital every year, that with the regulatory lag that we experience with 94% of that investment beginning to earn within six months at the end of the test period, that $1 billion to $1.1 billion that we are putting in the ground is helping us on this journey of becoming the nation’s safest utility, so it becomes immediately accretive. You don’t have the integration issues if you go out and overpay for an asset which you are doing right now. You have regulatory issues and complications of dealing with what you pay over book, how you deal with goodwill, how you integrate a culture, you do the systems. I mean there is a whole host of issues, social issues and financial and operational issues, when you buy an asset. I mean we did that, we have a wonderful asset – we have a wonderful portfolio. We are in jurisdictions where we want to be. We are extremely comfortable with who we are. We know who we want to be. We have got wonderful skill sets. And so we don’t really have to look across the landscape. And I think bet the future on trying to integrate an asset under the current market conditions.
Mark Levin: That makes perfect mix, absolutely perfect sense. And is your – just when you think about the industry as a whole and you put your sort of crystal ball on – head on and think about the next 6 months to 12 months, is your expectation that we will continue to see more deals or do you think that there will be a pause given the run in the equities?
Kim Cocklin: No pause. There is going to be more deals. I mean you have got people out there that supine gas is a very attractive story. They want to get it in their portfolio if they do not have it right now and natural gas. Obviously, it’s the future for energy in this country. I mean energy is a very fundamental food group of a healthy economy. Once we get past November and the elections I think with where gas prices are and where exploration efforts are in the country and the ability – it’s an affordable all-American product. So it makes all the sense in the world and there is good reason I mean I don’t think – I think the multiples are going to stay where they are at in this space as well, because I think interest rates will probably remain very low, but I think people are seeing a lot of value right now and continue to see value in natural gas.
Mark Levin: That all makes sense, congratulations on a great execution.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Susan Giles for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Selena. I just want to say thank you for calling. A recording of this call is available for replay on the website through August 3. And we hope to see many of you at the AGA Financial Forum in a couple of weeks. Thank you again for your interest in Atmos Energy. Bye-bye.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-02-03 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations Kim Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer Mike Haefner - President and Chief Operating Officer Bret Eckert - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Giles, you may now begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Manny, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation and Form 10-Q are all available on our website at AtmosEnergy.com.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results.  The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 17, and more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Mr. Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. 
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.  Reported net income for the quarter was $103 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $98 million or $0.96 one year ago. Excluding unrealized margins in both periods net income was $96 million or $0.93 per diluted share compared to $93 million or $0.91 last year. Slides 3 and 4 provide financial highlights for our regulated operations for the three month period. The continued pursuit of our infrastructure investment strategy drove our quarter-over-quarter growth. Rate released through our regulated distribution and pipeline operations combined generated about $24 million of incremental margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. About $14 million of this amount came from our regulated distribution segment with about $7 million in our Mid-Tex division and the remainder from our Mississippi and West Texas divisions. The remaining $10 million came from the regulated pipeline segment primarily as the result of new rates from the approved 2015 GRIP filing. Additionally our weather normalization mechanisms, which over about 97% of utility margins, [worked its design] insulating both the company and our customers during atypical weather. We experienced a 21% quarter-over-quarter decrease in regulated distribution sales volumes due to the weather that was 29% warmer than last year’s quarter. However, gross profit decreased just $1.1 million. Focusing now on our spending as expected consolidated O&M increased by about $6 million quarter-over-quarter mainly due to incremental pipeline maintenance spending, as well as increased administrative expense in our regulated operations. Capital expenditures increased by $30 million in the first quarter compared to one year ago, despite the particularly challenging weather conditions in Texas during the quarter, which slowed several regulated distribution projects during the period. However, spending in our regulated pipeline segment increased as we continued to enhance and fortify our Bethel and Tri-City storage fields. These efforts will improve our ability to reliably deliver gas to our North Texas customers and serve the peak day requirement of the Mid-Tex division and ATT’s other LDC customers. We remain on track to achieve our capital budget target of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016 as detailed on Slide 15. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we still expect fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be in the previously announced range of $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins at September 30, 2016 and that is shown on Slide 12. The expected contribution from our regulated and non-regulated operation as well as estimates for selected expenses for the year remain unchanged since we announced fiscal 2016 projections last November, and we expect the continued execution of our infrastructure investment strategy coupled with constructive regulation to be the primary driver for this year’s results. Looking at slide 13, we anticipate annual operating income increases of between $100 million to $125 million from implemented rate outcomes this year. Thank you for your time and now I will hand the call to our CEO, Kim Cocklin, for closing remarks. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Bret. Excellent report. We have reported a very solid start to this fiscal 2016 and are very encouraged with the expectations for the full year. Without question the weather event this past quarter presented a number of challenges. Our West Texas division endured a record blizzard, while our Mid-Tex division encountered a series of deadly tornadoes and record rainfall in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The devastating weather in Texas tested the reliability of our system and the good news is that the capital improvements we have made to our distribution system and the extensive training of our field employees proved to be both valuable and effective while operating safely and reliably during these challenging conditions. We also achieved very solid progress in the [rates] this first quarter. In Kansas, a settlement was reached and supported by all parties that will benefit our customers over the long term and there is now pending action before the Kansas Corporation Commission. In Colorado, we received approval for a Systems Safety and Integrity Rider, which is a forward-looking infrastructure investment mechanism effective January 1 of this year for a three year term. And in Mississippi we have a system integrity rider, which is also a forward-looking infrastructure mechanism. These important changes continued to demonstrate that fair and balanced regulation will continue to support our journey to becoming the nation’s safest utility with an annual capital investment of over $1 billion. Rate outcomes have provided annual operating increases of about $12 million and we have filed cases now pending which seek about $33 million of annual operating income increases. We expect to make between 12 to 15 more filings this fiscal year, which will request between $90 million to $100 million of additional operating income increases. Slide 14 provides a summary of our expected fiscal ’16 rate filings. We are off to a solid start and our performance continues the track record of meeting our commitments to invest in our regulated assets, growing our rate base and earnings and maintaining an unwavering attitude to strive to become the nation’s safest utility. Year-over-year our weighted average cost of gas has decreased, which will continue to help and alleviate any upward rate pressure associated with our increased capital spending. Our balance sheet remains very healthy and our credit ratings are strong. Our debt capital ratio at December 31 was essentially flat year-over-year at 49.6%. We remain focused on spending between $1 billion to $1.4 billion of capital annually through fiscal 2020. We believe our internal capital investment opportunities will enable rate based growth, which would generate earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2020. Yesterday our board declared our 129th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.42. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal ’16 is $1.68, which is a 7.7% increase over last year. With projected earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% coupled with our dividend yield we are committing to delivering total shareholder return in the 9% to 11% range through fiscal ’20. Thank you for your time and now we will open the call up for questions. Manny?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Brian Russo: Hi, good morning.
Bret Eckert: Good morning Brian.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning.
Brian Russo: I noticed that the rate base slide and the financing need slide is, as you mentioned, consistent with the assumptions laid out at your analyst conference in November, and I am just curious was there any impact to bonus depreciation since the assumptions in November or did November capture your outlook for bonus depreciation?
Bret Eckert: Brian, this is Bret Eckert. The impact of the extension of bonus at the 50% level really doesn’t have any significant impact on us in ’16 or really over the five-year plan.
Brian Russo: And why is that exactly?
Bret Eckert: It has a small impact from a cash basis percentage. But outside of that the impact on rate base is very small.
Brian Russo: Okay, and then also just on the rate base slide, if you just take your rate base plus CapEx minus depreciation it seems like that calculation is higher than the illustrated assumptions in your annual rate base growth through 2020 and I was just wondering what other adjustments are included in that adjusted for taxes?
Bret Eckert: Yes, I think that it is mainly just timing Brian, you take it at a period end or you are taking on cases that are in progress or approved rate base that is already approved. I think you're just seeing the timing of annual rate making when you have got fiscal year-end at September 30, and you have rate filings throughout the year.
Brian Russo: Got it, understood. And the debt-to-cap ratio at 49.6% that seems lower than maybe what the assumption is for the full year or the trend in the debt-to-cap ratio and I'm just curious is it just the seasonality of the retained earnings?
Bret Eckert: Yes, it is really just the seasonality as your short-term debt balances are higher at the end of December than they are at the end of September. That really is just the timing and then as collections come in as you go through the winter heating season that balance comes back down. So really it is driven by timing. Everything that we discussed with regard to our financing plan is consistent with what we have laid out in November.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. And then lastly I noticed in the non-reg segment unit margins increased to $0.12 per Mcf versus $0.10, is that sustainable?
Bret Eckert : I think when you look at the guidance of the $14 million to $19 million we reaffirmed, the same guidance that we provided in November and so, I would still expect the earnings to come in at that range. Some of it is timing as you go throughout the year, but nothing has changed from our previous income projections for them.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Spencer Joyce of Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Spencer Joyce: Hi, good morning guys and Susan as well. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Bret Eckert: Good morning Spencer.
Kim Cocklin: It is good to hear your voice. Thank you.
Spencer Joyce: Yes. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year. It has been a while. Just a couple of quick ones here from me, first I know Kim you mentioned a couple of special or not special weather items from the first quarter here. Would it be safe to assume there was a bit of additional O&M expense housed in the first quarter and maybe for projecting kind of 2Q ’17 maybe we will see a little bit of a give back or perhaps a pullback in the growth rate there?
Bret Eckert: I think, Spencer it is Bret, a little of that is just timing. We did have an increase as expected in O&M in the quarter. The O&M projected range that we provided back in November still holds today. So a lot of that is just going to be timing of spend. We did have some wet weather in some of our jurisdictions that impacted capital and O&M a little bit but on a full year basis we expect it to come in at the levels that we previously provided.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, perfect. And then more broadly, I know you all had been fairly steadfast in relaying that you are fairly insulated from a lot of the malaise that we have seen in the oil and gas markets and even in Texas I know the direct exposure of the economy to energy is fairly small, but can you just hold our hand a little bit more there and let us know kind of how you are doing in the context of what it feels like it could be a tougher economic environment there in Texas?
Kim Cocklin: Hi Spencer this is Kim. No, we really don't expect – we haven't noticed any changes particularly in Texas and the other major metropolitan areas that we are servicing and Louisiana and Mississippi, let us say Kentucky, Tennessee, Colorado, Kansas, even around the Blacksburg area, I mean everything continues to be better than what is being reported. I think there is a whole lot of information coming out of the financial channels right now that everybody expecting kind of a rocky ’16 for the stock market, and that a lot of that is driven by what is happening according to them in China and then some of the energy prices bouncing around, but we continue to be a significant beneficiary of lower energy prices and a strong dollar. We are controlling everything that we can control and so I think the other thing is the Fed probably is going to push back any kind of increase on the rate as well. So, I think that is going to bode well for utilities. So I think you are certainly in the right space and you are certainly right on target having Atmos as your top pick in 2016.
Spencer Joyce: So far, so good.
Kim Cocklin: Damn right. I mean, yes, you are all about it. You have been right for a good while now for the last three years.
Spencer Joyce: It is a good thing I'm on a call now. I'm blushing a bit. But all right, again nice quarter and we will talk soon.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you.
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Spencer.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Charles Fishman: Thank you. Just as a follow-up to that last question, I realized the insulation you have from commodity prices, but does the volatility help your non-regulated segment at all?
Bret Eckert: Go ahead Mike.
Mike Haefner: This is Mike Charles. Our non-reg segment really – primarily is focused on our delivered gas business, where they are really managing the aggregation of supply in the pipeline and storage contracts to get gas to municipalities, other LDCs and small industrial. So it is really not – we are really not affected by that and we run a flat book. We don’t take any risk. In the market we get a little bit of lift out of our facility, but it is just – it is miniscule.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So maybe the lower earnings from non-regulated quarter-to-quarter which I realize is just one quarter is really more volume driven than anything else, correct?
Mike Haefner: It is just timing.
Bret Eckert: Yes, it is just timing.
Charles Fishman: Okay. 
Kim Cocklin: Charles, that business is all about managing risk and we are not about to try to take advantage of any volatility, we are going to run a flat book and as Bret said, and we continue to emphasize at every meeting we have with analysts, they are plugged in at about $14 million to $19 million of net income this year and every year till 2020. We are not encouraging them to grow, but we are encouraging them to be a value added service provider to the smaller municipalities, commercial industrial customers that need energy management expertise, which is what they bring to the table and have done so each and every year, demonstrated by their performance in the Masteo customer survey where they have came in at number one or number two the last five years. So we are very proud of that fact. But they do provide an extremely valuable service to the smaller customers that are situated behind our, the distribution utilities that we serve in eight states. And again it is energy management expertise for those people that don't have it on staff.
Charles Fishman: And then Kim, just as a macro view of the industry, we saw a similar company in Salt Lake did acquire an announced acquisition earlier this week, at a price that was somewhat lower than some of the other premiums we have seen. Do you have any thoughts as far as the industry that we have reached the peak of maybe some of the multiples already?
Kim Cocklin: No, I don’t think so. I think you guys are better versed at looking at some of the parts than some of us, but if you – you got to factor in the business model that is being pursued in some of the parts of any that resides in the portfolio. So there is a difference I think between a peer regulated natural gas utility where 95% of the earnings are coming from distribution and intrastate pipeline in Texas versus other folks that may have a little bit more spread out with the non-regulated or they may have some MLP eligible assets in the form of an interstate pipeline or some midstream operations or even regulated production.
Charles Fishman: Okay. That is all I have. Thank you. That was quite helpful.
Bret Eckert: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.
Susan Giles: Good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning Stephen.
Stephen Byrd:
, :
Bret Eckert: Hi Stephen, it is Bret Eckert, as we reaffirm, we still expect that regulatory outcomes on an annualized basis will be $100 million to $125 million in fiscal ’16, we continue to really focus on the execution of our capital spend and continuing to partner with our regulators in our annual filing. A lot of what we have got now is just continued execution. Kim highlighted the new mechanisms last year that we got in Tennessee, in Mississippi. We had a new mechanism in Colorado for infrastructure that went into effect on 1st January and then he commented on what we are doing in Kansas. And so, it is just the continued effort of what you have seen in previous years to be able to always focus on finding ways to continue to reduce regulatory lag, but things are continuing to progress as we expected.
Kim Cocklin: I mean, we are measuring this in baby steps and very incremental byte-sized pieces Stephen and I think, the resolution that we achieved with our customers and the staff and now that is being reviewed before the KCC in Kansas is something that we think is a very positive step in the right direction and then as Bret said, we pointed out the forward-looking infrastructure mechanism in Colorado and Mississippi both identified for capital. So I mean we feel very good and I mean every filing that we make we are trying to educate the staff and the regulators that we are talking to about the continued need to reduce lag in order to facilitate the investment in this journey to safety that we are on right now. I think we are spending about three times – the depreciation rate is only – can only be done as long as you have a manageable lag process that we are continuing to focus on. So we feel good and we are going to continue to try to do better.
Stephen Byrd: That makes perfect sense. My last question, I think I have got a good sense for the answer, but I feel compelled to ask it anyway just following up on the M&A environment that we are seeing, it is clear that there is still a lot of capital available, there is still likely to be strong valuations for really high quality, high growth companies, I am just curious in terms of your reaction to the continued pace of M&A activity, how do you think about that in the context of your own company versus your own standalone growth plans?
Bret Eckert: Well, I mean, we have been in the camp that we thought the M&A activity would not slow down and it started to heat up at the end of ’15 and it has just continued through ’16 and I think you are going to see a continuation of that activity in this pace. I mean I think that the companies that remain on the board have to be extremely attractive and have some very good business models and bring to the table some platforms that don't exist for some of these – for some of the folks that are going up and down the shopping isles at the present time. So, we have got a great plan. We have got a great strategy. I mean I think there is a lot of good companies out there like us as well. You have got to have a better handle on it than we do, I mean, you've got to think please don't grow to the sky and the multiples that where the companies are trading seem to be extremely rich, but we continue to represent that we are an attractive opportunity for prudent investors with just the metrics that we are throwing out and that we are committed to deliver and that the results that we are putting forth justify putting this in your portfolio.
Stephen Byrd: Well said, very much understood. Thank you.
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Levin of BB&T. Please go ahead.
Mark Levin: Hi guys. Very solid quarter and a very difficult market environment. Just a quick question and it maybe just entirely too early to answer it, but I will throw it out there anyway. The $3.20 to $3.40 guidance that you reaffirmed, maybe you can, having gone through at least one quarter give us some idea of how you feel about that range, it is reasonably wide, maybe there are two or three factors that you think are critical towards getting to the upper end and the two or three factors that could lead you to the lower end of the range?
Bret Eckert: Hi Mark it is Bret. I mean, you heard earlier yes, we did reaffirm that guidance of $3.20 to $3.40, we would look potentially to look totighten that guidance later in the year, butwe absolutely remain on track. As you said, the first quarter was a solid first quarter. It came in right in line with our expectation and we still remain very well positioned to achieve that $3.20 to $3.40 guidance range.
Kim Cocklin: This is a difficult market environment and we are up a bit above 10% year-to-date, we will take it.
Mark Levin: I know you guys are doing everything you can. Great…
Kim Cocklin: We are [battling] fast and furious, [Indiscernible].
Mark Levin: Absolutely. All right, well thank you guys and congratulations on a good quarter.
Bret Eckert: Thank you Mark.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.
Susan Giles: I just want to say that a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through May 4. And again we appreciate your interest and thank you for joining us. Bye-bye.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - VP of IR Kim Cocklin - President and CEO Bret Eckert - SVP & CFO
Analysts: Charles Fishman - Morningstar Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.\ At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, CEO, and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our Leadership Team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on the website, and to access these materials, please visit our website at AtmosEnergy.com. We will refer to just a few of slides during this live call, but we are happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. Also, we expect to file a Form 10-K tomorrow. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see slide 25 more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements, and where to go to get more information about them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Susan, very much, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your continued interest and investment in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we recorded earnings of $3.09 per diluted share for fiscal '15, representing the 13th consecutive year of increasing earnings per share. Our performance continues to reflect the successful execution of our strategy with the goal of becoming the nation's safest utility. And our journey to safety has required and will continue to require a significant capital investment, as well as a strong partnership, built on relationships with our regulators and the communities and customers we serve. Finally, it requires exceptional employees who are well-trained and take pride in rendering an essential safe service. Since commencing our journey to safety in our fiscal 2012, we've invested about $2.7 billion in safety and reliability, which has fortified and significantly upgraded our distribution and transmission system. The investments are only possible because of again, the good relationships that have been achieved with the communities we serve and the regulators who recognize the critical need to balance the interests of consumers and businesses like Atmos Energy. While safety is a primary goal of our strategy, shareholders have also benefited with the total return during fiscal 2015 of 25.5%, and since 2012, a total return of 106%. As a result of this strong performance, our Board of Directors authorized a 7.7% increase to our quarterly dividend. The fiscal '16 indicated dividend rate is now $1.68, an increase of $0.12. This is the 32nd consecutive year of increasing the dividend. The increase reflects our commitment to providing an attractive return to our investors, while continuing to execute our growth strategy by reinvesting capital in our system. Additionally, our liquidity, financial position, and balance sheet remain strong. In September, we replaced our revolving $1.25 billion credit facility with a new facility effective through September 2020 on substantially the same terms. The credit facility also retained the $250 million accordion feature that expands our borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion. At the end of September, we had almost $1 billion of capacity from our short-term facilities, and our debt to capital ratio at September 30, 2015 was 47.7%. Finally, I want to comment on the recent promotions we announced for the management committee and senior leadership team. Mike Haefner has moved from his role as Executive Vice President, to the President and Chief Operating Officer, effective October 1. Mike will be with us and present at the analyst day later this month. A very important responsibility of the Board of Directors is to ensure a succession plan that exists which is seamless, transparent, and continues the successful growth of the company. Any successful succession plan is also one that is controlled by the Company, one is that is not required by poor performance, poor health or financial distress. Our plan has been very deliberate and carefully considered, and reflects the Board's confidence that it will be successful. Mike has been within a Senior Leadership role for seven years, and is now responsible for all the businesses in our portfolio, the pipeline, and the utility, and the marketing company. We also appointed Marvin Sweetin to the new role of Senior Vice President of Safety and Enterprise Services. We recognize our business, being a utility, totally depends on being safe, and the primary mission of our existence is safety. The straw that stirs the drink is safety. Without safety, every other metric is severely crippled, negatively impacted, and without merit. Federal and state regulations will continue to be issued and clarified, and compliance will become more challenging. Over 80% of our capital is spent on safety. We have to elevate our game, and we have, with this new senior management position, reporting to the CEO and with a seat on the management committee. Marvin brings the background, the experience and education necessary to make this position successful. Fiscal '15 was a remarkable year on many accounts, and our financial performance followed. Bret Eckert, our CFO, will review the financial results in greater detail, and then we'll return for closing comments and questions. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Kim and good morning, everybody. My remarks will primarily focus on the full-year results. Slides 3 and 4 detail reported net income and income excluding net unrealized margins for the three and 12-month periods of fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Reported earnings were $315 million or $3.09 per diluted share this year, compared with $290 million, or $2.96 per diluted share last year. Earnings excluding unrealized margins were $316 million, or $3.10 per diluted share in fiscal 2015, compared with $284 million, or $2.90 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. Also, fiscal 2015 earnings included the impact of colder than normal weather of $4.8 million, or $0.05 per share compared with $17.1 million, or $0.17 per share in fiscal 2014. Consolidated results for the year benefited from rate outcomes implemented in fiscal 2014 and 2015, and weather that was 8% colder than normal. Overall, spending levels for maintenance and capital activities were in line with expectations. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of enhancing the safety and reliability of our infrastructure, coupled with constructive regulation in our service areas. Slides Five and Six provide financial highlights for our regulated operations for the three and 12-month periods. The execution of the regulatory strategy continues to drive our financial performance. Rate increases had a positive effect during the year, lifting distribution gross profit by about $71 million, and regulated pipeline gross profit by another $47 million. For the year, the annualized operating income increases from rate activity implemented during fiscal 2015 was $92 million. Slides Seven through 15 provide more detail on our rate filings in fiscal 2015. Our non-regulated operations continued its focus on the delivered gas business and represented about 5% of consolidated earnings this year, which is in line with their expected contribution level. Details on our non-regulated segment can be found on slide 16. Shifting now to the expense side of the income statement, as expected, O&M increased by about $18 million in the quarter and $37 million in fiscal 2015. In both periods, we experienced anticipated higher levels of pipeline maintenance expenses. In addition, we experienced increased employee-related costs. Interest charges decreased by $13 million for the year, primarily due to replacing the $500 million of 10-year debt with $500 million of 30-year debt at a lower rate back in October of 2014. As we anticipated, capital expenditures increased by about $140 million this year to $975 million. Over 80% of the capital expenditures were associated with safety and reliability spending, and we will be earning on over 90% of capital expenditures within six months of test year end. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016, we have announced our fiscal 2016 earnings per share guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins. Slides 19 and 20 detail our net income and expense projections for fiscal 2016. The midpoint of fiscal 2016 guidance represent an 8.2% earnings per share growth rate from the weather-adjusted 2015 earnings of $3.05, excluding unrealized margins. All of our growth in fiscal 2016 is expected to be driven by our regulated operations. We project regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $315 million to $335 million. We continue to expect constructive rate outcomes to be the primary driver of next year's results, and we anticipate receiving annualized increases from implemented rate activity in fiscal 2016 of between $100 million and $125 million. Our non-regulated business is expected to remain flat relative to fiscal 2015 levels, and generate net income in the $14 million to $19 million range, driven by its core delivered gas business. Non-regulated earnings are expected to contribute 5% or less of consolidated earnings in 2016. Consolidated net income for fiscal 2016 is expected to range between $329 million and $354 million, and average diluted shares are expected to range from 103 million to 105 million shares. O&M expense is projected to range between $535 million and $560 million, with a continued emphasis on pipeline maintenance spending. Additionally, our budget assumes normal weather. Other assumptions are detailed on slide 20. Slide 23 details our capital budget and its expected range of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. This will allow us to continue our focus on systems safety and infrastructure spending, to fortify our natural gas delivery system. Thank you for your time, and now I'll hand the call back to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Bret, what a report and what a year. By all measures, it was an excellent year and history is going to be very, very kind to Atmos when we look back on this year. Our performance and the execution of our strategy continues to build credibility and trust with our key constituents, regulators, customers, employees and shareholders. We were among the first to recognize by partnering with our regulation communities and taking advantage of very favorable market conditions that we could significantly increase capital investments to improve the safety of our system and services, and grow shareholder value. We continue to have the wind at our back like others in this business, as commodity prices remain low, and reliable forecasts continue to identify long-term prices that will remain extremely competitive and affordable to customers from an abundant supply of available natural gas. We believe these market conditions will allow us to continue to render very safe and reliable service at a competitive price. Our strategy of investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use of our capital. These capital investments are projected to grow rate base by 9% to 10%, earnings per share by 6% to 8% on an annual basis, and provide a projected total return to shareholders of 9% to 11%. I know we sound like a broken record, but it can't be repeated often enough in today's challenging economy and volatile stock market. We continue to improve on our daily trade volume, our stock price and our market capitalization. We're getting out and we're sharing our growth strategy at every opportunity to support this journey to safety.

We continue to have a very solid plan through 2020, which we look forward to discussing at our upcoming Analyst Meeting. We appreciate your time this morning, and we're certainly ready to take any questions. Rob?
Operator: Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. O&M, on regulated pipeline, was up significantly 2015 over 2014, and I realize you just gave guidance for O&M of all the regulated operations for 2016, but it looked sort of flat. I look at the footnotes, a little over $27 million in the increased maintenance, higher employee-related expenses. Can I assume a lot of that was the incentive payments, at least in 2015, just because you had such a terrific year?
Bret Eckert: Well a portion of that was, but really the bigger driver, and it was anticipated, was the continued spending at the pipeline for increased pipeline integrity maintenance work. That's federal and state pipeline safety compliance work. The regulations continue to get stronger every single year, and that plans compliance for items such as integrity management smart digging, hydrostatic testing, you're doing right of way maintenance, and that's going to continue to be an area of focus for the pipeline in 2016.
Charles Fishman: And that is not capitalized just because that's a step up in preventative maintenance, that's ongoing annual type O&M?
Bret Eckert: It's just recurring annual maintenance, the pegging of the pipe and things of that nature is expense, the facilities, the launchers and things of that nature, that would be a capital item -- but the process of pegging or hydrostatic testing or right of way clearing is all maintenance expense.
Charles Fishman: And I assume all that's recognized in the rate cases?
Bret Eckert: Correct.
Charles Fishman: Okay. Thank you. That was it.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi. Good morning.
Bret Eckert: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Just curious, the debt to cap ratio of 47.7%, looking forward, will we see that trend higher or lower through retained earnings and the issuance of more debt?
Bret Eckert: Yes. Good question. We're going to be -- we've got our analyst day on the 18th of November. We will be announcing our spending levels. Right now our plan goes through 2018, we're going to be announcing the spending levels through 2020, and we'll update the earnings per share growth rate through 2020, and we'll put out guidance for fiscal year 2020, and we'll also talk about how we're going to fund that growth over that period.
Brian Russo: Okay. Great. I'll wait for that. I realize you've got well above average and robust rate based growth of 9% to 10% but I'm just curious, could you possibly increase your multi-year CapEx more than the level it is now, without having to issue equity and without having customers experience rate shock?
Bret Eckert: One of the things we'll update when we come up with our updated five-year plan is the slide that we have in our deck currently that talks about the impacts to the customer, and we'll run that through 2020, and I think you will continue to see that we're able to make these levels of investments to fund it in a balanced way and to not have an impact on the customer.
Brian Russo: Got it. Are there any other refinancing opportunities over the next couple of years?
Bret Eckert: The next expiring tranche debt is our June of 2017, senior notes, $250 million. We do have a forward starting swap that has fixed that rate, and then the next expiring tranche is March of 2019 $450 million senior note.
Brian Russo: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Susan Giles.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Rob, and I just want to remind everyone that a recording of this call is available for a replay on our website through February 3. We appreciate your interest in Atmos and thank you for joining us. Goodbye.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Susan Giles:
Susan Giles: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and our Form 10-Q we filed last night are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we'll take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 21 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on these risks and uncertainties. Now I would like to turn the call over to our President and CEO Mr. Kim Cocklin. Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us this morning and your continued interest in our company Atmos Energy. Yesterday as you are aware we reported consiolidated net income of about $56 million or $0.55 per diluted share. For the first nine months of fiscal 2015 the reported consolidated debt income was about $292 million or $2.86 per diluted share. Company’s performance during the quarter offers yet another confirmation at our long-term strategy to grow by investing in the safety and reliability of our regulated infrastructure continues to generate consistent operational and financial results. As a result we are pleased to increase our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance to a range between $3.10 from the previously announced ranges between $2.90 and $3.05 per diluted share. Bret will provide a little bit more color around that in his remarks. The execution of our strategy has also allowed us to strengthen our financial position and this was recognized was Fitch when they upgraded our long-term debt rating to A from A minus on July 1. Our debt capital ratio of June 30 was 45.5 % and all liquidity remained strong with over $1 billion of capacity available from our credit facilities. Yesterday our board declared our 127 consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2015 is a $1.56 per share. I’m going to turn the call over to our CFO Bret Eckert for more detailed discussion of the results. Bret.
Bret Eckert: Thanks Kim, and good morning to everyone. Slides 2 and 3 detail reported net income an income excluding net unrealized margins to the three and nine month periods of fiscal year 2015 and 2014. Earnings excluding unrealized margins for the current three month were $55 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus $46 million $0.45 per diluted share in prior year quarter. Earnings excluding unrealized margins for the current nine months were $287 million or $2.81 per diluted share compared with $259 million or $2.69 per diluted share of last year. Remember last year’s nine months results included the favorable impact was significantly colder than normal weather. Slides 4and 5, provides financial highlights for our regulated operations. In the quarter rate increases lifted distribution gross profit by $16 million and about $62 million for the current nine-months. At APT approved GRIP filings in fiscal 2014 and 2015 listed margins by over $9 million in the quarter and $37 million for the nine-months. However, period-over-period results in our distribution segment were negatively impacted that by weather that was 31% warmer than the prior year quarter and 9% warmer than the prior year nine-months. This reduced gross profit by about $1 million for the quarter and $9 million for the nine-month period. On non regulated segment is detailed on Slide 15 and 16, delivered gas increased in both the quarter and year-to-date period driven by stronger per unit margin offset by a slight decrease in delivered gas volumes. Other margins decreased about $3 million in the quarter and $17 million in the current nine-month as less volatile market conditions created few opportunities to capture incremental gross profit compared to the same periods one year ago. Shifting now to the income statement O&M increase by about $7 million in the quarter and about $18 million for the current nine-months. As we expected both period of experience higher levels of pipeline maintenance writeaway expenses despite a very wet spring that impacted the amount of maintenance that could to be performed. We do anticipate the maintenance expenses to continue and accelerate fourth quarter as the whether rise out. In addition, the current quarter saw increased employee related costs associated with the timing of the recognition of higher variable incentive compensation expense as a result of increased operating results these increases will partially offset by lower legal expense. Interest charges decreased by $4 in the quarter and about $10 million for the nine-months primarily due to replacing the $500 million of 10 year debt with $500 million of debt at a lower rate back in October 2014. Details of capital spending represented on Slide 6, over 80% of our capital expenditures were associated with safety and reliability spending, as we activated CapEx increased by about $115 million current nine month period compared to one year ago. Moving now earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 and you may want to turn to Slide 18 where we've detailed revised contributions from our regulated and our non-regulated operations as well as selected expenses for the year. As Kim mentioned, we have tightened and slightly increased the earnings guidance range for fiscal 2015 with earnings per diluted share now expected to range from $3 to $3.10 excluding unrealized margin. We now project regulated operations generate net income in the range of $290 million and $305 million and non-regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $14 million to $18 million. The updated guidance primarily reflects stronger than anticipated consumption in our distributions segment. This increased consumption levels not only reflect the impact of colder than normal experienced during the winter heating season, but also higher than anticipated residential and commercial consumption level following the winter heating season. We also expect higher realized non-regulated gross profit as a result of the improved delivered gas performance. Consolidated O&M expense is now expected to range from $525 million to $535 million driven by increased regulated pipeline maintenance activities and higher employee related variable incentive compensation expense. Turning to Slide 28, we now anticipate the annual operating income impact for rate outcome implemented in fiscal 2015 to range from $85 million to $95 million. This is slightly different than our original projection largely due to increased customer consumption experienced in the prior fiscal year. As a result, test period revenues were higher which reduced the size of requested rate increases. Thank you for your time and now I’ll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much for that report, Bret. Our performance again confirms that what we’re doing is working. We are experiencing very good results all around both operationally and financially as we strive to become the nation’s safest gas utility. We’ve fostered good relationship with our regulators who are tasked with balancing the needs to consumers and businesses like Atmos Energy and we’ve also built and established partnership with them as well as our customers, employees, in the cities we serve. Our regulated operations as Bret said continue to provide stable and predictable earnings for the enterprise. As of August 5, rate outcomes and incremental differals that provided annual operating increases of about $87 million thus far in fiscal 2015. Rate actions that are filed and pending total about another $9 million of requested annual operating increases. We expect to file another three to four cases this fiscal year that combined that would request anywhere from $15 million to $20 million of additional increases to operating income. As you are well aware safety is our number one priority and it does require significant investment both capital and expense. As gas prices remain low for the foreseeable future, the price dynamic continues to facilitate the investment we’re committed to making. This year we’ll spend from $900 million to $1 billion of capital to fortify our system. You’ve heard this bfore, we may sound like a broken record or you might think you are watching the movie Ground Hog Day, but we have been and will continue to delivery on our promises and commitment. Investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use of our capital. These capital investments should grow rate base by 9% to 10% and earnings per share by 6% to 8% on an annual basis and provide a projected total return to shareholders of between 9% and 11%. In November, we’ll look forward to meeting with you and communicating our refreshed five year plan, which will provide projections through fiscal 2020. We certainly appreciate your time this morning and now we’ll take any questions that you have, Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi, good morning.
Bret Eckert: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Just in terms of the increased guidance, if you kind of back into the EPS for the reg or non-reg, it looks like it’s split fairly evenly $0.05 of EPS increase on reg another $0.05 on regulated side. Is that just sustainable or is it related to weather and it’s not - and it shouldn’t really re-occur when meeting is the base earnings power $0.10 higher now than it was previously?
Bret Eckert: Well as we had said last call Brian it’s few questions, we expect weather to weather consumption to contribute about $0.04 to $0.06 to earnings in fiscal 2015, we talked about the delivery gas business with the slight increase in our guidance that really is driven by the delivery gas business, we see per unit margins strengthened though in end of the year expecting margins in the $0.10 to $0.11 range you see in margins closer to the $0.11 to $0.12 range and that is really what is causing the lift in that business. So we’re only coming out with guidance for fiscal 2016 as we announce our full-year results in November but those are the main drivers of the increase in earnings this year.
Brian Russo: Now the increase in unit margins on the non-reg side, is that sustainable?
Bret Eckert: That’s a good question Brian. I mean we didn’t experience that same performance last year from them and this year was then the trend increase for their margins and we’re also seeing increased consumption in on the regulated side of the business. I think that there is some traction that is being gained nationwide by energy consumers that are recognized that natural gas is an extremely good purchase and it continues to lead the way. So we’re seeing that, they are seeing some of that in the industrial sector but and the other thing is that their delivered share gas focus is continuing to emphasize providing additional value to customers that are willing to recognize that value. So they’re being the non-regulated group of being a little bit more focused on the selection of who they’re serving and so they are high-grading their customer base which has translated at least this year into those better margins that we’re seeing. So we’re going to continue to have that strategy of emphasizing service to customers that are recognizing the additional value they bring to the table in terms of just all of the energy services that are available and then providing the premium product in the form of natural gas that they are getting. But so some folks are willing to pay up right now because of the competitive edge that gas brings to their product and their process.
Brian Russo: Got it okay and then just the it looks like you’ve got about 55% equity ratio, can you talk about maybe the trends you see there, is that kind of a good target trend lower as you raise that financial CapEx?
Bret Eckert: We continue today, we are committed to kind of growing this spending of $900 billion to $1.1 billion through 2018 in a balanced form. The 55% is the product to the equity issuance we did back in February of 2014.
Brian Russo: Okay. And then just lastly the upcoming regulated pipeline, GRC filing I think it is December 2016 any - can you just comment what are the major drivers there and I think we should be aware of that this time?
Bret Eckert: Generally there are no unusual drivers; it is going to be a typical rate case with the focus on cap structure, on return and on service levels and rights. But it won’t be anything unusual.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Bret Eckert: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Bret Eckert: Spencer? He dropped off, lost Spencer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. The variance on O&M which were attributed to the employee incentive plan is that something you just recognize that in the third quarter that is not ongoing, we won’t see that next quarter, is that correct?
Bret Eckert: You recognize an incentive comp base on your initial targets and then with revision of the guidance upwards with only come in higher, on the quarter once you change that is when we catch up on the higher level of expense and so this time we got recorded in the third quarter.
Charles Fishman: Okay, got it. And then the second question was Bret you made the comment that you were experiencing higher consumptions following the heating season, I appreciate if you have add some color to that total whatever you can .
Bret Eckert: Yeah, we have seen, through the nine month period consumption higher than historical norms coming through and so we have always got consumption driven by weather and then you’ll just got a modest consumption consumer will use on a average degree day and we have seen that be higher than historical norms continue into the first nine months of this fiscal year.
Charles Fishman: Whats going on?
Bret Eckert: And it’s hard to highlight exactly what’s driving consumer consumption patterns, but we have seen higher consumption this year.
Kim Cocklin: Charles, I mean that’s kind of national, nationwide circumstance we flipped it some of the tests that are coming out we looked at AGA statistics that recently came out I think last week or two weeks ago and it indicated the better reversal of the trend for declining use of natural gas and for the last two years running there has been an increase in the consumption trend by residential customers. Again, I think, the traction associated with our industry getting out a little bit and promoting the competitiveness in the abundance and the environmental qualities of natural gas.
Charles Fishman: Okay.
Bret Eckert: Certainly in the competitive against other alternative fuel sources.
Charles Fishman: Okay, thank you for that.
Kim Cocklin: The industry and I think you know we are just experiencing because we were, one of the biggest R&D utilities on the planet.
Charles Fishman: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce: Let’s try out this again user error on my part. I apologize.
Kim Cocklin: Okay.
Bret Eckert: Well first mistake of the year for you.
Spencer Joyce: Yes, I got to say so keeping with the Bill Merry movies it is clear that the Cinderella story continues to execute here, nice quarter. Right, what becomes of the broken it is and another one when that comes to mind on if you are not in the stock by the four tops? What in the world applies with what is the sector doing?
Kim Cocklin: It is flattish, it is mostly interest rates on say, we are kind of drawn to tough comp of where lot of the stocks ended last year, but optimistic here is we look towards the back half.
Spencer Joyce: Yes. I guess to be long-term. In any case just want to kind of have question from me, we are inching kind of ever closer here to the endpoint of kind of standing 2018 guidance if you will, but I know we are still a couple of years out but can you talk about any clarity that maybe developing as we look maybe towards the tips of the decade here and potentially when we can see you all maybe roll that target out another year or two?
Bret Eckert: Great question, Spencer we do plan in November when we released earnings of fiscal 2015 to come out and extend that plan to four, five years through 2020, we have launched the plan updated the plan last in 2014 to 2018 we didn’t want to getting practice of rolling out another year, every year. So we kind of do it every two years but we will put out revised plan or updated plan if you will through 2020 we will put guidance out there, guidance range out there in 2020 and as we talked before imagine for 2018 we continue to see the ability to invest at these levels enhancing the safety into the liability for systems. So we expect that in our analyst meeting in November.
Spencer Joyce: Perfect, we will eagerly await that roll out there. Again good quarter and nice year, shaping out to be a good one. That is all I have.
Kim Cocklin: Thanks Spencer. End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Debin. I just want to remind you all recording of the call is available through November 4 and I am here if you have any additional questions. Thank you so much for joining us. Bye, bye.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to our host, Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and our Form 10-Q we filed last night are available on our Web site. To access these materials, please visit our Web site at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we'll take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 20 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on these risks and uncertainties. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO Mr. Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us on the call this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday we did refer to second quarter consolidated net income of about $138 million or $1.35 per diluted share. And for the first six months of our fiscal 2015, reported consolidated net income was about $235 million or $2.31 per diluted share. Our financial results reflect the continued successful execution of our strategy, which we began 3.5 years ago to grow by investing in our regulated assets. Our strategy continues to be very simple, consistent, and transparent. We are on track to invest this year between $900 million to $1 billion of capital into the regulated assets as we strive to become the nation’s safest utility. Our strategy to grow by infrastructure investment was first implemented at the beginning of our fiscal 2012 year. Since then our total return to shareholders through March 31 of 2015 has been 92.7%. The successful execution of our rate and regulatory strategy has continued to enhance the safety of our system and the reliability of our services. Our regulators continue to support and encourage this goal to become the nation’s safest utility by providing us balanced rate treatment and very progressive regulatory policies. The rate impact of the investment on residential customer bills remains very acceptable due to the continued low nature of natural gas prices and the exceptional performance of our gas supply management team. Rate relief for our regulated distribution and pipeline operations combined generated about $41 million of margin in the current quarter, and $73 million of margin for the current six month period. Our liquidity and financial position as Bret will discuss, remains very strong. Our debt capitalization ratio at March 31 was 46.1% and our liquidity remains strong with over $1 billion of capacity available from our facility. Yesterday our Board declared 126th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual rate for fiscal '15 is $1.56. I’m going to turn the call over now to our CFO, Bret Eckert for a more detailed discussion of the results. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. Slide 2 and 3, detail reported net income and income excluding net unrealized margins for the three and six months period of fiscal years 2015 and 2014. As Kim mentioned, reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were $138 million or $1.35 per diluted share compared with $133 million or $1.38 per diluted share one year ago. Excluding unrealized margins, earnings in the current quarter were $1.36 per diluted share versus $1.37 per diluted share last year. On Slide 3, you can see reported earnings were $2.31 per diluted share compared with $2.34 last year. If you eliminate the unrealized gains in both years, earnings per diluted share were $2.27 this year compared to $2.26 one year ago. Increased gross profit from regulatory outcomes and the favorable impact of colder than normal weather, more than offset the effect of weather that was warmer than the prior year and the increased level of pipeline maintenance spending. Slide 4 outlines gross profit and our regulated distribution business. Rate increases lifted distribution gross profit by $26.1 million in the current quarter and $45.4 million for the current six months, reflecting the infrastructure improvements made during the last 12 to 18 months. Additionally, results for the current quarter and current six months benefited from weather that was 15% colder than normal for the quarter and 10% colder than normal for the current six months. However, last year weather was 20% colder than normal in both periods. As a result to the warmer weather versus a year-ago, distributions gross profit was $6 million lower in the growth and $8 million lower for the six months compared to the same period one year ago. Customers in our regulated distribution operation benefited from weather normalization riders, which returned approximately $22 million to customers in the first six months of fiscal 2015 versus $35 million return in fiscal ’14. Slide 5 details gross profit and our regulated intrastate pipeline, APT for the three and six month period. Increases from APT's annual GRIP filings increased rate by $15.3 million in the quarter and $27.8 million for the six months, from the filings approved in 2014 and 2015. Our non-regulated segment is detailed on Slide 14 and 15. Gross profit decreased $14.7 million in the quarter and $17.2 million for the current six months in our non-regulated segment, primarily due to lower realized margins. The decreases in both the current period reflect the absence of gas price volatility experienced last year. In the prior period, strong market demand caused by the extreme cold weather resulted in the acceleration of physical withdraws to capture gross margin. However, realized margins for gas delivery and related services increased by $5.4 million in the quarter and $3.7 million in the current six months. Deliveries of natural gas decreased 12% in the quarter and 8% in the current six months, reflecting the impact of fewer deliveries to power generation customers and other marketers, as a result of the warmer weather during the current period compared to a year-ago. However, in the prior year quarter, we incurred losses to meet peaking requirements to certain customers, which did not recur in the current year. As a result, per unit margins increased in both periods from $0.09 to $0.15 per Mcf in the quarter and from $0.10 to $0.12 per Mcf in the six months period. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. O&M increased by about $9 million in the quarter and $12 million for the year-to-date period, mainly due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance ride away and legal expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense compared to the prior period. As expected, interest charges decreased by about $4 million in the quarter and by about $6.5 million in the current six months, primarily due to replacing the $500 of 10-year debt at an interest of 4.95%, with $500 million of 30-year note at an interest rate of 4.125% in October 2014. Details of our capital spending are presented Slide 6. As you can see CapEx increased about $83 million in the current six-month period compared to one year ago. Close to 80% of our capital expenditures were associated with safety and reliability spending. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2015, as shown on Slide 17, we expect fiscal 2015 earnings per share to be within the previously announced range of $2.90 to $3.05 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins at September 30, 2015. Details on the slide are the expected contributions from a regulated and non-regulated operations as well as selected expenses for the year. None of which has changed since our first fiscal quarter report in early February of this year. We expect a continued execution of our infrastructure and investment strategy coupled with constructive regulations to be the primary drivers for the year’s result. Slide 7 to 13 provides more detail on our rate cases. Our capital budget range has not changed and remains between $900 million and $1 billion for fiscal 2015. Thank you for your time this morning. And now I’ll hand the callback over to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Bret. Very, very good report. As you can see and as you have heard just we have had a very solid quarter and we have an exceptional and solid first half of the fiscal ’15 year. Our regulated rate release continues as the primary driver of our excellent financial results. As of May 6, yesterday, rate outcomes and incremental deferrals have provided annual operating increases of about $59 million so far this fiscal ’15. Rate actions that we have filed and pending, total requested increases of about $39 million and we expect to file another four to five cases by our fiscal year-end that in total would request $20 million, $25 million of additional increases. In late April, we did receive the proposal for decision in the Mid-Tex 2013 rate review mechanism filing. And in that proposal for a decision, the hearing examiner recommended an increase for the Company of approximately $32.7 million, that compares to our request of $33.4 million. We anticipate a final decision which will be made by the Texas Railroad Commission by the end of June or early July. Our Company fundamentals are extremely sound. Our performance is the result of organic growth as we continue to believe and investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use of our capital. We are resolute on that commitment that we made in 2012 and we haven’t wavered from any of our commitments to become the nation's safest utility and the capital investments that we are making to grow rate base by 9% to 10% and earnings per share of 6% to 8% on an annual basis. We very much appreciate your time this morning. And now we will take any questions, comments, or suggestions that you might have. Donna?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi. Good morning.
Bret Eckert: Good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Russo: Just on the guidance, the $2.90 to $3.05, that’s unchanged. But we have seen a lot of gas LBCs report good earnings due to the February cold weather. And I’m just wondering, was that captured in your initial guidance and or why couldn’t we see anymore upside there?
Bret Eckert: Well, you obviously our initial guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 is based on normal weather, but we are reaffirming our earnings to be within that $2.90 to $3.05 range. We did have obviously weather in the prior six-month period and we also had some weather in the current six-month period.
Kim Cocklin: The reaffirmation of the guidance, as Bret said, would incorporate the results from February since they’re in the book and closed [indiscernible].
Brian Russo: Right. Okay, understood. And you mentioned the debt-to-capital I believe at the parent. Could you talk about the debt-to-capital ratio at the regulated pipeline in Texas and the trends you see there?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, we are a consolidated cap structure entity, Brian. So we file on a consolidated cap structure basis. So on an overall cap structure basis; you’re at 54% equity, 46% debt roughly. Now that's -- in certain jurisdictions like Texas, short-term debt excluded. So from that standpoint it should be closer to 57% or so equity, 43% debt when we looked at it from a regulated standpoint, but it varies by jurisdiction.
Brian Russo: Okay. And I may have missed this earlier, but can you just comment on the Texas economy in your service territory and are you seeing any slowdown there?
Kim Cocklin: We as a utility are not seeing any slowdown. We really are -- feel our -- we feel that we are a beneficiary actually at the lower energy prices in Texas. And if you look at the overall economy in Texas, there have been several studies that indicate that there is probably no more than 2% to 4% of the overall economy that's impacted by what's transpired with the reduction in energy prices, but now you're seeing the recent uptick with West Texas coming back over $60. So you'll see in even a ramp up in the activity out in the West. But again, it's been a non-factor for us and our business. We feel like it helped our customers and has reduced what they are paying at the pump for gas and given them a little bit more discretionary income. Natural gas prices obviously help our visitors significantly and continue to provide us the room that is necessary to invest this capital and reflect it in the rate on a very quick basis than in Texas where the regulators have been very, very balanced and fair relative to the investment and the lag associated with that.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.
Charles Fishman: Good morning. Just one question. Slide 14, third line down, other, the $16.8 million negative variance year-over-year. And I see the comments on the right there, but can you explain the volatility driving that line? Is that from trading, from customers utilizing your storage more, what drives that line?
Kim Cocklin: It’s really just timing within the asset optimization line. We are still projecting that the non-regulated business will meet the provided -- previously announced guidance range of $10 million to $12 million. So you know it’s just the timing of when the realized positions come through.
Charles Fishman: Okay. So the volatility allows you to optimize purchases and sales and you are able to take advantage of that. That’s what’s going on in that line?
Kim Cocklin: Yes and that’s driven by timing as well. Timing of when positions close within a quarter versus within the fiscal year.
Charles Fishman: Okay. Thank you. That was it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Spencer Joyce of Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the good quarter we got this morning.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you. Thanks for your shout out again, Spencer. It wouldn't be a call without you coming in.
Spencer Joyce: Yes. That’s [indiscernible].
Kim Cocklin: How about that Derby winner too now?
Spencer Joyce: Yes, he's favored to keep winning a contrarian like me is going to go broke.
Kim Cocklin: Well, it’s just like the Atmos stock; the favors just keep showing up. The fundamentals keep performing.
Spencer Joyce: Yes. Yes, just one quick one here for me. I believe, Bret, you touched on weather a little bit and I tried to jot some notes down here. But I know we entered fiscal ’15 knowing we would have a bit of a headwind assuming normal weather. And if I heard you correctly, the weather versus an average, if you will, was favorable over the first half of the fiscal year here, but we may still anticipate a slight headwind in -- excuse me, first half ’16 versus maybe first half ’15?
Bret Eckert: Yes, I thought you would ask that question, Spencer. If you look at this, we announced last year, and last year’s results we had about $0.17 of weather. And about $0.12 of that came on the non-regulated side, with about nickel in the regulated side. Obviously, we budget normal weather. We have again seen -- a lot of the numbers you looked in the release, you're comparing quarter-to-quarter and six months -- to six months and skew it when you compare it against normal. But if you look at it overall, probably on a year-to-date basis, last year at this point we probably had about $0.10 a weather. You probably have $0.04 to $0.06 a weather in the six-month period of 2015.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, perfect. Yes, that’s almost exactly what I was kind of basing on, but in any case, good quarter. That’s all I had. You folks travel safe.
Bret Eckert: Well, you too.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Spencer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  End of Q&A Ms. Giles, at this time I’d like to turn the floor back over to you for any additional or closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Donna. Just to remind you all that a recording of this call is available for replay on our Web site through August 5, and we look forward to visiting with many of you at the AGA Financial Forum later this month. We appreciate your interest in Atmos and thank you for joining us this morning. Goodbye.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Spencer Joyce - Hilliard Lyons Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations for Atmos Energy. Thank you. Please begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we'll take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. Additionally the company’s Form 10-Q was filed last night and is also available on our website. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 17 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning to everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy and congratulations to anybody that is a New England Patriots fan. Next year is the Cowboys year again. Yesterday we did report first quarter consolidated net income of $98 million or $0.96 per diluted share and after excluding the unrealized margins, net income was $93 million or $0.91 per diluted share. The regulated operations drove substantially all of our quarter-over-quarter growth. These operations are driven by very focused rate and regulatory strategy, which render stable and predictable earnings. The rate relief for our regulated distribution and pipeline operations combined generated about $32 million of incremental margin in our first quarter of fiscal '15.  Our liquidity and financial position remained very strong. In October you will recall we issued $500 million of senior notes at a rate of 4.125%, replacing $500 million of senior notes with a rate of 4.95%, and our debt-to-capital ratio was 49.5% at December 31 compared with 54.2% one year ago. Yesterday at our board meeting our board of directors declared our 125th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '15 is $1.56, and then last month we announced the appointment of Mike Haefner as Executive Vice President. This allows us the opportunity to strengthen the bench within the organization as Mike will become more involved in managing the operations of the company and the appointment also affords me the luxury and time to focus on building shareholder value, devoting more time to existing and potential investors and to continue to promote the exceptional value proposition of Atmos Energy. Our CFO, Bret Eckert, is going to now review our financial results in greater detail. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. If you follow me on Slide 2, as Kim mentioned reported net income for the quarter was $98 million or $0.96 per diluted share compared with $87 million or $0.95 one year ago. After excluding unrealized margins in both periods net income was $93 million or $0.91 per diluted share, compared with $81 million or $0.88 per share last year. We experienced business as usual in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. With return to more normal weather conditions during the quarter, spending levels for maintenance and capital activities were more in line with expectation compared to last year. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of enhancing the safety and the reliability of our infrastructure coupled with constructive regulation across our service areas. Turning now to Slide 3 quarter-over-quarter gross profit in our regulated distribution segment increased by about $25 million. $19 million of the increase is the result of rate outcomes received during fiscal 2014 primarily in Texas and Kentucky. We also experienced a 13% increase in transportation volumes in the current quarter versus last year’s quarter primarily due to increased economic activity in our West Texas and Kentucky/Mid-States division, which added about $2 million of incremental gross profit. Service fee revenues were up quarter-over-quarter by about $2 million and was largely driven by increased customer reconnection activities following our fiscal 2014 customer collection efforts. These increases were partially offset by lower margins resulting to a return to more normal weather conditions during the quarter. Weather during the current quarter was slightly colder than normal and was 14% warmer than the prior year quarter. Therefore, although we experienced a 12% decrease in sales volume gross profit declined by just $2 million or less than 1%. This demonstrates how our weather normalization mechanisms insulate both the company and our customers during periods of atypical weather. Turning to Slide 4, our regulated pipeline generated over $12 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter primarily as the result of $12.5 million increase in rates from the approved 2014 GRIP filings. APT experienced an increase in third-party transportation volumes, transportation rates and pipeline demand fees and that generated about $3 million of additional revenue. However, these increases were partially offset by declines in other third-party ancillary services of blending, [Indiscernible] treating and storage of about $1 million, and as a reminder the prior year quarter included a non-recurring $2 million benefit associated with the renewal of APT's annual adjustment mechanism. Turning now to our non-regulated segment and you may want to turn to Slide 12. Gross profit decreased about $2.5 million in our non-regulated segment due to a decrease in unrealized margins quarter-over-quarter. Realized margins for gas delivery and related services decreased $1.7 million, marginally due to a decrease in gas delivery per unit margins to $0.10 per MCF from $0.12 a year ago, and a 2% decrease in consolidated sales volumes. The decrease in both per unit margins and consolidated sales volumes reflects the impact of warmer weather during the current quarter compared to last year’s quarter. Additionally, increased transportation cost adversely impacted per unit margins. offsetting the decrease in delivered gas margins was a $2.2 million increase in other realized margins, primarily due to a reduction in third-party storage fees and the timing and magnitude of settled financial positions quarter-over-quarter. Turning briefly to the expense side of the income statement. O&M increased by almost $3 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to higher labor and benefits expense and increased pipeline maintenance spending. Offsetting these increases was a reductions in legal expenses. As expected interest expense decreased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter due to the replacing of the $500 million of ten-year debt at an interest rate of 4.95% with $500 million of 30-year debt at an interest rate of 4.125%. Details about our capital spending are presented on Slide 5. As you can see CapEx increased almost $81 million in the first quarter compared to one year ago. Spending in our regulated pipeline segment increased by almost $42 million due to the enhancement and fortification of the Bethel and TriCities storage field. We are drilling horizontal wells to improve the storage capabilities of the TriCities facility and installing pipelines to connect the [Indiscernible] Salt Dome Bethel storage to TriCities to better utilize the combined compression capabilities of the storage facilities and to better meet peak day requirements at the Mid-Tex and other LDC customers. Spending in the regulated distribution segment increased to almost $39 million primarily due to our continued focus on the safety and reliability of our system. You may recall our construction crews were sidelined for a portion of December 2013 due to the wintry weather, which also contributed to the increase in spending in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 and you may want to turn to Slide 14. We expect fiscal 2015 earnings per share to be in the previously announced range of $2.90 to $3.05 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins at September 30, 2015. Details on this slide are the expected contributions from our regulated and non-regulated operations, as well as selective expenses for the year none of which has changed since our year-end earnings call in early November. We expect the continued execution of our infrastructure investment strategy coupled with constructive regulation to be the primary driver for this year’s results. Looking on Slide 24, we anticipate annual operating income increases of $105 million to $125 million from approved rate outcomes in the year. Looking now on Slide 15, our capital budget range has not changed and remains between $900 million and $1 billion for fiscal 2015. Thank you for your time and now, I'll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Bret. Exceptional report and solid earnings report for the fiscal first quarter of ’15. Regulated rate relief does remain the primary driver of our financial performance and through the first quarter of ’15 rate outcomes and incremental deferrals have provided annual operating increases of about $6 million. Additionally yesterday we settled the Mississippi stable rate filing, which will provide an increase in annual operating income of $4.4 million. Other rate actions year-to-date that are filed and pending total about $18 million of annual operating increases and the more significant filings include the Tennessee rate case seeking an increase of about $6 million, the rate review mechanism for the West Texas cities seeking an increase of about $5 million and the Mid-Tex rate review mechanism for the city of Dallas, which is requesting about $7 million. We do expect an additional 10 to 12 filings in fiscal '15 requesting between $80 million and $90 million of additional increases to operating income and you can see those details on slides 7 through 11 in the deck that was provided. Our earnings are straightforward with the business model of delivering safe and reliable natural gas in the States we serve are companies totally domestic with no direct exposure to risk associated with foreign currency or unstable economies. Outside the United States, Atmos Energy and our regulated distribution customers are significant beneficiaries of the following energy prices. We are able to pass through these lower natural gas prices to our customers and this has provided us the continued opportunity to proactively upgrade our system as we strive to be the safest gas utility in the nation, while keeping customers’ bills affordable. And assuming normal weather and pricing conditions we do expect through at least fiscal 2018 that our customer bills will be flat to lower than the average bill that they have incurred for most of the last 10 years. As a result our customers will be able to affordably benefit from a much safer and more reliable system as we continue to invest, and as Bret said these quarter results really are a result of business as usual for us. Our earnings report should come as no surprise as we have continuously communicated our growth through investment – in infrastructure investment. We remain dedicated to this strategy and remain focused on spending between $900 million to $1.1 billion of capital annually through fiscal 2018 to enhance the safety and reliability of our system. The enhanced value of the rate base is expected to generate earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% through fiscal 2018.  We thank you very much for your time and now we will open up the call for your questions. Melissa?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Russo: Hi, good morning.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning.
Brian Russo: Just noticed the debt-to-cap ratio now at 49.5% up from 46%, and I noticed the short-term debt balance up meaningfully at $550 million, just kind of curious when you might term that out or kind of where you see the debt-to-cap ratio kind of play out towards the end of 2015?
Bret Eckert: Brian this is Bret Eckert, the debt-to-cap ratio that you saw move obviously is through the growth of the short-term [debt balance]. We use that to fund seasonal gas purchases, but you are always going to see it spike when you get to the end of our first fiscal quarter and then those balances tend to come down as you come out of the spring and into the summer. So last year at the same time there was about $690 million of short-term debt outstanding and so it is lower than last year, but it really is just the ebb and flow of gas purchases.
Brian Russo: Okay, got it and with the first quarter now behind you are – any sense of where you might fall within that $105 million to $125 million rate revenue range that you are forecasting for ’15?
Bret Eckert: No, we – we still remain confident we’re going to fall within the $105 million to $125 million range based on what we have seen so far this year.
Brian Russo: Okay, and then just with the decline in oil and expected impacts to the Texas economy can you just talk about any impact if at all to your Texas based regulated operations?
Kim Cocklin: Brian this is Kim, there is really as we have said our significant beneficiary of the falling oil prices are all of our customers and consequently it gives them much more discretionary income as their utility bills continues to fall and it has an immediate benefit primarily to our the uncollectibles or the [Indiscernible] account balance as well is reduced as a result of the reduced oil price or gas prices and oil prices. So – 
Brian Russo: No, I noticed an increase in transportation revenues, is that tied to kind of the energy industry or is that separate from that?
Kim Cocklin: It is separate from that, I mean, we have, traditional customers commercial and industrial customers and we are picking up additional loads as some of the economies continue to come back that we have been serving primarily because of the reduction in oil and gas prices as part of their process for their manufacture of the products that they are manufacturing.
Brian Russo: Okay understood, and then lastly if you annualize your first quarter ’15 O&M it is tracking below 495 million to 515 million assumption in your guidance, I’m just curious is there any kind of seasonality around that O&M, where would be higher in subsequent quarters?
Kim Cocklin: Well, you always have the weather to contend with in our first fiscal quarter Brian, and so we still feel confident in the 495 million to 515 million O&M range that we have put out, but you will see if you look back at the first quarter last year O&M was clearly lower, but we had such wintry weather at the time that it was difficult to get out and get things completed. So, I think you still will find us falling in the range disclosed.
Brian Russo: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.
Spencer Joyce: Good morning folks. Great quarter.
Kim Cocklin: Hi, Spencer, thank you. Thank you very much.
Spencer Joyce: One question here kind of in the [Indiscernible] have you all noted the potential size of this year’s GRIP filing for the pipeline segments?
Bret Eckert: Well, Spencer, the teams obviously are in the process of putting that filing together, but it is going to fall within the range that is driving the 105 million to 125 million of annual increases that we disclosed.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, great, great. Fair enough, and from a filing standpoint we are still looking at a filing on that this month sometime?
Bret Eckert: That is correct.
Spencer Joyce: Okay. finally and you all have sort of have touched on this a little bit throughout the call, can you just spend a little bit more time explaining to us the impact to you all of the low gas prices, I know it is pretty easy on the retail side to understand the falling customer bills and the ability for you all to perhaps do some extra infrastructure on the retail side, but particularly on the pipeline segment is there a risk that perhaps some contraction on the industrial growth could either hamper growth or perhaps even drive a decline there, just hoping to get a little better handle on what the falling energy prices could do there?
Kim Cocklin: No, they will not impact the pipeline operations or the expected assumptions we have around the margins and the income associated with that. Primarily, we have fixed contracts on sort of a pretty good term and they are designed on the straight fixed variable basis so they are not tied to throughput. We are not experiencing any reduction in throughput on the pipeline system either, I mean, we are continuing to see although they are laying down rigs in many of the production areas, they are going back in on the wells that they’re currently producing and doing some secondary and territory recovery. Mechanisms to continue to increase the production, so we looked at that and we see no threat to the pipeline operations through what we consider the near and the midterm for sure.
Spencer Joyce: Okay, fantastic. That's all I had, nice quarter.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Spencer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou with Avon Capital Advisors, please proceed with your question.
Andy Levi: Hi, it's Andy Levi, how are you?
Kim Cocklin: Hi, Andy, how are you?
Andy Levi: I am alright. Just a few questions. Just on bonus depreciation and also on pension/discount rates, I guess, since your Analyst Day and since you gave guidance, the year ended in bonus appreciation was extended. So, I was just wondering if that has any effect on the numbers that you had given us and then also as far as pensions and mortality rates and things like that whether that has any change there?
Kim Cocklin: No. No, on both counts Andy, both the bonus appreciation where we thought that was coming out, it doesn’t really impact the income statement more of a cash flow item and from the discount rates there, we are in-line with what we expected coming into the year.
Andy Levi: Okay and just remind us pension wise kind of where you are as far as what percentage is funded?
Kim Cocklin: It's over 90% on a pre-map 21 basis and map 21 basis higher than that. I don't have the exact percentages, I think Susan, we could look at that but its north of 90%.
Andy Levi: Okay, thank you. And then, one last question. Just a little bit of that happening on the electric side, it’s happened on the gas side already but just your thoughts on, I guess, in Texas it probably won't make any sense, but in some of your other jurisdictions on rate basing, net gas prices are low right now?
Kim Cocklin: You are talking about like regulated production?
Andy Levi: Yes.
Kim Cocklin: Yes, [indiscernible] we are not, no I mean, there is no need to do that with where gas prices are currently and certainly where they’re anticipated to be if you look at any of the forecast from the EIA or any other forecasting services that are reputable and reliable. They have through the next 10 years, gas prices in the $4 to $6 range and I think, I was looking, yesterday our [indiscernible] dropped from last year to this year of about $0.70. We were at $4.40 I think last year and this year we have [indiscernible] of about 370 and that's all driven as a result of the 50% market purchases that we make annually to fulfill those requirements. So, if you set that up, you got to assume production of the field and then you got to assume an ROE and by the time a lot of that stuff puts you out of the market or above market prices which I don't think it's a – it's not a good – it's not anything that we would consider doing right now. Our highest and best uses to put the dollars we have in our infrastructure and we have a significant amount of infrastructure that we can invest in for a long period of time and as long as we are able to have the balanced regulation and all of the jurisdictions where we are situated and achieve the returns and continue to reduce the regulatory lag and continue to improve the recovery of the fixed cost in a customer charge that's our strategy. But, we want to put it, I mean, the production side doesn’t help us with our continued desire and highest priority to become the safest utility in the country either.
Andy Levi: Got it and one last question. I don’t know if you can quantify this, but just price of gasoline has clearly dropped, you guys have a lot of trucks, I am just curious if the prices were to stay kind of where they are what the angle benefit could be?
Kim Cocklin: Our trucks run on natural gas. We don't have anything on [just getting] no, I don't know.
Bret Eckert: Hi Andy, we don’t think if that had the impact. On moving items, I think we will still be in that same [indiscernible]
Kim Cocklin: We’ve got a system which dispatches those trucks very efficiently and effectively so that we minimize the mileage that they travel every day. But that's not a needle move or either.
Andy Levi: Right, thank you very much.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ms. Giles, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.
Susan Giles: Well, thank you Melisa and I just want to remind all of you that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through May 6. We appreciate your interest in Atmos and thank you for joining us.

===== 2014 Q4  (2014-11-06 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim R. Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret J. Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2014 Year End Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Giles. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Jenna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Our speakers are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we'll take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. Also, we expect to file our Form 10-K later today. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 27 for more information regarding risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning to everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, as you know, we were pleased to report earnings of $2.96 per diluted share for fiscal '14. These results reflect the third year since we initiated our growth strategy to invest in our regulated assets as we strive to be the nation's safest utility. Our success was attributable again to the exceptional dedication and outstanding performance of all of our employees, who met the challenges presented by the unusually cold weather to ensure safe, reliable and competitively priced customer service. Additionally, these operational and financial results are impacted significantly by the important relationships that we have with our regulators, agency staff, city officials and customers, who understand the critical importance of making safety the top priority. Our regulated operations continued to contribute stable and predictable earnings driven by a very focused rates and regulatory strategy. Rate relief for our regulated distribution and pipeline operations combined generated about $74 million of incremental margin in fiscal '14. Our nonregulated operations took advantage of the volatility in the natural gas markets that occurred earlier in the year. Although the delivered gas business remains its core focus, our marketing group was able to seize opportunities associated with weather and generated incremental gross profit by accelerating physical withdrawals in a very volatile natural gas price environment. Our liquidity, financial position and balance sheet remain very strong. During fiscal '14 and early fiscal '15, we carried out several initiatives to enhance our financial profile. In mid-February, you'll recall, we strengthened our equity ratio with the sale of 9.2 million shares of common stock, our first public offering since 2006. Equally impressive was the fact that we absorbed the dilution from these additional shares as a result of the colder-than-normal weather and constructive rate outcomes. Our revolving $950 million credit facility was increased to $1.25 billion with the term extended through August 2019. This increase, coupled with the accordion feature, expands our borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion. We also replaced $500 million of long-term debt, which carried an interest rate of 4.95%, with $500 million of 30-year unsecured notes carrying an interest rate of 4.125%, reducing our interest expense by $8 million per year. Our debt-to-capital ratio at year-end '14, September 30, '14, was 46.2% and our liquidity remains strong with over $1 billion of capacity available from our short-term facilities. Last, but not least, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our dividend for the 31st consecutive year. The fiscal 2015 indicated rate is now $1.56, an increase of $0.08 per share or 5.4%. The dividend hike sustains last year's increase and delivers a commitment that we identified at that time. We will continue our philosophy of providing sustained annual increases and believe the increase in the dividend reflects our goal to provide both an attractive return while executing on our growth strategy. Our strategy to grow by infrastructure investment was first implemented in fiscal 2010 -- 2012. Since then, for the fiscal 3-year period, our total return to shareholders has been 63.8%. We haven't swayed from this plan. These capital investments continue to improve the safety and reliability of our utilities. And when the colder-than-normal weather occurred, our systems' operational performance was exceptional. Fiscal 2014 was a remarkable year and the financial performance followed suit as Bret Eckert, our CFO will now discuss. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Our remarks will primarily focus on the full year results. If you follow me on Slide 3, reported earnings were $290 million or $2.96 per diluted share this year compared with $243 million or $2.64 per share last year. After excluding the net unrealized margins in both periods and the prior year gain on the sale of our Georgia operations, earnings were $284 million or $2.90 per diluted share in fiscal '14 compared with $233 million or $2.53 per share last year. Consolidated results for the year were favorably impacted by weather that was 20% colder than normal, which drove higher throughput across all of our segments and created natural gas price volatility for our nonregulated segment. Customers in our regulated distribution operations benefited from weather normalization riders, which returned approximately $35 million to customers in fiscal '14. After giving consideration to this adjustment and adjusting for other weather-driven operating expenses, the impact of colder-than-normal weather contributed $17.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2014. Slide 5 outlines gross profit in our regulated distribution business and Slide 6 details gross profit for our regulated pipeline segment for the 3- and 12-month period. The execution of our regulatory strategy continues to drive our financial performance. Rate increases had a positive effect during the year, lifting distribution gross profit by $35.3 million and regulated pipeline gross profit by another $38.5 million. For the year, we implemented $134 million in operating income increases on an annual basis. Slides 8 through 16 provide more details on our rate filings for fiscal 2014. As I previously mentioned, fiscal 2014 was benefited from colder-than-normal weather. Increased customer consumption in our LDCs and higher throughput in related margins at APT contributed about $19 million of the gross profit increase this year. Slide 17 provides the details for our nonregulated segment. Gross profit in our nonregulated operations increased $24.6 million in fiscal 2014. Although the delivered gas business remains AEM's core focus, AEM was opportunistic during the significantly colder weather earlier the year by accelerating physical withdrawals into the second quarter from the future periods to capture gross profit during the volatile natural gas price environment that was associated with the colder weather. We don't anticipate this will be repeated in fiscal 2015 as nonregulated earnings are expected to return to normal levels driven by its core delivered gas business in fiscal 2015. Shifting now to the income -- the expense side of the income statement. The rise in O&M expenses for the year was primarily due to increased levels of pipeline maintenance activities; employee wage increases and higher weather-related costs, including higher variable incentive compensation expense, increased standby and overtime cost during the cold months and higher bad debt expense as a result of higher customer bills during the much colder winter. These increases were partially offset by lower legal and administrative expenses due to the resolution of 2 legal matters in the nonregulated segment during 2014. Fourth quarter O&M expense was down $10 million, primarily from the timing of variable incentive compensation that was recorded in the second quarter in the current year compared to the fourth quarter last year. Capital expenditures were $835 million for the year compared with $845 million last year. The decrease primarily reflects the $64 million decrease in capital in our regulated pipeline segment that was associated with the completion of Line WX expansion project, partially offset by a $55 million increase in capital spending in our regulated distribution segment due to increased spending under our infrastructure replacement programs. Over 75% of 2014 CapEx was invested to enhance the safety and the reliability of our systems, and approximately 91% of 2014 capital expenditures was incurred under mechanisms that reduced lag to 6 months or less. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2015. We have announced our fiscal 2015 earnings per share guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margin. Slides 21 and 22 detail our net income and expense projections for fiscal 2015. As I previously stated, the impact of colder-than-normal weather contributed $17.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share in fiscal '14. After excluding the impact of colder-than-normal weather, 2014 weather adjusted net income was $267 million or $2.73 per diluted share as shown on Slide 21. The midpoint of fiscal 2015 guidance would represent an 8.8% earnings per share growth rate from the weather adjusted 2014 earnings of $2.73, excluding unrealized margins. All of our growth in fiscal '15 is expected to be driven by our regulated operation as nonregulated earnings are expected to return to normal level driven by its core delivery gas business. We project regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $285 million to $300 million. We continue to expect constructive rate outcomes to be the primary driver of next year's results and anticipate annual operating income increases of between $105 million and $125 million from implemented rate outcomes in fiscal '15. Our nonregulated business is expected to generate net income in the $10 million to $12 million range, with an assumption of non-regulated delivered gas volumes of between 390 and 410 Bcf at a per unit margin of $0.10 to $0.11. Consolidated net income for fiscal 2015 is expected to range from $295 million to $312 million and average diluted shares are expected to range from 102 million to 104 million shares. O&M expense is projected to range between $495 million and $515 million. We're assuming a return to normal weather with variable compensation, overtime and standby pay and bad debt expense reverting to more normal levels. However, we do expect normal employee-based compensation increases, along with employee benefits inflation, primarily medical and dental costs. Depreciation and amortization is expected to range between $265 million and $285 million due to increased capital investment in fiscal 2014. Interest expense is expected to decrease for fiscal '14 due to the replacement of the $500 million 4.95% senior notes with $500 million 4 1/8% senior notes in October 15 of this year. Income tax expense is expected to decrease and range between $175 million and $185 million. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the 37% to 38% range. Our capital budget is expected to range between $900 million and $1 billion in fiscal 2015 and will allow us to further enhance and upgrade our natural gas delivery system. We continue our focus on strategic infrastructure spend by utilizing rate mechanisms and timely rate filings. About 91% of our 2015 CapEx will begin earning a return within 6 months of test year end. Thank you for your time. And now, I'll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Bret. Exceptional report. We do continue to have an exceptional portfolio of assets, and this year, we did increase earnings for the 12th consecutive year. And we will continue to emphasize the sustainability and reliability of meeting our commitments to the shareholder or earnings per share growth and total shareholder return. We are achieving desired regulatory outcomes in most jurisdictions where we operate. Most recently, the rate stabilization clause in Louisiana was modified to include an infrastructure mechanism that authorizes deferral treatment very similar to Rule 8209 that exists in Texas. Going forward, we would expect to increase capital expenditures in Louisiana as a result of this change. In Kansas, the regulatory environment continues to be challenging. We, along with other utilities that operate there, are pursuing all remedies to enhance the opportunity for more reasonable rate outcomes. Our latest rate filing resulted in a 9.1% return on equity component in Kansas. We will continue to strengthen our relationships in Kansas with the regulators and the customers and maintain our steadfast desire to be the safest provider of natural gas utility services. In fiscal '15, we're projecting between $105 million and $125 million in operating income increases on an annual basis from rate outcomes. Lastly, our $33 million Mid-Tex Rate Review Mechanism filing is still pending before the Railroad Commission. We did begin collecting these rates June 1 subject to refund. That -- the issue in that case is whether the filing conforms to the terms of the rate review mechanism tariff that was established with our city customers in Texas. We're hopeful for a decision to be rendered by calendar year end. We're continuing to take our commitments to the shareholder's in TheStreet very seriously. Our $900 million to $1 billion of annual capital investment remains focused on enhancing the safety and reliability of our infrastructure, investing in our own system assets versus taking on an acquisition to grow the business. Our story is very simple. In fact, we are one of the just -- one of the few in the utility space with the level of confidence to put out a long-range plan. In fiscal '18, we're projecting $3.50 to $3.75 of earnings per share. And although we've narrowed the P/E gap, our multiple is still below the average of our peers. We continue to project 9% to 10% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% annual earnings growth through fiscal '18. Coupled with the dividend yield, total annual return is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range through fiscal '18. We've had another solid year, and we remain committed to delivering dependable, consistent and long-term shareholder value. We do appreciate your time this morning, and we're ready to take any questions you have. Jenna?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JP Morgan.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to touch on your increased CapEx guidance. You briefly mentioned it. And obviously, part of it's going to be due to the Louisiana rider that was just implemented there. But could give you us a little bit more granularity on both the 2015 outlook and then beyond that as well?
Bret J. Eckert: Yes. We do plan to get into a bit more granularity on the CapEx at our Analyst Conference on the 19th, Chris. But you really hit it. You see increased capital spending -- continue to increase capital spending in connection with our deferral mechanisms in Texas with the new infrastructure wording that's part of the rate stabilization clause in Louisiana. You'll see increased capital spending in that jurisdiction as well. You also going to have a bit of an increase in capital spending at the pipeline this year. And those are the main drivers of the increase year-over-year.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then you don’t anticipate any incremental financing needs outside of your current plan in terms of equity?
Bret J. Eckert: No, we'll roll out an update of our financing plan through 2018 on the 19th. We just -- as we talked about, replaced the expiring tranche of $500 million senior notes that came due on the 15th of October this year. We did not upsize that facility, we announced that it will not grow, and we're able to tighten the pricing into a lower interest cost. And with -- we have about $197 million in short-term debt outstanding with about $1.2 billion of liquidity at September 30. So our plans, as we've previously presented them, have not changed from that.
Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just I would love to hear your thoughts on some of the changes at the Texas Railroad Commission. Recently, you had a relatively new chairperson that has been seated, and then I guess the elections the other day resulted in the appointment of a new commissioner as well. Were there any kind of major surprises there? Is there anything we should be thinking about for the long-term of your regulatory relationships there?
Kim R. Cocklin: No. Chris, this is Kim. That's a good question. The election results were -- they came out as we expected. There's a new commissioner, Ryan Sitton, who is -- has an engineering-based energy firm, consulting firm in Houston, Texas with about 300 plus employees. He has -- we have visited with him. He's visited our training center here. He's very familiar with the industry. He will continue to strike a very appropriate balance between the needs of us to continue invest in our infrastructure to be the safest utility in the country against the interest of the consumer. Christi Craddick will be appointed the chairperson and she will continue to do a very good job, along with Commissioner Porter. So no, I mean, the Texas economy continues to be significantly pushed along by the energy, and in particular, natural gas. So we continue to see them as probably leading the country in terms of proactive and visionary regulation for motivating investment while the shale gas prices continue to provide that opportunity. Louisiana following suit. I mean -- we're just -- we're very, very happy to be in the jurisdictions where we're situated. And Texas obviously leads the charge. And the rest of the elections, I think you're going to support that as well, from the governor and the lieutenant governor. I mean, it's going to continue to be a very pro-business, healthy economy driven situation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: I want to dive in here. Just a couple of nuance questions. Maybe, perhaps, Bret, you on the guidance side. What's kind of the weighted average cost on the commercial paper program? Is that right around 1%?
Bret J. Eckert: No. I mean, you're getting commercial paper somewhere in the 25 to 30 basis point range right now.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Okay. Got you. And then on the O&M side. Looks like the midpoint of guidance is roughly flattish from this year. And I know we'll have some upside probably from hiring and health care cost and normal inflationary type pressures. But I guess my question is, what's the offset or the give-back that we'll see next year that was perhaps driven by the weather in fiscal '14 and just, in general, increased activity there?
Bret J. Eckert: Yes, it really, it goes back. We did with the cold, cold weather, we had that overtime and standby cost that you wouldn't expect to repeat as we made sure that we maintained our service level. When you have those higher customer bills, when the weather surprises folks, bad debt expenses was higher, and we do expect that to return to normal levels. And of course, fiscal '15, we're budgeting that we would achieve target from a variable incentive compensation standpoint. And so what weather had done, really drove variable incentive comp higher. And we'd expect that to be removed. Those really are the main drivers of it with the few offsets that you had mentioned.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Okay. So I guess, the sort of inordinary upside in '14 may have been $15-ish million or so?
Bret J. Eckert: I think if you look year-over-year, it's up about $17 million, if you look actual '14 versus actual '13.
Kim R. Cocklin: Are you talking about weather? What's he...
Bret J. Eckert: Are you talking about the O&M impact of those? Yes, as far as the O&M impact from those items that were incremental, that's -- you're in the range.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Okay, great, great. And then, Kim, maybe from a broader standpoint. The first caller touched on it a little bit. But it really has been a great few years for the ATO stakeholders here, and I was just wondering if perhaps, even anecdotally, if you'd seen any kind of populist uprisings? Or any kind of unrest maybe among either politicians or regulators, that says, "Hey, how is the utility performing so well there?" Or maybe contrary to that, are we really in sort of the same sweet spot that maybe we were in a few years ago? Kind of, off which we've seen this growth?
Kim R. Cocklin: No. There's been no uprising. And our story and justification for the performance is really driven by our desire to be the safest utility. And the $900 million of $1 billion that we're putting in our assets is not really stuff that we're dreaming up or that we're -- it's really driven by the regulations that are coming out at the federal level, and more importantly, at the state level. And the regulators, I mean our regulators, we're taking every opportunity that we have. And because of the way we're organized, we have business units with -- populated with presidents and officers who have responsibility and accountably out there that are very close to the regulators and the agencies themselves. And they take every opportunity to visit with those folks and make sure that they understand. So our customers, we meet with them very frequently, and they understand what we're spending from a capital standpoint, from an O&M standpoint, what's driving it. And if you look at the management of our gas supply side of our business, we actually -- because of our hedging strategies and the storage capabilities, I mean, our weighted average cost for the upcoming winter is expected to be a little bit lower than what we experienced actually this year. So we continue to be able to make this investment, which really is necessary. And a lot of it's compliance-driven. We're not a compliance-driven operation, we certainly are going to do all we can to exceed the compliance standards that are out there, to be the safest person and utility in the United States. But the gas prices continue to provide us the opportunity to reflect these bite-size increases. And the results that you're seeing operationally and from a safety standpoint can't be denied. So we're utilizing all that as a good story to discuss with anybody that ask, "Why are you having such a great run financially?" But you got to look at the operational side of the business which is really driving that. And it's going to continue. We've got an extensive line of appetite to continue to address all of the infrastructure that we have plans to do. So we don't see any end to the investment in our infrastructure. And we don't certainly see any -- we're not expecting to ever back away or not meet the commitments that we've made to TheStreet to grow the rate base at the level we're talking about and the earnings at the 6% to 8% level. And then where we're at with the dividend, very comfortable payout ratio of 52.5%. We still got some running room on that if we need it.
Operator: There are no other questions in the question queue. I'd like to turn the program over back to Ms. Giles. Go ahead, please.
Susan Giles: Thanks, Jenna. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February 3. I am here all day if anyone has specific questions. Other than that, we appreciate your interest, and thank you for joining.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-08-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim R. Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret J. Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy third quarter earnings results call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Atmos Energy. Thank you. You may begin.
Susan Giles: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and our 10-Q, as filed last night, are available on our website at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we will take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 22 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're all having a good day. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.45 per diluted share compared to $0.42 per share 1 year ago. We continue to hit on all cylinders this quarter and took full advantage of the improved weather this quarter to remain on time and on budget with our planned capital projects. Our solid results from the third quarter, coupled with record earnings for the first 6 months, generated year-to-date reported earnings per diluted share of $2.76, up from $2.57 for the prior 9-month period, despite the absence of the financial contribution from the Georgia assets that were sold last April 1 and the issuance of 9.2 million additional shares in our February offering. Our strategy to grow by investing in the safety and reliability of our regulated infrastructure, which we began in fiscal 2012, has generated exceptional operational and financial results. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to execute on our capital plan by spending between $850 million and $950 million annually to fortify our system, while growing regulated rate base by 9% to 10% each year, and improve rate designs with more fixed cost recovered in customer base charges that provided the stability, predictability and reliability of our revenue. Also, the rate design changes at Mid-Tex last year have resulted in a much more ratable distribution in margin spread throughout the year. Our debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 was 44%, with no short-term debt outstanding. And our liquidity remained very strong with over $1 billion of available capacity from our short-term credit facilities. We remain steadfastly committed to increasing shareholder value. As a result, our Board of Directors declared our 123rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '14 was $1.48, representing a 5.7% increase over the '13 annual dividend rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Bret Eckert. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thank you, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 give you a comparison for both reported net income and net income, excluding unrealized margin for the 3- and 9-month periods of 2014 and 2013. Earnings per diluted share for the current 3 months were $0.45 compared with $0.42 last year when you exclude unrealized margins and the gain on the Georgia sale from prior year results. For the current 9 months, earnings per diluted share increased 12% year-over-year to $2.69 compared to $2.40 last year. Consolidated results for the current 9 month were favorably impacted by weather that was 20% colder than last year, which drove higher throughput across all segments of our business and created natural gas price volatility. This drove consolidated year-to-date gross profit higher by about $43 million in the current 9 months. Slide 4 outlines gross profit in our regulated distribution business, and Slide 5 details gross profit for our regulated intrastate pipeline, APT, for the 3- and 9-month periods. Increased customer consumption in our LDC and higher throughput in related margins at APT contributed about $18 million of this increase year-to-date. Rate increases also had a positive effect during the year, lifting distribution gross profit by $9.2 million in the quarter and $24.5 million for the current 9 months. In addition, increases from APT's annual GRIP filing increased rates by $12.2 million in the quarter and $26.3 million for the 9 months. As previously discussed, we anticipate annual operating income increases of between $110 million and $130 million from approved rate outcomes in fiscal '14. As of August 4, about $128 million in operating income increases on an annual basis have been implemented, and rate actions filed and pending total about $18 million. Slides 7 through 15 provide more detail on our rate filings. Realized gross profit in our nonregulated operations increased $2.5 million in the quarter and $25.3 million for the current 9 months. Slides 16 and 17 provide the details for our nonregulated segments. AEM's delivered gas business drove the quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit as higher per unit margins offset a 2% decrease in sales volumes. Year-to-date, sales volumes increased about 11%, primarily due to the colder weather experienced earlier in the year. The delivered gas business remains AEM's core focus. However, AEM was opportunistic during the volatile natural gas price environment earlier in the year and generated about $24 million in incremental gross profit by accelerating physical gas withdrawal into the second quarter. Shifting now to the expense side of the income statement. The period-over-period increase in O&M expenses was primarily due to the timing and increased levels of pipeline maintenance activities that were undertaken in the current quarter, coupled with the timing of the recognition of higher variable incentive compensation expense earlier in the fiscal year as a result of increased operating results. Earlier this year, the distribution segment also experienced increased standby and overtime costs as our employees were focused on ensuring the safety and reliability of our distribution system during the cold weather. As previously discussed, 2 legal matters related to the nonregulated segment were resolved during the 9 months, resulting in lower O&M for that segment. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2014. Based on strong year-to-date earnings performance through our third fiscal quarter, we are reaffirming the fiscal 2014 guidance range of $2.80 to $2.90 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins. Slide 19 details our net income and expense projections. We project regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $256 million to $267 million. Our nonregulated business is expected to generate net income of $17 million to $19 million in fiscal 2014. We continue our focus on strategic infrastructure capital spending to enhance the safety and reliability of our systems. While timing differences exist through the third quarter, our budget range of $830 million to $850 million has not changed for fiscal 2014. Thank you for your time. And now, I'll had the call back over to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you very much, Bret, a stellar report. Exceptional results, if I must say so myself. Now as we look forward to the remainder of the fiscal year and begin to plan for the next heating season, there are a few observations worth noting. We have experienced a reduction in gas prices, which is very positive news for our customers. There's an increased emphasis on refilling storage at these lower prices, which bodes very well for future gas prices as we hedge out our expected needs for next winter. Generally speaking, a lower gas price environment, which we're seeing now, helps alleviate rate pressure associated with our increased capital spending program. We operate in very constructive regulatory environments with regulators who recognize that safety is greatly enhanced with infrastructure investment, which is encouraged by favorable rate mechanisms that reduce lag. In June, the Public Utility Commission in Louisiana voted to modify the existing rate stabilization cost and authorized an infrastructure mechanism very similar to the Rule 8.209 in Texas, authorizing deferral treatment. With this action, the commission is encouraging increased capital spending in Louisiana to enhance system safety and reliability for all customers and reducing the lag for recovery of this investment. Last week, we submitted our annual Kentucky Pipe Replacement Program filing for $4.3 million. This filing to increase rates should go into effect on October 1, 2014. Other enhanced infrastructure replacement mechanisms exist in our Virginia and Mississippi jurisdictions. We plan to submit a couple of more rate filings by the end of our fiscal year in September, seeking increases in operating income of $10 million to $15 million. Lastly, our $33 million Mid-Tex Rate Review Mechanism filing was appealed to the Texas Railroad Commission on May 30. The issue on appeal is whether our filing conforms to the terms of the established Rate Review Mechanism tariff with the city's. The filed rates became effective subject to refund June 1, and the appeal is scheduled for hearing in early September. We've stayed the course, and we continue to believe that investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use for our capital. We are committed to delivering dependable, consistent and long-term shareholder value. We're projecting transparent, above-average 9% to 10% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% annual earnings growth in fiscal 2018. Coupled with the dividend yield, total annual return is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range through fiscal 2018. That, in a nutshell, is the investment proposition for Atmos Energy. We do appreciate your time, and we're now ready to take any questions. Melissa?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Sorry, I had to jump on a little late this morning, so if you all covered this, I do apologize. But just one quick one for me, Bret, could you perhaps talk about the gross margin upside we saw on the nonregulated side this quarter? Was some of that still attributable to weather factors we saw this year?
Bret J. Eckert: I think it's that and falling gas prices a little bit. As you know, as we run through this, we do anticipate a slight loss in the fourth quarter largely due on the net settlement of the financial positions we executed during the first half of the year. We accelerated physical withdrawals into the first half to capture the incremental margin. The loss, as we expected on the back half, were coming in a little bit smaller than we had previously estimated and that was really driven by the falling prices, gas prices during the last few months. We do expect to see a slight increase in transportation costs associated with seasonal storage injections, Spencer, as we refill storage in anticipation of the upcoming season, but a lot of it is just timing. We still expect nonregulated earnings to be in the $17 million, $19 million range as previously communicated.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Ms. Giles, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back to you for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Great. Thank you, Melissa. Just to remind you all, there is a replay on our website through February 5. I'm around all day, if you have any questions, and we appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Thank you so much. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy's Fiscal Year 2014 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Giles, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. Our earnings release, conference call slide presentation and our 10-Q as filed last night are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 20 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us again in this second quarter and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. We had a wonderful second quarter driven by much colder conditions throughout all of our service territories. Our service technicians and fieldworkers are truly a team of impact players. Their training, their attitude, their energy and dedication were clearly demonstrated as they provided safe and reliable service to all of our customers during long periods of sustained cold weather. We had many great performances by all of them worthy of Oscar awards. Our financial performance followed with reported second quarter consolidated net income of $133 million or $1.38 per diluted share compared to $116 million or $1.27 per share 1 year ago. As a result, we are increasing our earnings guidance from the previous range of $2.66 to $2.76 to $2.80 to $2.90 per diluted share and Bret is going to provide more detail of that increased guidance. Many of our peers, as you know, have reported results which reflect colder weather this winter. While that has driven some of our performance, our strategy to grow by investing in our regulated infrastructure, which we announced and initiated in fiscal '12, has continued to contribute exceptional operational and financial outcomes. Our system was tested operationally during the sustained periods of cold weather this winter and we delivered reliable and safe service to meet this increased customer demand. And this has been critically important, and the recent capital investments spent to fortify our systems allowed all of this to transpire. Other important and recent accomplishments include the approval of the Atmos Pipeline-Texas GRIP filing on May 6 by the Texas Railroad Commission in the amount of $45.6 million. The pipeline also just executed a 10-year contract with Targa Resources, which will commence in October 2014. That contract will enable us to add infrastructure and compression in the Permian Basin to increase the capacity of our pipeline by 210,000 mmbtu per day and it will provide valuable and new sources of gas supply over that 10-year period for our gas distribution customer. In mid-February, you'll recall we completed the sale of 9.2 million shares of common stock in our first public offering since 2006. The shares were priced at $44. We felt market conditions were optimal at this time to issue equity and we would be able -- and were able to absorb the effect of dilution as a result of the colder-than-normal weather and constructive rate outcomes. Net proceeds from the offering of $390 million were used to repay short-term debt; to fund infrastructure spending, primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system; and for general corporate purposes. The offering has allowed us to share our growth strategy into a wider audience as we have become more liquid and our market cap has crossed the $5 billion threshold. Also, our sell-side coverage has been expanded with the addition of JPMorgan, who initiated coverage on April 21. Our debt capital ratio at March 31 was 44%, with no short-term debt outstanding and our liquidity remains strong with over $1 billion of capacity from our short-term facilities. We also successfully resolved 2 legal matters related to our nonregulated marketing operations. Finally, I want to mention that as a result of the continued stable and reliable earnings, our Board of Directors on Tuesday of this week declared our 122nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend and the indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '14 is $1.48, which is a 5.7% increase over the 2013 annual dividend rate. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Bret Eckert. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 detailed reported net income and income excluding net unrealized margin for the 3- and 6-month periods of 2014 and 2013. Excluding unrealized margins, earnings per diluted share increased 10%, from $1.25 for the second quarter last year to $1.37 in the current quarter. For the 6 months, earnings per diluted share rose 14%, from $1.99 last year to $2.26 for the current 6 months. Weather was 25% colder than last year, resulting in higher throughput across all segments of our business and, coupled with natural gas price volatility, increased consolidated year-to-date gross profit by about $42 million. Increased customer consumption at the LDC and higher throughput and related margins at APT contributed $19 million of this increase. The remaining $23 million increase was realized in our nonregulated operations. Although the delivered gas business remains its core focus, AEM was able to accelerate physical withdrawals into the second quarter to generate incremental gross profit in a volatile natural gas price environment. As Kim mentioned, investing in our infrastructure to enhance the safety and the reliability of our system is our primary strategy and these investments helped our utilities perform very well when needed most. Recovery of these investments also drove gross profit increases in our regulated operations for the 3 and 6 months. Slide 4 outlines gross profit in our regulated distribution business and Slide 5 details gross profit from our regulated intrastate pipeline, APT, for the 3-month and 6-month periods. Rate increases lifted distribution gross profit by $13.2 million in the quarter and $15.3 million for the current 6 months. In addition, increases from APT's annual GRIP filings increased rates by $7.3 million in the quarter and $14.1 million for the 6 months. Slides 14 and 15 detail results for our nonregulated segment. Realized gross profit increased $14.3 million in the quarter and $22.8 million for the current 6 months. Deliveries of natural gas increased 23% during the second quarter and about 17% year-to-date due to the impact of colder weather, offset by a slight decrease in per unit margins. However, as I previously mentioned, price volatility resulted in realization of incremental gross profit in the current year. Shifting now to the expense side of the income statement. The increase in O&M was primarily due to the timing of recognition of higher variable incentive compensation expense, as a result of increased operating results. The distribution segment also experienced increased standby and overtime costs and lower labor capitalization rates, as our employees were focused on ensuring the safety and reliability of our distribution system during the cold weather. Additionally, 2 litigation matters related to the nonregulated segment were resolved during the quarter resulting in lower O&M for that segment. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2014. As Kim mentioned, we have increased our earnings guidance for fiscal 2014, primarily due to strong earnings through the first half of fiscal 2014, bolstered by weather that was about 20% colder than normal for the 6 months. We now expect fiscal 2014 earnings per share to range between $2.80 to $2.90 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins at September 30, 2014. Slide 17 details revised net income and expense projections. We now project regulated operations to generate net income in the range of $256 million to $267 million in fiscal '14. Our year-to-date experience, coupled with the continued execution of our rate strategy, should drive this year's results. We anticipate operating income increases of between $110 million and $130 million on an annualized basis from approved rate outcomes in the year. As of May 6, about $83 million in operating income increases, again on an annualized basis, have been approved and rate actions filed and pending totaled $60 million. We expect to file another 4 to 6 cases by the end of the fiscal year, and in total, would request an additional $15 million to $20 million of annual revenue increases. In addition, APT's demand fees were updated during the quarter to reflect current peak-day needs of its regulated customers, which should provide incremental gross profit on a go-forward basis. Slides 7 through 13 provide more details on our rate proceedings and outcomes. Turning to the nonregulated business. We now expect fiscal year '14 net income to be between $17 million and $19 million, excluding unrealized margins. We currently anticipate breakeven results in the back half of fiscal '14 after accelerating physical withdrawals into the second quarter to capture incremental margin. O&M expense is now expected to range between $475 million and $490 million, driven by increased variable compensation, coupled with higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities expected to occur in the latter half of the fiscal year. Our capital budget range is not changed and remains between $830 million and $850 million for fiscal '14. Thank you for your time. And I'll now hand this call back over to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Bret. Excellent report about an excellent quarter that we had. We do continue to focus on delivering natural gas safely and reliably to our customers. Atmos Energy is the second largest pure natural gas utility in the country with about 95% of our annual earnings derived from our regulated operations and we continue to project 9% to 10% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% annual earnings growth through fiscal 2018, with no equity offerings anticipated through that same period. Coupled with the 3% dividend yield, total annual shareholder return is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range through fiscal 2018. We are resolute, as we said many times on our commitment that we made in 2012, that investing in the safety and reliability of our system is the highest and best use of our capital as we strive to be the safest utility in the country. We certainly appreciate your time this morning and we're now ready to take questions. Kevin?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Spencer Joyce from Hilliard Lyons.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Looks like might not be the only one that's thinking that, too, with the way the stock's been acting the past couple of days. In any case, just one real quick one from me and, Bret, this might be for you. If we look out to October, we have -- I'm seeing $0.5 billion or so of long-term notes due. Have you all announced a plan for that, should we be thinking about an upsize or a refi or refresh me, do we have any interest rate locks or anything in place for that?
Bret J. Eckert: We do. It's a great question. There are $500 million 30-year senior notes that are currently at 4.95% due mature in October of 2014, which is our fiscal year '15. We have put a forward-starting swap about 1.5 years ago on that issuance effectively fixing the treasury yield at 3.129%. We do plan to obviously issue senior notes, 30-year senior notes to replace that expiring tranche of debt. We're currently looking at that. We may upsize that facility slightly as we get closer to that, but that's our current plan. And keep in mind, Spencer, we've also put forward-starting swaps on our expiring issuance that follows that in June of 2017, $250 million, 30-year notes that is effectively fixed at 3.36% and then we began in this quarter layering on some forward-starting swaps on the March 2019, we have $450 million of 8.5% 10-year senior notes, we've right now put forward-starting swaps in a little over 60% of that issuance, fixing the treasury at about 3.95%. So we continue to take advantage of this low interest-rate environment, allowing us to continue to fund our growth.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Yes, that's fantastic, I'll add those notes in and make those adjustments. In any case, pretty clean quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Todd Derderian from John Hancock.
Todd Victor Derderian: My question is pretty simple. Obviously, you've done some great investment in CT [ph] in reliability, which has been the key to your undeniably strong results. Should the spending mix that's currently in the high 60s be consistent through 2018? And do you anticipate any problems with existing regulatory lag, which you're working very hard to reduce?
Bret J. Eckert: No, I think we've announced that we continue to see spending levels from a capital expenditure standpoint of 850 to 950 through 2018 with that investment continued focusing on our infrastructure to enhance the safety and the reliability of our system. We remain laser focused on regulatory execution and will continue to look to earn a fair return on investments.
Kim R. Cocklin: And Todd, the regulators are also very interested in ensuring that the infrastructure in their jurisdictions is the most safe and reliable that it can be, and it's state-of-the-art. So we've been working as a partnership with the safety divisions and with the regulators and have come up with what we see and find is very acceptable treatment for our investment. And as Bret pointed out, we've also focused on taking a great deal of time to focus on ensuring that we have the appropriate strategy, then financial engineering in place to fund that through fiscal '18 by continuing to try to stay ahead and take advantage of the low interest rates for the expiring issuances during the same period, the '15s and the '17s and then the '19 debt. So it's a program that's going to continue and it's working very, very well and paying great dividends for our customers, for our regulators and for our shareholders, but the biggest emphasis from our standpoint is safety. We want to be the safest utility in the United States and we want our employees to be the best trained and to strive to be incident-free every day and we try to remind each other as we wake up to do that.
Todd Victor Derderian: Well, I think with your good relations with the regulators that you are well on your way to maintaining that reputation. And lastly, with the quarterly dividend, we couldn't be more pleased with that continued consecutive raise and declaration and percentage.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] If there are no further questions, I'm going to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.
Susan Giles: Well, thank you, all, for joining us. We will have a recording of the call available for replay on our website through August 6, and I will be here all day if you have any further questions. Again, we appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us.
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-02-05 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim Cocklin - President and Chief Executive Officer Bret Eckert - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Gabe Moreen - Bank of America
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Fiscal 2014 First Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles from Atmost Energy Corporation. Thank you, Ms. Giles, you may now begin.
Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations: Good morning, everyone, thank you all for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the Conference Call link. Additionally, the company's Form 10-Q was filed last night and is also available on our website. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 18 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, very much, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported first quarter consolidated net income of $87 million or $0.95 per diluted share compared to $80 million or $0.88 per diluted share one year ago. After excluding unrealized margins in both periods, net income was $81 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the current quarter compared to $67 million or $0.74 last year. Regulated operations contributed 94% of our earnings. The execution of our regulatory strategy continues to drive our financial performance and has improved the stability and predictability of earnings for the enterprise. Also, colder than normal weather positively impacted financial results in both our regulated and non-regulated segments this first quarter. Our liquidity and financial position remained strong. Our debt capitalization ratio was 54.2% at December 31 compared with 53.5% one year ago. Last week, we were up in news from Moody's who upgraded our debt rating to A2 with a stable outlook. The agency upgraded our rating two notches versus one notch for most other US utilities. Moody's cited our jurisdictional diversity and our success in increasing and stabilizing regulated margins to rate increases and rate design improvement as a rationale for the upgrade. Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared our 121st consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '14 is $1.48, which is 5.7% increase over the '13 annual dividend rate. We remain very focused on enhancing system safety and reliability through infrastructure investment and delivering shareholder value and consistent earnings growth. For the calendar year ended December 31, we delivered total return to our shareholders of nearly 43%. Our CFO, Bret Eckert, will review our financial results in great detail and then we'll return with the closing comments and open the call up for questions. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. If you follow me on Slide 2, reported net income for the quarter was $87 or $0.95 per diluted share compared with $80 million or $0.88 one year ago, as Kim said. Excluding unrealized margins in both periods, net income was $81 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared with $67 million or $0.74 per share last year. Results in the prior year included $3 million of income from discontinued operations from the Georgia distribution assets, which were sold in April 2013. The first quarter of fiscal 2014 was strong mainly due to colder weather, which as Kim mentioned positively affected each of our segments. Colder weather drove higher customer consumption across our distribution service territories. The cold weather increased transportation volumes in our transition and storage segment, ATT, and also increased delivered volumes and margins in our non-regulated segments. Turning to Slide 3, in the current quarter, gross profit in our natural gas distribution segment increased by about $20 million, $11 million of the increase is the result of weather that was 30% colder than last year, which drove a 19% in distribution throughput as a result of substantially colder weather, particularly in December. Rate increases contributed another $2 million. Finally, revenue-related taxes increased by $5 million, primarily due to higher revenues in the Mid-Tex division. However, this increase had no material impact to operating income as the associated tax expense increased by about the same amount. Turning to Slide 4, our regulated interstate pipeline, Atmos Pipeline Texas, generated almost $11 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter. About $7 million of that amount reflects the impact of our GRIP filing that became effective in May of 2013. APT also experienced an increase of about $1.4 million from higher transportation volume due to the colder weather. Turning now to our non-regulated segment and you may want to turn to Slide 12. Gross profit decreased about $4 million in our non-regulated segment, mainly as a result of an $8.5 million increase in realized margins offset by $12 million decrease in unrealized margins quarter-over-quarter. Realized margins for gas delivery and related services increased $2.4 million due to an increase in gas delivery per unit margins to $0.12 per Mcf from $0.10 a year ago. The increase in per unit margins reflects the impact of higher margin incremental sales, particularly in December as a result of the colder weather coupled with a 9% increase in consolidated sales volumes through other utilities, municipalities and industrial customers. Additionally, we experienced a $6.1 million in other realized margins, primarily due to the timing and magnitude of losses realized on the settlement of financial position quarter-over-quarter. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. O&M increased by $9 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to higher employee-related expense. The increase reflects annual merit increases, increased employee benefit cost and lower capitalization rates associated with the lower capital spending in the current quarter. Details about our capital spending are presented on Slide 5. As you can see, CapEx decreased $9.5 million in the first quarter compared to one year ago. Spending in our natural gas distribution segment decreased about $18 million due to our crew's inability to perform construction work and the winter weather experienced in December. In addition, some of the studies related to some of the projects delayed our interest for 2014, which were originally slated for the October to December timeframe. Lastly, the prior year quarter includes spending on a new customer information system that was completed last spring. These decreases were partially offset by a $9.5 million from spending in Atmos Pipeline Texas. In the first quarter, APT completed its Line WX expansion project in the DSW area and performed higher levels of cathotic protection work to enhance the safety of the pipeline. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2014, as a reminder, our practice is to provide annual earnings guidance only. We expect fiscal 2014 earnings per share at the end of previously announced range of between $2.66 to $2.76 per diluted share excluding unrealized margins. We expect a continued execution of our rate strategy to be the primary driver for the year's result. Looking on Slide 25, we anticipate annual operating income increases of between $110 million and $130 million from improved rate outcomes in the year. In the first quarter, weather was 21% colder than normal and O&M was lower than expected primarily due to the weather. As the weather improves, we anticipate our crews will catch up on work initially slated for our first quarter. As a result, the O&M run rate for the remainder of the year should be higher than what we experienced in the first quarter, but still within our previously announced targeted range, as shown on Page 15. Looking at Slide 16, our capital budget range has not changed. It remains between $830 million and $850 million for fiscal 2014. We will continue to finance these investments via cash flows, long-term debt securities and equities, while maintaining a sound capital structure. Most importantly, our financing plan has been reflected in both our 2014 earnings per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.76 per diluted share and our plans to grow EPS by 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time and now I'll hand the call back over to Kim.
Cocklin: Thank you, Bret, and great report. We are certainly encouraged by our earnings report for this first quarter of fiscal '14, which really represents another successful chapter in our growth story that we announced at the beginning of fiscal '12. Our fundamental business continues to be delivering safe and reliable natural gas service to our customers and successful execution of our rate strategy is critical to meeting our financial commitments of growing earnings per share 6% to 8% through fiscal '18 annually, as Bret said. In the first quarter of fiscal '14, we did complete a number of rate proceedings, which when combined with regulatory expense deferrals results in an increase of about $18.6 million in annual operating income. The bulk of this came from 2012 Mid-Tex city's rate review mechanism filing of $12.5 million. We also currently have several rate actions that are filed and pending, which total about $43 million in request and intend to file another 10 to 12 cases this fiscal year that in total would request about $90 million. You can see Slide 7 through 11 providing more detail on these rate cases. On a regulated instrastate pipeline, Atmos Pipeline Texas, we continue to invest capital to increase capacity, secure long-term gas supply and enhance the reliability of our service in critical locations on the Mid-Tex system. Capital expenses are GRIP eligible again with an 11.8% return on equity. Fiscal '13 was the third year of the three-year pilot program for the Rider REV on our APT pipeline, and we did request an extension of that Rider REV in late fiscal '13. And in December, the Texas Railroad Commission did grant an extension of this Rider until November 2017. That Rider is an annual mechanism that adjusts regulated rates by tracking any difference between APT's non-regulated annual revenue and a benchmark credit of $84 million and sharing that difference 75% to customers and 25% to the company. We remain very focused on executing our capital plan of strategically spending between $850 million and $950 million annually through fiscal '18 to enhance the safety and reliability of our system. We're firmly committed to delivering dependable long-term financial success and do intend to grow earnings per share 6% to 8% annually through fiscal '18. We thank you very much for your time, your interest and will open the call up now for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen from Bank of America.
Gabe Moreen - Bank of America: Two questions from me. One, Bret, just wondering if you can walk a little bit through more of the O&M drivers. I think O&M came in a bit higher than we were expecting this quarter. You said it'd still be within your guidance, but sounds like you're still expecting a decent growth rate in O&M for the remaining quarters. Can you just maybe walk us through the drivers a little bit more on that?
Bret Eckert: Yeah, Gabe, good question. It really is just driven by the weather. If you look at the first quarter of last year, it was warmer, we got a big jumpstart last year in our CapEx, just like CapEx in the first quarter was higher and that caused O&M to be lower. We kind of had the reverse situation this quarter again, significantly colder than normal, lagging behind both the CapEx and O&M plans. And with that said, Slide 15 has our O&M range of $470 million to $480 million, which is lower than 2013 O&M of $488 million. So it's really just timing with regard to the weather and the crew's ability to get out and manage through it.
Gabe Moreen - Bank of America: And shifting gears, Kim, theirs is some info in public out there that there's a couple of gas utility properties out there on the market. Can you speak to your appetite for potentially looking at some of those properties and whether Atmos will be looking at those?
Kim Cocklin: We haven't heard any of that. We've heard the same rumors as you heard. And we have publicly expressed our position that our growth strategy continues to be focused on investing in our infrastructure and having a capital budget of $850 million to $950 million every year through fiscal '18. We're not interested in pursuing any acquisitions. We think that the prices are not within a reasonable range. They certainly provide the same opportunity for growth long-term for our shareholders or short-term and they won't generate the accretion that we're showing certainly this first quarter and when we started our program in '12. So no, we're sticking to our commitment that we made beginning in '12 that the best growth and the highest and best use for our capital is investing it in our infrastructure and making our system much safer and trying to pursue our goal of becoming the safest natural gas utility in the country. So no, we're not interested, we're not looking to add growth through anybody that might be on the market. I don't know if I could be anymore clearer than that, but I hope that answers the question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We have no further questions at this time.
Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations: A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through May the 5th. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us this morning. Good bye.

===== 2013 Q4  (2013-11-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim R. Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret J. Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you, Miss, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to a few of the slides during this live call and will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the Conference Call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company's Form 10-K no later than next week. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 29 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements, and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, very much, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us, and again, your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported exceptional results for fiscal 2013. After excluding the gain on the sale of Georgia and unrealized margins, consolidated net income was $233 million or $2.53 per diluted share. compared to $212 million or $2.31 per share one year ago, a 9.5% increase in adjusted earnings per share year-over-year. As you recall, we did close the sale of our Georgia distribution assets earlier than planned in April of 2013, receiving a $153 million and recording an after-tax gain of $5.3 million or $0.06 per share. However, our operational and financial performance grew more than strong enough to absorb the 6 months of lost income as a result of the sale. Monetizing our non-core distribution assets over the last 2 years has really allowed us to redeploy the cash proceeds into our remaining portfolio of regulated assets, generating much better returns. These investments in safety and reliability were made possible by our constructive partnership with our regulators and customers, who understand and embrace making safety our top priority. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our financial profile this past year. We amended our revolving credit agreement to extend the term through 2018, and increased our borrowing capacity to $950 million which, coupled with the accordion feature, effectively expands our credit capacity to $1.2 billion. We also terminated Atmos Energy Marketing's $200 million committed facility and replaced it with a $50 million of capacity through 2 1-year facilities, which resulted in lower external credit expense in our nonregulated operations. In January 2013, we issued 30-year unsecured senior notes in the amount of $500 million at a rate of 4.15%. These replaced $250 million of notes, carrying a 10-year term and an interest rate of 5 1/8%. As a result, our weighted average cost of debt has decreased to 6.2%, and our average maturities have been extended to almost 15 years. Standard & Poor's recognized our continued effort to strengthen our balance sheet. In early October, S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating to A- from BBB+, with a ratings outlook of Stable, citing an improved business risk profile. And of course, yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 5.7% increase to our quarterly dividend. The fiscal 2014 indicated dividend rate is now at $1.48 per share, an increase of $0.08. This dividend increase, which is more commensurate with our earnings per share growth, is supported by our regulated operating and financial performance. With this increase, our dividend payout ratio remains at about 55% and continues to position us very well for delivering superior shareholder returns. Our commitment to increasing shareholder value remains a top priority. For the year ended September 30, we delivered a total return to shareholders of over 23%. Bret Eckert, our CFO will discuss the financial results for fiscal '13 and the outlook for 2014. Then we'll return for some closing comments before taking questions. Thank you. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. If you follow me on Slide 3, reported net income was $243 million or $2.64 per diluted share, compared with $217 million or $2.37 one year ago. As Kim mentioned, we completed the sale for our distribution assets in Georgia this past April. So the corresponding gain of $5.3 million or $0.06 is included in the results for the current year. I'll remind you that last year included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling $10 million or $0.11 per share. Earnings were $233 million or $2.53 per share in the current year, compared with $212 million or $2.31 per share last year, after excluding net unrealized margins, the gains on the sale and the prior-year onetime items. The execution of our regulatory strategy is driving our financial performance and has improved the stability and predictability of earnings for the enterprise. In fiscal 2013, we completed rate proceedings in our combined regulated operations, resulting in a $122 million annual increase to operating income. As you can see on Slide 5, distribution gross profit increased by $59 million for the year and about $43 million for the quarter compared to the same period one year ago. The increase in both periods was driven from rate increases across all of our divisions, with the largest increases occurring in our Mid-Tex and West Texas jurisdictions. You will recall that rate outcomes in our Texas jurisdiction increased the customer base charge and decreased the commodity charge applied to customer consumption. Therefore, as expected, margins shifted out of the first and second fiscal quarters and into the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2013. Turning to Slide 6. Our regulated interstate pipeline, Atmos Pipeline-Texas, generated over $21 million of incremental margin during fiscal 2013, with about $7 million earned during the fourth quarter. These increases reflect the impact of our 2012 and 2013 GRIP filings. This past May, the Texas Railroad Commission approved APT's 2013 GRIP filing, with an annual operating income increase of $26.7 million that went into effect that month. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. O&M for the year increased about $34 million. We experienced an increase in pipeline and right-of-way maintenance work in our regulated operations. Additionally, throughout the year, we experienced higher line locate expenses from increased construction in the DFW Metroplex, and that drove the demand for locating gas lines. We also experienced rising costs associated with higher employee salary and benefits expense, coupled with increased variable compensation expense related to fiscal year 2013 performance. In addition, we experienced higher bad debt expense this year from increased revenues and temporary suspension of active customer collection activity, following the implementation of a new customer information system during the third fiscal quarter. These increases were offset by decreases in administrative expenses and depreciation expense due to new depreciation rates approved in the most recent Mid-Tex rate case. Finally, our non-regulated operations continued to be a valuable contributor to our consolidated results, with net income of about $6 million for the fiscal year, excluding the market. We experienced a slight decrease in consolidated sales volumes due to increased competition, which reduced industrial and power generation sales, along with per unit margins decreasing from $0.116 per Mcf to $0.10 per Mcf. Nonregulated earnings were also impacted by higher litigation costs that we do not expect to repeat in future periods. Turning to capital expenditures. Fiscal 2013 CapEx increased $112 million to $845 million for the year. The increase reflects our commitment to increase infrastructure investments across our distribution system, as well as spending on pipeline extension projects and increased cathodic protection at APT. Moving now to earnings guidance for fiscal 2014. We have announced our fiscal 2014 earnings per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.76 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins, and have updated the expected contribution of regulated and non-regulated operations. Let me draw your attention to Slide 16 to 18, where we've outlined our budget assumptions and net income for fiscal 2014. We expect continued successful execution of our rate strategy to be the primary driver for next year's results. We anticipate annual operating income increases of between $110 million and $130 million from approved rate outcomes in fiscal 2014. Normal weather, weighted average GAAP cost purchases to be in the range of $4 to $6 per Mcf. We expect the regulated business to generate between $237 and $247 million of net income in fiscal 2014. Our nonregulated business is expected to generate net income in the $9 million to $11 million range, with an assumption of nonregulated delivered gas volumes of between 390 Bcf and 410 Bcf at a per unit margin of $0.10 to $0.11. Consolidated net income for fiscal 2014 ranges between $246 million to $258 million, with an estimated 92 million to 94 million average diluted shares. Slide 21 provides filing -- rate filing outlook for the upcoming year. As I mentioned, we anticipate approved increases to annual operating income of between $110 million and $130 million in fiscal '14, which will continue to drive our earnings. Slide 22 gives the historical comparison to fiscal '14 projections for several expense categories. As you can see, key drivers from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 include lower O&M in the $8 million to $18 million range. Due to lower employee salary expenses, variable compensation returned to the base levels. We also expect a more normal run rate for bad debt expense in fiscal 2014; increased depreciation expense, ranging from $13 million to $20 million, primarily as a result of increased capital investments; and increased interest expense of $2 million to $7 million, largely due to higher short-term debt borrowing cost. We will continue on our path to invest capital on our gas infrastructure and utilize regulatory mechanisms that reduce or eliminate lag and financially support the investment. If you turn to Slide 23, we project spending between $830 million and $850 million in fiscal 2014. Regulated CapEx is all but about $1 million of the annual total and is largely driven by expenditures for enhanced infrastructure replacement programs, such as those in Texas and Kentucky, among others. The majority of CapEx over $500 million will be spent on safety and compliance, focused on system and pipeline integrity projects. We'll spend approximately another $150 million on expansion, which includes spending at Atmos Pipeline-Texas along with compression projects and new customer additions on the distribution system. Finally, we'll spend $100 million to $115 million on improvement, including relocations, fortification, measurement and road projects. I'll remind you that we have rate provisions and timely rates filings, which should result in about 95% of our 2014 regulated capital being included to the rate base and providing a return on the investment within 12 months of spend. We have also updated our 5-year plan through fiscal year 2018 as shown, on Slides 25 to 27. Looking forward to Slide 26, our infrastructure growth opportunities have grown faster than originally anticipated and we now expect to invest approximately $850 million to $950 million annually through fiscal 2018 in enhancing the safety and the reliability of our regulated operations. We will continue to finance these investments via cash flows, long-term debt securities and, to lesser extent, equity. Most importantly, our financing plans has been reflected in both our 2014 earnings per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.76 per diluted share, as well as our commitment to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2018. Thank you for your time this morning, and now, I'll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, very much, Bret, for a great report. As you can see, fiscal 2013 was a remarkable year and represented another important chapter in our company's history to deliver increased value to our shareholders. This was our 11th consecutive year in increasing earnings and I believe it's worth noting that this progress continued during critical periods of economic uncertainty and certainly challenging times for our country. We have delivered on our commitment on a sustained basis and this momentum has carried over into fiscal 2014. At September 30, we had rate cases filed and pending for annual operating increases of $44.6 million and have already received approval for annual operating income totaling $12.5 million this year. Increased capital spending and constructive regulatory outcomes are key factors underlying our 2014 guidance of $2.66 to $2.76 per diluted share. Two years ago, we rolled out the parameters of our infrastructure investment growth strategy, which has generated better returns than originally planned, while improving the safety and reliability of our system. There was no sophomore slump for Atmos in fiscal 2013, and we are not backing away from plans to invest in our system. Our expected annual capital spending levels range from $850 million to $950 million through fiscal 2018, and should drive rate base growth. Looking on Slide 25, we do project rate base growth to be between $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion by fiscal 2018. We will continue to execute on our very deliberate rate strategy. This provides a solid platform for continued growth, and we continue to demonstrate to our regulators and customers, our commitment to safety and reliability and keeping our services affordable and competitive. As shown on Slide 27, successful execution of our plan is projected to grow earnings in the 6% to 8% range on an annual basis, which equates to estimated earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.65 by fiscal 2018. So in summary, what is the value proposition for an Atmos shareholder? On a forward P/E basis, we continue to trade at a discount to our peers. Yet, we offer higher-than-expected 5-year total return estimates compared to the peer group. So Atmos Energy is a very unique investment with very focused strategy, a solid financial foundation and a solid track record of creating shareholder value. Earnings have grown consistently and predictably, and we offer a competitive dividend whose growth is now better aligned with our earnings growth. Thank you very much for your time this morning, and we will open up the call for questions. Donna?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A few questions for me -- really mostly on the guidance here. So I just want to understand the $110 million to $130 million of operating income we're looking for in 2014. I think you said you've got $12.5 million done with the Mid-Tex and then, you got sort of $46 million or so filed. I'm just trying to -- can you help or just -- where else we're expecting to get these increases? Because obviously, Mid-Tex is one of your biggest jurisdictions.
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes. You'll have the Mid-Tex RRM, you'll have the GRIP filing that obviously comes in, Ted, as we get into the early spring. As you run through that and then, the rest of your filings are fairly typical from what we have year-over-year, commensurate with the increased investment.
Bret J. Eckert: We got -- Slide 21, if you look at that. I think that identifies most of everything that we're going to anticipate filing.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And so these increases, these will be filed and sort of accepted, but may not fully hit the earning -- in other words, you've got some carryover from last year's that are coming through into this year's increases. I'm trying to follow the sort of the time frame.
Kim R. Cocklin: Oh, yes. Yes, you are correct. I mean, the $110 million to $130 million is the annual impact. If you look at the impact that we expected to have in fiscal '14, it's somewhere in the $80 million to $90 million range.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. You made some comments around O&M, and I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit more on that in terms of the year-over-year decrease, because it did look like the fourth quarter came in pretty high. I'm just kind of, make it, trying to understand all the mechanics there of why we have the year-over-year decrease in '14 versus '13?
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes, I think a lot of it is related to salary expense. We have higher variable compensation in fiscal '13, as you would expect, with the stronger-than-expected earnings. We did have the new system implementation in the quarter where we did spend collections for a period of time as we go through that implementation. And we've got that turned on across all of the division. And we did have a slight run-up in bad debt expenses in fiscal 2013, that we do not anticipate reoccurring in '14. So that's a piece of it, somewhat offset, obviously, on the depreciation side. But those are really the main drivers from an O&M perspective.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then last one for me. Just you've got this -- you talked about having the need for equity at some point down the road. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of the size that you might need and the timing. And then thoughts about how you might actually get that done, if you'd sort of dribble it out or do an overnight or how kind of how are you thinking about that?
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes. As you would expect, Ted, we're going to continue to be opportunistic in the timing and the nature of meeting our financing plans to fund our rate base growth opportunities, whether or not it's an overnight, whether or not it's a blocked trade, or a dribble or a forward, we'll look at all options available when we get to that point. And I'd direct you to Slide 17, where we've included our 2014 estimate of earnings, as well as average diluted shares. Our financing plans, as I've said, have been reflected in both our 2014 earnings per share guidance as well as our commitment to grow earnings by 6% to 8% annually for 2018. And we don't plan on doing anything from a financing perspective that would impact our ability to deliver on those commitments.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We're showing no further questions at this time. Ms. Giles, I'll turn the floor back over to you for any additional or closing comments.
Susan Giles: Great. Thank you, Donna. And I just want to remind everyone that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February 4. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. And thank you for joining us this morning. Goodbye.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-08-07 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim R. Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret J. Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Analysts: Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to a few of the slides during the call and we'll be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later today. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here as well to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 2 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Susan, very much, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported third quarter consolidated net income of $39 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $31 million or $0.34 per diluted share one year ago. For the 9 months, reported earnings were $2.57 per share compared with $2.28 last year. As you recall, we've closed the sale of our Georgia distribution assets on April 1 for $153 million. This quarter, we recorded an after-tax gain of $5.3 million on the sale or $0.06 per diluted share. The net proceeds are being reinvested in our regulated capital investment opportunities. This sale, along with the sale of our Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa distribution assets last year, delivers on our commitment to become more geographically efficient and continues our sharp focus on growing our regulated Rate Base by 8% to 8.5% by the end of our fiscal 2016. As a result of our strong financial performance for the first 9 months, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced earnings guidance of between $2.45 and $2.55 per diluted share, excluding the March and the gain on the Georgia sale. Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared our 119th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '13 is $1.40 per share. Our commitment to increasing and sustaining shareholder value remains a top priority. For the 12 months ended June 30, we've delivered a total return to shareholders of 22%. Our CFO, Bret Eckert, will review our financial results in greater detail, then we'll return for closing comments and take your questions. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. If you follow me on Slide 3, fiscal third quarter earnings, excluding net unrealized margins and the gain on the sale of Georgia, were approximately $40 million or $0.42 per share, compared with $29 million or $0.32 per share 1 year ago. Now turning to the 9 months period on Slide 4. Earnings, excluding net unrealized margins and the gain on Georgia were $221 million or $2.40 per share in the current year, compared with $202 million or $2.20 per share last year. As Kim mentioned, we completed the sale of our distribution assets in Georgia on April 1, and the gain of $5.3 million or $0.06 is included in the results for the quarter. Rate relief remains a primary driver of our success in the distribution business. Looking now on Slide 5 for the current quarter and 9-month period, distribution gross profit increased by $44 million in the quarter and about $15 million to the 9 months compared to the same period 1 year ago. The increase this quarter is primarily a result of the shift in margins from the rate design changes in Texas we have been discussing this year. As a reminder, the new rate design increased the customer's monthly base charge and decreased the consumption charge. As a result of this change, 84% of our cost of service is recouped through the customer base charge compared to only 41% under the previous rate design as shown on Slide 11, which provides a more stabilized earnings stream to the company. Because of this shift, margin is about $25 million higher than historical results in the fiscal third quarter, and we expect margins from our Texas operations to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013. We also experienced an increase of over $10 million in margins due to colder weather experienced outside of the weather normalization adjustment period across all of our service areas. Turning to Slide 6. Our regulated intrastate pipeline and storage operations, Atmos Pipeline Texas, generated $7 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter and about $15 million in the current 9-month period, reflecting the impact of our 2012 and 2013 GRIP filing. On May 7, the Texas Railroad Commission approved the pipeline's 2013 GRIP filing with an annual operating income increase of $26.7 million that went into effect with the bills rendered on or after May 7. And finally, as detailed on Slide 13, our regulated businesses completed rate proceedings this fiscal year to date, which should result in a $98 million increase in annual operating income. Turning now to our nonregulated operations, and you may want to turn to Slide 15. Total realized margins compared to last year declined $15 million quarter-over-quarter but rose over $3 million for the 9-month period. I'll remind you that in the prior year, AEH took advantage of falling natural gas prices by injecting gas into storage to capture incremental physical to forward spread values and rolling financial positions forward for settlement. Those margins were realized during the third and fourth quarters of last year. Realized margins for gas delivery and related services decreased about $3 million quarter-over-quarter and the 9-month period, mainly due to lower per-unit margins in the current periods compared to 1 year ago. Consolidated sales volumes rose by 3.7 Bcf quarter-over-quarter but decreased 4.6 Bcf in the 9 months. Our nonregulated business had continued to experience increased competition for industrial customers. Power generation sales volumes also decreased as coal prices were less expensive than natural gas prices for power generators. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. O&M for the quarter increased about $15 million and increased by $9 million in the current 9-month period. Both periods experienced rising costs associated with higher employee, legal and other administrative costs, increased demand for line locates in the DFW Metroplex and higher pipeline and right-of-way maintenance activities. Interest charges were about $2 million lower this quarter and about $11 million lower for the current 9 months as a result of interest deferrals related to Texas Infrastructure Rule 8.209 spending in both periods. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2013. Based on continued strong earnings through our third fiscal quarter of 2013, we are reaffirming fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance of $2.45 to $2.55, excluding unrealized margins and the gain on the sale of our Georgia assets. Let me draw your attention to Slide 17 and 18 where we set out our budget assumptions and net income projections by segment. They remain unchanged from last quarter and consolidated net income remains in the range of $224 million to $234 million, with an estimated 91.6 million average diluted shares. Although we expect margins in our Texas jurisdictions of between $25 million to $30 million higher than Q4 of last year, it's important to remember that the fourth quarter is historically a loss quarter, which will affect our other jurisdictions. Additionally, we now expect fiscal 2013 consolidated O&M to tick up a bit in the fourth quarter. We have increased our fiscal 2013 projection to $470 million to $480 million for a number of reasons. We've accelerated pipeline and right-of-way maintenance activities in our regulated operations to further enhance safety and reliability. Line locate expense is on the rise. We've seen an increase in construction, which is driving the demand for locating gas lines in the DFW Metroplex, and we anticipate increased performance-based compensation expense as a result of better-than-planned financial performance. We are optimistic that we can achieve our earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share and consolidated net income between $224 million and $234 million for fiscal 2013. Thank you for your time, and now, I'll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Excellent report, Bret. Thank you very much. As you can see, we continue to successfully execute our rate and regulatory strategy. Year-to-date, completed rate proceedings, as Bret said, have increased operating income by $98 million. We've also added regulatory expense deferrals of another $24 million, resulting in an increase of about $122 million in annual operating income. We have 6 active cases pending requesting annual increases totaling $36 million, the largest of these is the 2012 Mid-Tex RRM filing of $17 million. A few more cases are scheduled to be filed by the end of our fiscal year, requesting increases of another $10 million. Our portfolio of assets has been refined and streamlined. Completing the sale of Georgia allows us to apply an even stronger focus on this portfolio. We're also constantly striving TO strengthen our regulatory relationships. In particular, our regulators recognized the importance of balancing the needs of our customers and our shareholders. They understand the need for expanded safety and reliability investment, coupled with regulatory mechanisms that financially support that investment. In Texas, there's an increased emphasis on all of these policies. The best evidence of last month's revolution -- resolution endorsed by Mr. Barry Smitherman, the current chair of the NARUC Gas Committee and also the chair of the Texas Railroad Commission, and this resolution, which was adopted, encourages investment in gas utilities, the expedited replacement of distribution mains and service lines, coupled with regulatory mechanisms that financially support that investment by eliminating lag. With an average annual investment in our regulated assets of some $800 million through fiscal 2016, we continue to demonstrate to the regulators and customers our absolute commitment to safety and reliability. Atmos Pipeline Texas continues to perform exceptionally well and is securing long-term gas supply to enhance the reliability of our service for the Mid-Tex system. We're still on track to complete Phases 2 and 3 of the Line WX project in December 2013, at a capital cost of $115 million to $118 million to improve reliability and meet peak service needs to areas west of the DFW Metroplex. Construction is also now complete on the installation of 2 1,500-horsepower compressors to move gas to multiple interstate and intrastate pipelines in West Texas near the Permian Basin shale play. Capital expense for this project is approximately $19 million. We remind you that capital expenses for Atmos Pipeline Texas are all GRIP eligible with the opportunity to earn a return on equity of 11.8%. Our nonregulated operations will continue to focus on the delivered gas business to about 1,000 customers. This is an essential business to our distribution divisions, various utilities and other regulated municipalities contracting for firm natural gas supply. The forecasted earnings contribution from this segment is less than 5% of our annual consolidated income. On a consolidated basis, we will continue to execute on our capital plan of strategically spending close to $800 million annually through fiscal '16. Growing our rate base at a compounded annual rate of between 8% and 8.5%, growing earnings of 6% to 8% on a compounded annual basis through fiscal '16. Our story remains consistent and transparent. We're enhancing the safety and reliability of our system for the 3 million customers we serve. We aspire to be the industry leader in safety and training. We're committed to increasing and sustaining shareholder value. We're focused on growing earnings on a consistent and predictable basis and maintaining an attractive dividend yield. We understand how hard it is to gain trust, confidence and credibility in the market. We've delivered on our commitments on a sustained basis, and we believe we can continue this momentum. Thank you for your time and we'll open it up for questions now. Christine?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe I can start with a little bit more of a near-term look here on 2014. I'm sure you're working through the budget as we're coming close to the end of this fiscal year. The -- but just in terms of the 2014, kind of how the budget's looking there in terms of the CapEx but also the amount of rate activity, are we sort of still looking at $800 million of CapEx for '14? And then looking for $90 million to $110 million of rate activity next year as well or just kind of how that's shaping up right now?
Kim R. Cocklin: Well, we know that we're going to invest the $800 million or thereabouts on the capital side of the business. What about the rate outcomes? I don't -- we haven't looked at the rate outcomes, but we're going to -- I mean the growth is going to continue to be at the 8%, 8.5% for rate base by '16. I mean, all of the assumptions haven't changed that we've talked about through the '16 period. You'll see a little bit more clarity and granularity around that when we come back in November for sure, when we push guidance out for '14 and announce capital budgets and everything. But everything seems -- everything's on track. If nothing that's changed -- if anything, we're having much more faith and confidence on our ability to deliver and sustain the commitments that we made, Ted.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. I guess, is it fair to say that as you're growing rate base, your rate request number should go higher over time just off of a larger base? Is that fair, or do you think that $90 million to $110 million is kind of what you need to sort of get closer to your allotted ROE?
Bret J. Eckert: I think you're going to see a balance, Ted. As you continue to make those investments, there's going to be a consistency there at a certain level when you're investing $800 million a year.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's great. And then if I can just ask about the pipeline itself, and realizing that there's obviously support from some of the regulators on the investments. But you do have some of the projects, your major projects, you mentioned Line X is rolling off here at the end of December. Do you have some other larger-scaled projects in the hopper that we should think about again for '14? Or is it going to be more of the smaller type of projects and smaller spending in the pipeline business?
Kim R. Cocklin: Well, we don't have any that we're going to announce. I think for what -- for your purposes, I mean, we've committed to growing rate base at the number we talked about, which translates to earnings growth of 6% to 8%. So whatever numbers you're assuming around rate -- annual rate outcomes or annual revenues from rate outcomes, and we're going to have the investment and the projects to support that level of growth.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then last one for me is just on the dividend here and realizing you are spending a lot of capital, but how you're thinking about the dividend going into the next year, and the payout ratio versus sort of obtaining some cash to reinvest in the business?
Bret J. Eckert: We understand where we are relative to our peers and, obviously, there's a significant appetite for capital right now, the highest and best use. And we think for the return to the shareholder is on the capital side of the business, but we're also mindful. And that discussion occurs every year. And again, we'll have more to say about that when we come back in November when we talk about the indicated dividend yield for 2014. But it's another front burner issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.
Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I guess, maybe I'm misreading this, but can you provide a little bit more clarity on the remaining filed increases for the remainder of the year, and kind of the materiality of those increases? I mean, historically, you have current $98 million increases.
Kim R. Cocklin: You are talking about the $36 million that are pending, $36 million that's pending?
Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Yes. Are any of those effective in the -- fiscal period?
Kim R. Cocklin: No, nothing will be effective in this fiscal period. I think there's a slide on the details of that though. No, all of those would be dropping in next year, '14 so you get a partial year effect in '14. You'd see a full effect in '15. And 2 -- the biggest 2 pieces are the Kentucky rate case and the Mid-Tex RRM.
Kim R. Cocklin: Yes, but the Mid-Tex was $17 million? The Kentucky is like 7 -- about $13 million.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones here for you. With the Georgia asset sale now complete and behind us, are you all pretty comfortable with the current footprint? Can we think of the acquisition and/or divestiture sort of phase 1 of the refocus as mostly complete here?
Kim R. Cocklin: It's all complete. Yes, we're who we are and we love who we are. We love ourselves right now.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Fair enough, fair enough.
Kim R. Cocklin: No, nothing else planned.
Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Okay. Second other little item. I just wanted to touch on the O&M stuff. You mentioned line relocate expenses being ramped up or maybe accelerated a little bit, as well as some compensation expense, which makes sense given the good year we're having here. Can we read through maybe the accelerated line relocate stuff into next year? Or do you expect to wrap up most of the extra expense here in fiscal '13?
Bret J. Eckert: I think you're going to see -- there's a lot of construction going on in our service areas. And so the extent that, that continues to be driven we'll have those expenses. We are, with the warmer weather, getting ahead of some of that, that we can here in our third and fourth fiscal quarter. But that's a little bit more driven by development in the service areas we serve.
Kim R. Cocklin: Look, I mean, also I think it points out the fact that we're remaining to serve jurisdictions that have pretty healthy economies because your line locates is a definite indicator of economic activity, construction investment that's going on. So it's really a very, very positive sign for our jurisdictions in the economies, the health of the economies where our customers are situated, Spencer.
Operator: Ms. Giles, it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for further comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you and I just want to remind everyone that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through November 6. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us this morning. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - Vice President of Investor Relations Kim R. Cocklin - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Bret J. Eckert - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, VP, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you. Mrs. Giles, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Brenda. And good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to a few of the slides during this live call, and we'll be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later today. Joining me in this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions, if needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see Slide 2 for more information regarding the risks and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Susan. And good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported second quarter consolidated net income of $116 million or $1.27 per diluted share compared to $109 million or $1.20 per diluted share a year ago. And for the 6 months, reported earnings were $2.15 per share compared with $1.94 last year. On April 1, we closed the sale of about 64,000 meters in our distribution assets in Georgia for approximately $155 million. We will record an after-tax gain next quarter of approximately $6 million or $0.07 per diluted share, subject to final purchase price adjustments. The net proceeds are being reinvested in our regulated capital investment opportunities. This disposition, along with that of Missouri, Illinois and Iowa last year, delivers our commitment to become more geographically efficient and continues our focus on growing our remaining regulated rate base by 8% to 8.5% by the end of fiscal 2016. In February, we began publicizing the impact of the Mid-Tex rate case and the expectation for gas margins to shift from the first half of our fiscal year into the back half of this year. As we anticipated and communicated to you, the shift reduced results in the current quarter but will be more than offset with increased natural gas distribution margin in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. With 6 months of actual experience and the early arrival of returns from our growth through investment strategy, we have confidence that we can achieve the higher earnings range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share, up from our original guidance of $2.40 to $2.50, excluding the mark and the gain on the Georgia sale. Bret is going to provide more details on this development. Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared our 118th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '13 is $1.40 per share. For the 12 months ended March 31, our total return to shareholders stood at 41%. We stand committed to all stakeholders, providing growth in earnings while delivering an essential and safe service to our customers. Our CFO, Bret Eckert, will review our financial results in greater detail, and then I'll return with closing comments. And we'll address any questions you have. Bret?
Bret J. Eckert: Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. If you follow me on Slide 3. As Kim mentioned, reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 were $116 million or $1.27 per share compared with $109 million or $1.20 per share 1 year ago. Excluding unrealized margins, net income in the current quarter was $1.25 per diluted share versus $1.28 per diluted share last year, a decrease of $0.03 quarter-over-quarter. Turning now to Slide 4. For the 6 months ended March 31, reported earnings were $2.15 per share compared with $1.94 last year. After eliminating the unrealized gains in both years, earnings were $1.99 this year compared to $1.88 1 year ago, an increase of $0.11 per share or about 6%. We successfully completed the sale of our distribution assets in Georgia on April 1. However, the financial results for those assets on the income statement will continue to be reported as discontinued operations in the current quarter. Prior year results also include the discontinued operations of the Illinois, Iowa and Missouri service areas, which were sold in August 2012. Looking now on Slide 5 for the current quarter and 6-month periods. Distribution gross profit decreased by about $25 million in the quarter and about $29 million for the 6 months compared to the same periods 1 year ago. The decrease is a direct result to the shift in margins from the rate design changes in Texas. As expected and publicized, margin is down this quarter because of that shift, but higher margins will be achieved in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As noted on Slide 11, we expect margins from our Mid-Tex operations to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than historical results in each of the last 2 fiscal quarters of 2013, during periods of lower gas consumption. Additionally, as a result of the increase to the customer's monthly base charge and a decrease to the customer's consumption charge, 84% of our cost of service is recouped through the customer base charge compared to only 41% under the previous rate design, as shown on Slide 10. At the end of the day, the result is a more ratable distribution margins throughout the year while providing a more stabilized earnings stream going forward. Any seasonal impact from the weather is further diminished. Also in our distribution business, as detailed on Slide 12, we completed 11 regulatory proceedings fiscal year-to-date, which should result in about a $69 million increase in annual operating income. Turning to Slide 6. Our regulated intrastate pipeline and storage operations, Atmos Pipeline - Texas, generated almost $4 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter and $8 million in the current 6-month period. GRIP filings approved in fiscal 2012 accounted for virtually all of those increases. APT's consolidated throughput declined about 4% on the quarter and was about flat for the 6 months compared to the same periods 1 year ago, primarily from a producer's slower drilling program, which resulted in reduced production volumes of 130k MMBtu a day, down from originally planned volumes of 170k MMBtu a day. Turning now to our nonregulated operations, and you may want to turn to Slide 14. Realized margins increased $13 million quarter-over-quarter and almost $19 million for the 6-month period primarily due to increased asset optimization margins in both comparable periods. In the prior year periods, AEH took advantage of falling natural gas prices by injecting gas into storage to capture incremental physical to forward spread values that were subsequently realized during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. As a result, AEH realized significant losses on the settlement of those financial positions. In the current year period, AEH experienced significantly smaller realized losses from its asset optimization activities due to more favorable financial trading as market prices declined less in the current year period, against the execution strategy compared to the prior year period. Realized margins for gas delivery and related services increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and were flat for the 6-month comparison. Our nonregulated business has experienced a slight decline in consolidated sales volumes due to increased competition for the industrial customer. However, this impact was mitigated by higher per-unit gas delivery margins, reflecting colder weather in March that produced enhanced trading opportunities in the cash markets from price volatility. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. O&M is tracking as expected. For the quarter, it increased about $2 million but decreased by over $6 million in the current 6-month period. For the current 6 months, we experienced a decrease in legal and other administrative expenses, offset in part by an increase in contract labor from increased demand for locating gas lines in the DFW Metroplex and higher pipeline maintenance activities at APT. Interest charges were about $3 million lower this quarter and about $8 million lower for the current 6 months as a result of interest deferrals related to Texas infrastructure Rule 8.209 spending in both periods. Additionally, in the 6-month comparison, the early redemption of our 5 1/8% $250 million senior notes, with lower long-term debt, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 drove lower interest expense year-over-year. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2013. Based on continued strong earnings through our second fiscal quarter of 2013 from constructive rate outcomes, we are raising fiscal 2013 earnings guidance to $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share from $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share, excluding unrealized margins and the gain on the sale of the company's Georgia operations. Let me draw your attention to Slide 16 and 17 where we have updated our budget assumptions and provided net income projections by segment. We are increasing natural gas distribution net income to a new range of $147 million to $152 million. The regulated transmission and storage net income range remains at $68 million to $71 million, and the nonregulated business net income range remains at $9 million to $11 million for fiscal 2013. As a result, consolidated net income increases to a new range of $224 million to $234 million. Additional assumptions include the continued successful execution of our rate strategy. We continue to project operating income increases at the higher end of the previously announced range of $90 million to $110 million from approved rate outcomes in fiscal 2013, weighted average gas costs ranging from $4 to $6 per Mcf. In the nonregulated segment, we expect gross margin contribution to remain in the range of $56 million and $63 million, excluding any unrealized gains and losses. Projected delivered gas margins remain strong at $0.10 to $0.11 per Mcf, and delivered gas volumes remain in the 400 to 410 Bcf range. Our capital budget range has not changed and remains between $770 million and $790 million for fiscal 2013. We are optimistic that we can achieve our increased earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share and consolidated net income between $224 million and $234 million for fiscal 2013. Thank you for your time, and now I'll hand the call back to Kim.
Kim R. Cocklin: Thank you, Bret. Very well done. We've obviously had another very solid quarter and are very encouraged with the positive outlook for the remainder of fiscal '13. I do want to briefly comment on the retirement of Bob Best. As you know, Bob retired as the Executive Chairman of Atmos Energy on April 1. The company experienced tremendous growth during Bob's 16-year tenure, which included 7 acquisitions and growing the company from 660,000 to over 3 million regulated customers, also adding one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas as well as a very successful nonregulated marketing unit. Bob provided valuable leadership to the industry, serving as chair of the American Gas Association, the Southern Gas Association and also as a member of the National Energy Council. Many in the industry and more here at Atmos Energy are deeply grateful to Bob for his leadership, his coaching, his mentoring and his friendship. While we'll miss Bob on a day-to-day basis, he will remain engaged and a very important part of our company by continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board. We continue to successfully execute our rate strategy. As Bret said, we've completed 11 rate proceedings which, when combined with regulatory expense deferrals, result in an increase of about $87 million in annual operating income, which nearly reaches our commitment to deliver $90 million to $110 million of new revenue this year from rate outcomes. We currently have 4 cases pending with annual operating income request totaling more than $32 million. The largest of these is the 2012 APT GRIP filing in Texas requesting a $26.7 million increase. We expect the commission will act during its May 7 meeting and are hopeful that the rate adjustment will be reflected on the May 1 billing statements. We anticipate filing between another 8 to 10 more cases this fiscal year, requesting about $40 million of additional operating income increases. We continue to enjoy very positive relationships with our city customers in Texas and all of our other state regulators. With an annual investment in our regulated assets of some $800 million through 2016, we continue to demonstrate to the regulators and customers our commitment to safety and reliability. On our regulated Texas intrastate pipeline, we are investing capital to increase capacity, secure long-term gas supply and enhance the reliability of our service in certain critical locations on the Mid-Tex system. Capital expenses are GRIP-eligible and are provided the opportunity to earn a return on equity of 11.8%. The Line WX project is expected to be completed in December 2013 at a total cost of $113 million to $116 million and should improve service reliability to the areas west of the DFW Metroplex during peak service periods. Additionally, construction is underway for the installation of 2 1,500-horsepower solar turbine compressors designed to move gas to multiple interstate and intrastate pipelines in West Texas. The project will connect new supply being produced from the prolific Permian Basin shale plays to the APT system. Capital investment will range between $18 million and $20 million for this project, with an anticipated start date of June 2013. We also have a signed contract with a producer for 50 million a day, which essentially pays for the project. In our nonregulated operations, the focus remains on the delivered gas business to its approximate 1,000 customers. This has become a very lean and mean operation, and we continue to forecast the earnings contribution for this segment to be less than 5% of our annual consolidated income. On a consolidated basis, we remain committed to executing our capital plan of strategically spending close to $800 million annually through fiscal 2016 and growing our rate base at a compounded annual rate of between 8% and 8.5%, and earnings growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a compounded annual basis through 2016. Our commitment to increasing shareholder value will remain a top priority and will be pursued by continuing to focus on growing our earnings on a very consistent, predictable and reliable basis. We thank you for your time. And now we we'll open it up for your questions. Brenda?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay, it seems there are no questions over the phone line at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Brenda. Just one last thing: The -- a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through August 6. If you do have any additional questions, please call me or Rose all day long, we're here, or visit us at the upcoming AGA Financial Forum. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us this morning. Goodbye.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-02-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator Instructions).  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation.  Thank you. Ms. Giles, you may now begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone and thank you all for joining us.  This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts.  Its being webcast live over the Internet.  We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results.  We'll refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we'll be happy to take any questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link.  Additionally, we plan to file the company’s Form 10-Q later today. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO.  There are other members of our leadership team here as well to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.  Please see slide two for more information regarding the risk and uncertainties, we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin.  Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Susan, very much and good morning, everyone.  We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy and we are glad to be here to share some good news on our first quarter.  Yesterday, we did report first quarter consolidated net income of $80 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to $69 million or $0.75 per diluted share one year ago.  However, when you exclude the unrealized gains in both periods, net income was $67 million or $0.74 per share this quarter compared to $56 million or $0.61 last year, an increase of $0.13 quarter over quarter. Regulated operations has continued to deliver stable and predictable earnings for the enterprise, and recent rate design changes in Texas allow for a much more stabilized revenue stream with an increase to the customers monthly base charge and a decrease of the commodity charge.  And weather driven customer consumption continues to be even less important to us, and Bret is going to talk more about the impact of this rate design during his remarks. Our balance sheet remained very strong.  Our debt capitalization ratio is 53.5% at December 31 basically flat to last year.  And in January, you'll recall that we did issue $500 million of 30 year senior notes at 4.15%, which in effect replaced our $250 million senior notes, which were redeemed in August.  As a result, the weighted average cost of our long-term debt has improved 5.9% and average maturities have been extended from about 12 years to over 15 years. Also during the first quarter, we continue to optimize our credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity to fund our working capital needs.  We were able to reduce our costs and now have access to over $1 billion of working capital.  Our board of directors declared our 117th consecutive quarterly cash dividend and that indicated an annual dividend rate for fiscal '13 is a $1.40. Our CFO Bret Eckert will review our financial results in greater detail now and then we'll return for some closing comments and questions.  Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thanks, Kim and good morning everyone.  As Kim mentioned reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $80 million or $0.88 per share compared with $69 million or $0.75 one year ago.  When you eliminate the positive mark of $13 million or $0.14 per share, adjusted net income was $57 million or $0.74 per share compared with $56 million or $0.61 last year. As a reminder, because we executed an agreement in August 2012 to sell our distribution assets in Georgia, the financial results for those assets on the income statement are reported as discontinued operations in the current quarter.  The prior year result also includes the discontinued operations of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri service areas, which were sold in August 2012. In our Natural Gas Distribution business, we completed seven regulatory proceedings, which should result in about $64 million increase in annual operating income.  A portion of this rate increases began to materialize during the first quarter and we expect to see a more significant impact beginning in the second quarter of our fiscal year. In the current quarter, gross profit in our Natural Gas Distribution segment decreased $4 million mainly driven by rate design changes granted during the quarter in our Mid-Tex division.  Under the new rate design effective January 1, 2013, there was an increase in the monthly customer charge and a decrease in the consumption charge.  The current quarter was impacted as revenues recorded for December gas deliveries billed in January were calculated using the new rate that are effective for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2013.  We expect these decreases to be offset by increased margins in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 as I will address later on in my comments. Moving now to regulated transmission and storage, Atmos Pipeline Texas generated almost $4 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter.  GRIP filings approved in fiscal 2012 accounted for $3.7 million of the increase and the sale of excess retention gas increased gross profit by about $1 million.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand fees of about 600,000. Quarter-over-quarter, APT's consolidated throughput rose about 3.5% primarily from incremental, through system demand, from new delivery contracts with local producers. Turning now to our nonregulated operation, realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services were $14.6 million in the current quarter compared with $15.3 million one year ago.  The decrease primarily reflects a 7% decrease in consolidated sales volume largely due to warmer weather.  Gas delivery per unit margins were $0.10 per Mcf in both quarters. Asset optimization margins increased $6.5 million primarily due to smaller losses incurred from the settlement of financial positions, partially offset by higher storage demand fee.  Additionally, during the last year’s quarter, we took a $1.7 million charge to write down some natural gas inventory that no longer qualified for fair value hedge accounting. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement, operation and maintenance expense declined by $8 million quarter-over-quarter mainly due to establishing regulatory assets of about $3 million for pension and post retirement costs and regulatory costs at APT, a $3 million reduction in legal costs and a $1 million decrease due to increased capital spending in the current quarter. Interest charges were $5 million lower this quarter as a result of interest capitalized related to Texas Railroad Commission Rule 8.209 pending in the current quarter and the early redemption of our 5.125% $250 million senior notes due in January 2013, with funds borrowed under a $260 million short-term debt facility back in August 2012.  As Kim mentioned, we have been actively working to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile in a cost effective manner. We had a successful debt offering in January 2013.  There was strong demand for our 30 year paper with the offering oversubscribed threefold.  As a result, we were able to upsize the offering from $315 million to $500 million with the senior notes issued at 110 basis point credit spread and an effective yield and maturity of 4.636%. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the low interest rate environment and executed four staring interest rate swaps that effectively fix the treasury component of our planned issuances for debt expiring in fiscal years 2015 and 2017.  We also further optimized our credit facilities this quarter.  In December, we amended and upsized the $750 million credit facility to $950 million.  We terminated Atmos Energy Marketing's $200 million three year committed facility replacing it with $225 million 364 day bilateral credit facility and reduced our overall cost in the process. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2013, we expect fiscal 2013 earnings to be at the higher end of the previously announced range of $2.40 and $2.50 per diluted share excluding unrealized margins and the gain on the sale of the company's Georgia operations.  Due to constructive rate outcomes in a number of our jurisdictions partially offset by the acceleration and the anticipated timing of the sale of our Georgia operations into our third fiscal quarter. As mentioned earlier, you may want to turn to slide 16, rate design changes during the first quarter primarily related to our Mid-Tex operations resulted in an increase to the customer's monthly base charge and a decrease to the customer's consumption charge.  The amount adds to the commodity costs effective January 1, 2013. We believe these rates design changes will result in a more stabilized earning stream for our Mid-Tex operation on a go forward basis but will cause a shift in margins out of our first and second fiscal quarters and into our third and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to historical results resulting in a more ratable distribution of Mid-Tex margins throughout the year. As a result, we expect margins from our mid Mid-Tex operation to be approximately $20 million to $25 million less in our second fiscal quarter of 2013 offset by higher margin in the $25 million to $30 million range per quarter for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2013 during periods of lower consumption.  The ratable distribution of margins result from the new rate design at Mid-Tex, which now provides for approximately 84% of our cost to service being recouped due to customer base charge compared to approximately 40% under the previous rates design. Let me draw your attention to Slides 23 and 24, where we have outlined our budget assumptions and net income by segment.  These include continued successful execution of our rate strategy with projected operating income increases at the higher end of the previously announced range of between $90 million and $110 million from improved rate outcomes in fiscal 2013. Our original guidance assumed a full year contribution from the Georgia's discontinued operations in fiscal 2013.  However, the Georgia Commission is scheduled to rule on the transaction on February 19th, so closing could be accelerated into our third fiscal quarter.  Among other things, this depends on several factors including when back office functions can be assumed by the buyer and the integration work on both sides to be completed. In the Nonregulated segment, we expect gross margin contribution to now range between $56 million and $63 million excluding any unrealized gains and losses.  Projected delivery gas margins remained strong but due to warmer weather -- warmer weather experienced during the first fiscal quarter, we now expect delivery gas lines to be in the 400 to 410 Bcf range.  Additionally, we have rationalized the back office functions for our nonregulated operation consistent with our strategy to focus primarily on our nonregulated natural gas delivery. As a result, we expect operating and maintenance cost in the Nonregulated segment to be less than originally projected, which will help offset the reduction in nonregulated volumes.  Additionally, we are assuming the following in our guidance, normal weather for the remainder of the fiscal year; weighted average gas costs ranging from $4 to $6 per Mcf, average annual short-term interest rate of approximately 60 basis points and no material acquisition. Our capital budget range has not changed it remains between $770 million and $790 million for fiscal 2013.  We'll remain optimistic that we can achieve the higher end of the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share and our consolidated net income range between $220 million and $230 million for fiscal 2013 excluding unrealized margins and the gain on the sale of our Georgia operations. Thank you for your time and now I hand the call back to Kim.  Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much Bret for that good report.  We have reported a very solid start to fiscal 2013 and are encouraged with what we anticipate will be another good year.  So far during fiscal 13, we have completed several rate proceeding as Bret indicated, which when combined with regulatory expense deferrals result in an increase of about $78 million in annual operating income. These cases include results from several jurisdiction with the largest on in our mid Mid-Tex Division, where the Texas Railroad Commission issued a final order in early December authorizing a net increase to annual operating income of $42.6 million, which results from the rate increase of about $30 million spread out more ratably throughout the year, plus a decrease in depreciation rates of $13 million.  With the lower depreciation expense obviously we preserve rate base longer and there is a reduction of the customer bill. Also in Texas, our West Texas Division achieved the rate settlement, which was approved by the Railroad Commission for $6.6 million and we were also granted system wide rates in that case.  Like the Mid-Tex case, there was a shift between the consumption charge and the customer charge but to a lesser degree. New rates were reflected on customer bills beginning, October 1.  Currently, we have four cases pending requesting increases of about $8 million in other jurisdictions and we anticipate filing another 10 to 15 cases this fiscal period requesting increases totaling between $60 million and $70 million.  Slide 15 to 22 of our presentation provides more details on the rate case. On our Regulated Texas intrastate pipeline, we continue to invest capital to increase capacity, secure long-term gas supply and enhance the reliability of our service to Mid-Tex Division in certain necessary critical locations and those capital expenses are (inaudible) are GRIP eligible with the 11.8% return on equity granted to Atmos Pipeline Texas. The Line W Looping project was completed on schedule and on budget and from the time it went online we were moving gas and serving customers.  It's a 34-mile, 24-inch high pressure pipeline north of Fort Worth and is supported by a multiphase firm transportation agreement with the producer for delivery to the densely populated North Side Loop area through the year 2019.  The total project cost was $55 million and was placed in service in late December making these expenses eligible for the GRIP filing that we anticipate making this month.  The rates are designed on the straight fixed variable basis and consists of demand fees, which are expected to generate incremental annual revenue of between $10 million to $14 million, which began in January. The Line WX project is a 67-mile, 24-inch high pressure pipeline, which will improve service reliability during critical peak period with the current regulated customers of Atmos Pipeline Texas.  The first phase of that project is complete at a total cost of about $26 million and is also included in the upcoming GRIP file.  We expect Phases 2 and 3 to be complete in December 2013 at a total project cost of between $113 million and $116 million.  CapEx increased $10 million to accommodate a rerouting of about 8 miles of the original planned project. We're focused on executing our capital plan of strategically spending close to $800 million annually through 2016.  Safety is our top priority with the investments we're making.  While we can't control third-party damage to our facilities, we can control how we respond.  We have a team dedicated to pipeline safety.  We have a state-of-the-art training center at Gas City in Plano, Texas, where all employed gas operators and technicians think, practice, and train for the safest outcomes in routine and emergency situations. In fiscal 2013, we estimate that roughly 58% of our total CapEx outlay will be allocated to safety and compliance work on our system.  We are standing to fortify, strengthen, and enhance infrastructure to make our system even more safe and reliable. In our nonregulated operations the focus remains on the delivered gas service business providing value-added customer service on top of the delivery of gas is where this group excels with the 1000 customers that need energy management expertise.  Overall, we expect the contribution from the nonregulated business to be less than 5% of our annual earnings portfolio. Another bit of good news in January the Kentucky Court of Appeals recognized our position in the case arising out of the Park City gas gathering project and the associated royalties due from a third-party producer to landowners.  The court overturned a $28 million jury verdict, returned against us, and included that all of the claims we appealed should have been dismissed by the trial court as a matter of law.  The landowners and investor working interest owners made the discretionary review from the Supreme Court of Kentucky.  The decision of the Court of Appeals will not become final until that process is complete. On a consolidated basis, we believe our internal capital investment opportunities will facilitate rate based growth at a compounded annual rate of between 8% to 8.5% annually and generate earnings growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a compounded annual basis through fiscal 2016.  We stand committed to this growth, along with consistency and predictability to deliver dependable long-term financial success. Thank you very much for your time and now we'll open up the call for questions.  Rob?
Operator: Thank you.  (Operator Instructions).  Thank you.  Our first question today is from the line of Andy Bischof of Morningstar.  Please proceed with your question.
Andy Bischof: Just one question for you this morning, for [Robusta] refinancing opportunities you said $500 million and you're forwarding straight swaps, is there any other of Energy's see every time taking of that and roll those opportunities out there?
Kim Cocklin: Well, the few swaps we've put there on the 2015 issuances we've lost that and it's roughly 3.129% and the $250 million in the fiscal year '17 has been effectively fixed at 3.3668%.  Right now, we've only focused on putting our interest rate swaps on expiring issuances and feel comfortable with the positions we've taken there.
Operator: (Operator Instructions).  The next question is from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.  Please proceed with your question.
Amit Marwaha: It's Amit Marwaha filling in for Faisel.
Kim Cocklin: That other Faisel.
Amit Marwaha: Yeah, you got me Kim.  Just a quick question, good quarter.  Just wanted to get an idea with the adjustments with respect to the Mid-Tex rate case, could you give us a better idea on a percentage basis what the shaping of the EPS will look like throughout the year?
Kim Cocklin: Shaping?
Amit Marwaha: Yes, if you were to shape it, would you say that first half is going to be 60% of the overall -- represent 60% of the overall EPS?  So, could you give us an idea of how it might look?
Kim Cocklin: We've to look at it -- we could take a look.  I think the challenge we've is we're highlighting the change regarding Mid-Tex and obviously with the shift to the customer charge and ways from the commodity consumption charge it is going to make those earning more ratable.  We're going to be much, much reliant on the customer consumption fees.  But we'll not take a look at first we're going to improve that for the Mid-Tex customer that it serves, but across the rest of our jurisdictions, we'll have to take a look at how that plays out from our overall EPS standpoint.
Bret Eckert: Amit, I mean the overall increase is $42.6 million.
Amit Marwaha: Yeah, I'm with you there, I just want to get an idea.
Kim Cocklin: So, I mean, you've in your model, whatever you add for the total cost of service for Mid-Tex, about less than 40% of that was previously -- the previous rates were collected in the demand charge now about 84%.  If you add 42.6% to your model for revenues and adjust the recovery on a demand charge basis to 40% to 85%, 84% I mean the closest we can get is what Bret said I mean we're going to probably reduce revenues the reduction from last year about $25 million in quarter two, but that will increase by $25 million to $30 million in quarters three and four in the Mid-Tex division.  Susan can probably help you to model that.
Susan Giles: Yeah, I can maybe answer, absolutely.
Amit Marwaha: Second question.  I missed the details around the rate cases that you've filed to-date and what the backlog is sort of balance of the year?
Kim Cocklin: Well, right now we've got cases -- four cases standing or requesting increases of about $8 million and we're going to file another $10 million to $15 million bring in about, requesting $60 million to $70 million.  The lion's share I think if you look on $15 million to $22 million we've got GRIP filings in Texas for both Mid-Tex and the pipeline.  The pipeline will be filed this month about the middle of the month and then we anticipate filing a GRIP case for the Mid-Tex division around April 1. I mean overall, right now we've collected about $78 million or generated new revenue from rate outcomes plus REG asset treatment.  And we do expect to achieve the $90 million to $110 million estimate for rate outcomes that we've earlier had identified in assumptions for how we were going to get to the higher end of our earnings guidance range this year.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Ms. Giles, there are no further questions at the time.  I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Great.  Thank you, Rob.  I just want to remind everyone that there is a recording of this call available for replay on the website through May, the 2nd.  Again we appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us this morning.  Good bye.
Operator: Thank you.

===== 2012 Q4  (2012-11-08 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles – VP and Investor Relations Kim Cocklin – President & CEO
Analysts: Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs Amit Marwaha – Citigroup
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2012 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answers session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, VP and Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Giles, you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Brendon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to just a few of the slides during the live call, but we will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company’s Form 10-K next week. Our speakers today are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO and Bret Eckert, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Please see slide two for more affirmation regarding the risk and uncertainties we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on such risks and uncertainties. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Our thoughts do continue for all of those impacted by Sandy. We remain in contact with the affected utilities up in the northeast and stand ready when called to send people, equipment and supplies and anybody that was personally impacted, we certainly spend our continued thoughts and prayers for you during the recovery process. Yesterday, we were very pleased to report consolidated results, excluding the mark of $221.7 million or $2.42 per diluted share compared to results last year of $214.2 million or $2.34 per diluted share. When you add back the negative mark of $5 million or a negative nickel per share, reported consolidated net income was $217 million or $2.37 per diluted share for fiscal ‘12 compared to net income of $208 million or $2.27 per share a year ago. This represents the 10th consecutive year we’ve increased earnings per share and compares very favorably to our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.40, which also excluded unrealized gains and losses. Regulated operations have continued to increase its contribution of stable, predictable and reliable earnings for the enterprise, driven by a very focused and well executed rates and regulatory strategy. Rate relief for the distribution in Atmos Pipeline Texas combined generated about $47 million of incremental margin in fiscal ‘12. We did take advantage of the warmer than normal heating season and accelerated the start of many capital projects to fortify strengthen and/or replace our infrastructure to make our system even more safe and reliable. Also during the year, we closed on the sale of our distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to Liberty Energy and recorded an after-tax gain of about $6 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Additionally, during the year, we announced an agreement to sell our distribution assets in Georgia also to Liberty Energy for about $141 million. We estimate a $6 million after-tax gain on that sale and expect the transaction to close in late fiscal ‘13. Net proceeds from the sale will be redeployed to find beneficial capital projects in the remaining jurisdictions we serve. With these divestitures, we have become much more geographically efficient and do not anticipate any additional asset sales. Our non-regulated operations successfully executed their strategy of injecting gas in to storage in to the first half of fiscal year ‘12 and rolling financial positions to the third and fourth quarters and delivered overall positive results for the year. Our Board of Directors declared the 116th consecutive quarterly dividend and also raised the annual dividend by $0.02. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal ‘13 is $1.40 per share. The increase in the dividend reflects our continued support of providing an attractive return to our investors, while continuing to execute our growth strategy by re-investing capital in our system. Our shareholders experienced a 15% total return on their investment for the fiscal ‘12 year. Our liquidity, financial position and balance sheet remain very strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio of 51.7% at September 30 was unchanged from last year. On August 28, 2012, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5.125% senior notes due January ‘13 and on September 27 of ‘12, we entered into a $260 million term loan credit agreement to paydown the commercial paper sold in August from this early redemption. We plan to issue 350 million of new unsecured 30-year notes in January ‘13 and use those proceeds to repay the borrowings on this short-term facility. As a result of the sale of distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, as well as the future sales of Georgia assets, we updated our tax rate used to determine our deferred tax obligations and recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $13.6 million in the fourth quarter. We contributed cash of $10 million to a charitable donate, donor advised fund. This is our 501(c)3 not for profit fund in the custody of Vanguard. Our investment proceeds will be used by the company for future charitable giving, with respect to our defined benefit plans, we contributed $46.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans to achieve at 18% funding level. We contributed an additional $22 million to other post retirement benefit plans during fiscal 2012. The increase in funding is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate year-over-year. Coupled with lower plan asset valuations, when we established the funding requirement last January, and as a reminder, these expenses are typically recovered in general rate cases. We had a very busy and successful year financially and important leadership change transpired with the retirement Fred Meisenheimer Bret Eckert assumes the role of CFO at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Bret brings over 22 years of utility experience from his career in public accounting. We will certainly miss Fred, but are very fortunate to have Bret. Bret is going to review our consolidated financial results in greater detail. And I will return for closing comments, and then we’ll open up the call for questions. Bret?
Bret Eckert: Thanks, Kim. And good morning everyone. Since the quarter is really shoulder period for us. Our remarks will focus on a fiscal year and earnings guidance for fiscal 2013. As Kim mentioned, consolidated results for fiscal 2012, excluding realized margins with $221.7 million or $2.42 per diluted share. When you add that the negative market of $5 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Reported consolidated net income was $217 million or $2.37 per diluted share for fiscal 2012, compared to net income of $208 million of $2.27 per share one year ago. As expected, in our fiscal 2012 results was net gain on the sale of Missouri, Illinois and Iowa assets of $6.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Additionally, current year net income includes another $4 million or $0.04 per diluted share from the net positive impact of several one-time items. When comparing this year to last year, slide 3 shows that after eliminating the one-time items and the unrealized gains and losses in both years. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.30 for both periods. Drilling down into our regulated businesses and our distribution business, rate increases drove margin by about 18 million, with minimal impact on average customer bill. Consolidated distribution throughput decreased 8% this year, mainly due to lower consumption, primarily from warmer weather. With WNA mechanisms protecting about 94% of utility margins this past winter, we have largely mitigated the negative effect of a warm winter and in fact, we received over 15 million of WNA released to improve loss throughput. The Texas Intrastate Pipeline, Atmos Pipeline Texas experienced over a 28 million increase, primarily associated with the last GRIP program as well as an additional 18 million increase from the rate case effective in May of 2011. APT continued to experience an increase in its consolidated throughput, which was 7% higher in fiscal 2012. This increase is largely from incremental through system demand, resulting from the execution of new transportation agreements with local producers for deliveries to Fort Worth basin, Howard and Katy, albeit at lower transportation rights. Much of this increased throughput is gas being produced in association with crude oil wells. Turning now to our now regulated operations, you may want to turn to slide eight. Macroeconomic conditions continue to adversely affect results for companies in our industry with non-regulated gas marketing and trading operations. Additionally, we continued to experience compressed spot to forward spread values and basis differentials. That said, our realized non-regulated asset optimization margins increased 19.6 million in the current quarter and 2.8 million for the year from the trading strategy Kim mentioned. Realized delivered gas margins for the year decrease 12.4 million year-over-year due to a 9% decrease year-over-year in consolidated sales volumes, mainly due to less consumption by weather sensitive customers due to warmer weather and gas delivery per unit margins decreased $0.02 per Mcf, primarily due to lower basis differentials, resulting from increased natural gas supply and increased transportation costs. Realized asset optimization margins increased almost 3 million compared to the prior period, despite gas price volatility and compressed spot to forward spread value. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. As we stated previously, the mild weather allowed our crews to focus on capital projects. We did not encounter an adverse weather event like last year, which drives incremental O&M, the overtime and general expenses associated with such a weather event. This held true for both the distribution and regulated pipeline customers. Also, we implemented the regulatory asset treatment in Texas for our pension and post retirement liability, which allows us to defer the difference between our actual cost and what we currently recover in rates. These costs will become eligible for recovery and next way proceed. For the year we deferred about $4.3 million of pension and post-retirement expense. Partially offsetting these positives with an increase in depreciation and amortization of 6% or about $14 million for the current year due to an increase in sales and increase in net plan as a result of our ramped up capital spending. We go on administrative costs rose about $7 million year-over-year and employee related costs rolled over $3 million. After the impairment this year included $5.3 million non-cash charge to the period of the remaining investment in the gathering assets in Kentucky. The initial impairment of $11 million on these assets was recognized in fiscal 2011. Along with the $19.3 million impairment affords necessity. Miscellaneous expense in fiscal 2012 include the one-time $10 million cash donation to file the company’s charitable donor by fund, which can discuss the resulting in operating remarks. Fiscal 2011 included a $27.8 million pre-tax cash gain associated with unwinding two treasury loss agreements. Interest charges were about $10 million lower, primarily due to a maturing long-term debt being replaced at lower interest rates in fiscal 2011. Cover with reducing commitment fees in fiscal 2011 by decreasing the number of credit facilities and expanding the length of their term. And at the early reduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of the company filed in a $250 million senior note to January of 2013. Income tax expense decreased $8.6 million from last year. After recognizing a tax benefit of $13.6 million associated with producing a deferred tax rate used the calculated deferred tax obligation triggered by. the sale of Missouri, Illinois and Iowa distribution assets in August. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2013, we’ve announced our fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share and have updated and expect the contribution by business segment. This range excludes unrealized margin and the gain on the sale of Georgia operations. Let me draw your attention to slide 33 to 38, where we have outlined our budget assumptions and net income by segment for fiscal 2013. These include continued success to our execution of our rate strategy and collection effort, with projected operating income increases of about $90 to $110 million from approved rate outcomes in fiscal 2013. Guidance assumes a full-year contribution from the Georgia discontinued operation of $0.10 to $0.12 per share of fiscal 2013. The Georgia asset sales assume to close in late fiscal 2013. Expected gross margin contribution from the non-regualted segment in the range of 60 million to 67 million, excluding any unrealized gains and losses. Normal weather, weighted average gas costs ranging from $4 to $6 per Mcf. Average annual short-term interest rate of approximately 60 basis points and no material acquisition. We expect the regulated businesses to generate over 90% of total net income for fiscal 2013. The distribution segment is expected to achieve net income in the range of 143 million ot 148 million and the regulated pipeline in Texas should earn between 68 million and 71 million. Then non-regulated business is expected to generate net income in the 9 million to 11 million range in fiscal 2013. We anticipate delivered gas volumes of 425 to 435 Bcf at a per unit margin of $0.10 to $0.11. Our expectations for asset optimization margins continue to remain in the range of breakeven to 2 million. We expect asset optimization activities to at least offset the contract distorts demand sees again in fiscal 2013. We continue to shorten the overall lease terms for the contracted storage by entering into one-year terms for all renewals, for new contracts to better manage our storage costs. Our capital budget is projected to range between 770 million and 790 million for fiscal 2013, as we continue to focus on the safety, integrity and reliability of our infrastructure, while following various state approved programs. Thank you for your time and now, I’ll hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much for that report, Bret. We had an extremely solid year in ‘12 and increased earnings per share for the 10th consecutive year. And during fiscal ‘12, we did communicate our plans to invest significant capital in our regulated operations over a 5-year timeframe, ending fiscal 2016 to fortify, strengthen and/or replace our infrastructure to make our systems even more safe and reliable. Fiscal ‘12 was the first year of that 5-year plan and we invested approximately $723 million in our regulated operations. We’ll continue to finance this growth from internally generated cash flow and a combination of debt and equity. Our current plan assumes a net increase of 425 million in debt over that 5-year period. As a result of the various policies, encouraging investments by our regulators, we expect to increase our rate base from about 3.9 million – billion excuse me, at the beginning of fiscal ‘12 to between 5.7 billion and 5.9 billion by the end of fiscal ‘16, which equates to a compounded annual growth rate in rate base of 8% to 8.5% over that timeframe. The spending is significant because the enhanced value of the rate base is expected to generate earnings growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a compound annual basis through 2016. Overall, we have an exceptional portfolio of assets in very constructive business regulatory environments and have posted excellent relationships with regulators, who are tax but balancing the needs of consumers and businesses like Atmos provide essential utility services. Our rate treatment has improved steadily in all jurisdictions. In fiscal 2012, we receive great approvals to increased operating income by about $31 million. We will also allow to create asset deferrals of almost $10 million. This compares to range of between $90 to $110 million that’s expected to be approved in fiscal 2013, and an additional $20 to $25 million from assets deferrals in fiscal 2013. We currently have over $50 million of rate filings pending regulatory approval, the majority of this amount includes our $46.5 million Mid-Tex rate case pending in Texas. We anticipate of a proposed decision from the hearing next week with final commission action by December 20. We expect to seek over another $100 million and additional late filings in fiscal 2013 on behalf of our regulated distribution Atmos pipeline Texas operations. On a regulated Texas intrastate 8 pipeline, we continue to invest capital for increased capacity to secure new long-term gas supply on a firm reliable basis and also to enhance the reliability of our service and certain critical locations during peak periods along the Mid-Tex system, but aligned of a looping project and the line ex-project. In fiscal 2012, we spent $65 million on capital on these projects and we anticipate an additional $115 to $120 million of capital being spent to complete these projects. These capital expenses are GRIP eligible with an 11.8% return on equity. Looking forward our non-regulated business strategy will focus on growing margins and a challenging market and continue to provide value-added customer service. With the impairment of the remaining investment in the Part city and Shrewsbury gathering assets located in Kentucky. And a focus on managing business risks. We believe our non-regulated businesses will be successful in fiscal 2013 and beyond. Going forward, we will not expect or assume more than 10% of the consolidated earnings to be generated from this business. As we previously communicated, we have departed from our growth through acquisition strategy. We believe our internal capital investment opportunities will facilitate growth faster and with best risk than an acquisition. Therefore, we’re focused on the earnings growth potential from our accelerated rate base investment over the next four years and we’re shrewdly managing this level of spending. We recognize that growth along with consistency and predictability are important as we move into fiscal ‘13. We remain committed to delivering dependable long-term financial success. We certainly thank you for your time this morning and now, I’ll open it up for the questions. Brendon?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys. How are you doing?
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Ted. Pretty good. How are you doing?
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Surviving.
Kim Cocklin: Oh, you’re affected.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: I personally was not, but certainly everyone in the area was, so it’s been a little bit of a recovery. So we’re getting out of it though.
Kim Cocklin: Looks terrible from where we are seeing, Ted for sure.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. If we can just dwell a little bit more into the assumptions for the guidance in 2013 and really a certain broken record, but on the Mid-Tex stuff, is there anything you can give us in terms of you’ve asked for 46.5 million, kind of where are you coming out there, how are you reading the way this proposal for decision might come on next week? Kind of just any more color you can give us on the Mid-Tex side?
Kim Cocklin: We haven’t gotten any more information or color or anything on it, but it will be coming out, the hearing examiners first issue is decision and then we’re expecting by Christmas to have the commission action on it. So –
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. But you’ve got obviously a substance there on the 90 to 111, you’ve got your best guess on in terms of kind of where you’re going to come out on Mid-Tex and I guess the implementation then would be – would it be – if at all or would it be sort of if you get the final decision December 20, is that when you start to recognize the revenues?
Kim Cocklin: Any decision is only prospecting, so we’ll be communicating that information as soon as it’s available.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the divestitures quickly, you’ve obviously closed the sales previous and you’ve got the Georgia, I’m wondering if there’s any significant overhead savings we should be thinking about from those and I heard your comments around feeling like you have the right footprint now, so we should presume that there is probably not other sales of smaller utilities coming.
Kim Cocklin: No. No more sales were done in the eight remaining jurisdictions that we’re situated in. We think we’ve got a good footprint, we’ve got a excellent relations and we have very good economic conditions compared to the rest of the country and very good regulatory constructs in terms of significant overhead savings now.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then last one for me, there’s been commentary around the Barnett and maybe some volumes least stabilizing kind of feeling a little better about gas prices, some of the activity level, so I’m just wondering if you can comment on what you’re seeing in the Barnett, the producer interest and maybe if there is other more projects that would be GRIP eligible that you can see it on the path there?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, we can. The connected wellhead volumes are increasing and improving to our system and creating a lot of potential opportunities. Obviously, the ones that we have currently on the drawing board and are pursuing are as a result of increased deliveries that are coming on from associated gas plays and they continue to drill up that field and they’re moving out in the West Texas area towards the connection and we have opportunities out there. So it’s very, very good situation for Atmos Pipeline Texas and even a better situation for the Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions, who are going to continue to benefit from additional supply opportunities and diversity and competition to meet their needs, because we’re seeing continued growth in – on and around the metro area in DWF and certainly coast, where we serve the Austin area.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Kim Cocklin: Yeah. It’s – lot of sunshine ahead. Lot of hope and change for us.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. That’s it for me. Thanks, Kim.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Ted.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from (inaudible) of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: Hey, good morning, guys. It’s Amit Marwaha here. Let me –
Kim Cocklin: Amit, how are you?
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: I am all right, Kim. How are you making out?
Kim Cocklin: Pretty good, pretty good. Good to hear from you. Are you okay, everything – were you affected?
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: Yeah. I’m downtown.
Kim Cocklin: Oh gosh. I sort of figured.
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: Yeah. But I got swimming in –
Kim Cocklin: Oh, boy, that brings you back to your Austin and Canada days, I guess.
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: Oh, yeah, good memories, good memories. Just a quick question here on the non-regulated side continue just continued to see the volumes drifting off and the unit margins coming off, just wondering if there are any opportunity here some of smaller players, getting squeezed out of bit potentially pick up, I know this is non-core area for cross, is there potential here to pick up some incremental volumes from the smaller players and kind of how should we look at the run rate?
Kim Cocklin: Yeah.
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: Is there further deterioration. How should we think about margin going forward given kind of where the picked?
Kim Cocklin: We had really, really good results in the last quarter, from the non-regulated group and it was principally driven by obviously some of the positions drilling off, but more importantly, we saw an uptick in the average margin that they were collecting out there, and overall net that did increase customers for 2013 and their focus and their new business strategy obviously, is identifying, which exactly what you’re talking about. We need the quality in smaller customers and they were not chased in the bigger industrials, since the a lot of the producers are going after them and there’s a lot of energy managers that are involved in the middle of that, which cuts down on your margin. But their indicators particular last two months of our fiscal year. They succeeded and increasing the number of customers they have and increasing the average margin rate that they are collecting. So, yeah. I mean, you are exactly right and we do see a good opportunities for that group going forward, I think, we’ve got a positions exceptionally well. They are focusing on delivered gas sales strategy, and have always done exceptionally well and in customer survey, so, they have over 90% retention rate with the customers, they do business with, meaning that most of those customers signed up for one year at a time, and they’ve got 90% of have returned year after year. So, let’s review now, there’s some of that relationship a lot of value, they’re doing well. Continuing to focus and take the opportunity, when can’t went storage and transmission long transportation contracts roll off. They’re taking advantage of the market opportunities for lower prices and reducing so, and we again – we’re not. We do – we don’t have any more but not assuming any more than a 10% contribution, but we’re extremely comfortable and happy and we think that there are an important asset in our portfolio contributing at that level is very good.
Amit Marwaha – Citigroup: All right. Thanks for the color, Tim. Take it easy, guys.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Amit.
Operator: It seems there are no further questions at the time. I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Thank you, all. And as a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February, the 6th. If you have any additional questions, please call me. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining in it. Good bye.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-08-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Atmos Energy's Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Conference Call.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Susan Giles, VP, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation.  Thank you.  You may begin.
Susan Giles: Thank you, [Danielle].  Good morning, everyone and thank you all for joining us.  This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts.  It is being webcast live over the Internet.  We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results.  We will refer to just a few of the slides during this live call, but we will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks.  If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link.  Additionally, we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later this morning. Our speakers today are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President and CFO.  There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectation, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.  Please see slide two for more information regarding the assumptions and factors that we consider in making these forward-looking statements and where to go to get more information on our risk factors. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin.  Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Susan, and good morning everyone.  We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported third quarter consolidated net income of $31 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to a net loss of about $1 million or a negative $0.01 per share one year ago. Our Non-Regulated Operations executed on their strategy and delivered positive results this quarter.  I'll remind you that in the first half of our fiscal year our Non-Regulated Group took advantage of falling gas prices by buying and injecting gas into storage.  As a result, there were no realized storage withdrawal gains to offset realized losses taken when we settled the financial instruments used to hedge the natural gas purchases.  However, that strategy paid off in the fiscal third quarter. Realized asset optimization margin increased $18 million as the financial position settled as anticipated from the trading approach employed earlier this year.  For the current nine months, reported net income was $209 million or $2.28 per diluted share, compared to $206 million or $2.26 for the nine months last year. Last week, we also announced the closing of the sale of our distribution asset in Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa to Liberty Energy for approximately $129 million.  About 84,000 distribution meters were transferred.  We expect to record a net of tax gain on the sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal '12 of approximately $6 million or $0.06 per diluted share subject to final purchase price adjustments. The net proceeds of $129 million have been used to pay down commercial paper. We also announced, yesterday, an agreement to sell our Georgia utility assets to Liberty for approximately $141 million.  Included in that transaction are about 64,000 distribution meters and a rate base estimate of some $96 million.  We are estimating a $6 million after-tax gain on the sale and expect that transaction to close in fiscal '13. Net proceeds will be redeployed to help finance rate-based investment in our remaining jurisdiction. Our liquidity and financial position remained strong and we benefit from solid investment grade credit ratings.  Our debt-capital ratio is 50.7% at June 30, compared with 48.6% one year ago. On July 27, we issued a notice of full redemption of our $250 million, 5-1/8% senior notes which are due January 2013.  That redemption will occur on August 28, 2012.  We will initially utilize commercial paper to redeem the notes and shortly thereafter enter into a short-term financing facility to repay the commercial paper.  We will then issue new unsecured long-term notes probably in January 13 and use those proceeds to repay the borrowings on the short-term facility. Yesterday, our board of directors declared the 115th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.  The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '12 is $1.38. Fred Meisenheimer, our CFO, will review our financial results in greater detail and we'll come back for some closing comments and open the call up for questions.  Fred?
Fred Meisenheimer: Thanks Kim and good morning everyone.  I'll review the more significant items in the quarter and nine months and discuss the outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. As Kim mentioned, reported consolidated net income was $31 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the quarter, and $209 million or $2.28 per diluted share for the current nine months. If you'll turn to slide three, it compares quarters.  And when you exclude the unrealized gains, net income was $29 million or $0.32 this quarter, compared to a loss of about $1 million or $0.01 per share last year.  Last year's quarter has a one-time charge of $6 million or $0.06 per share. After eliminating both the one-time item and the unrealized net gains, net income was $0.05 per share last year versus $0.32 per diluted share at this quarter, an increase of $0.27 per share. When comparing the nine-months, slide 10 shows that after eliminating the one-time items last year and the unrealized gains and losses in both years, adjusted earnings per share were $2.20 for both periods. As a reminder, we combined and reported the financial results for Missouri, Illinois and Iowa on the income statement as discontinued operations for the periods presented.  Therefore, the corresponding detail by line item will be excluded from our comparative discussions. Let's drill down into our Regulated business. Rate relief remains a primary driver of our success in the regulated operations.  Rate increases for distribution at Atmos Pipeline -Texas combined generated almost $14 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter and about $48 million for the current nine months compared to the same period last year. Consolidated distribution throughput decreased 5% in the quarter and 9% for the nine months compared to the same periods last year, mainly due to lower consumption primarily from warm weather. With WNA mechanisms protecting about 94% of our utility margins, we've largely mitigated the negative effects of a warm winter and, in fact, we've received over $50 million of WNA relief to underpin the loss throughput. The Texas intrastate pipeline continued to experience an increase in its consolidated throughput, which was 5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 9% higher in the nine months.  This increase was primarily from incremental through system demand resulting from the execution of new transportation agreements with local producers to Howard and [Kaye], albeit at a lower transportation rates. Additionally, we saw electric generation load increase during the current quarter.  Low natural gas prices displaced part of the load that would normally be generated by coal plants. Turning now to our Non-Regulated Operations, you might want to turn to slides 8 and 15.  At a macro level, we anticipate natural gas storage levels will remain high, gas prices to remain relatively low with little volatility and spot to forward spread values and basis differentials to remain compressed.  Pressure on margins from weak natural gas market conditions is a resonating issue throughout the industry for those with non-regulated gas marketing and trading operations. That said, our realized non-regulated asset optimization margins increased $18 million in the current quarter from the trading strategy executed earlier this year.  As Kim mentioned our non-regulated group took advantage of falling gas prices by buying and injecting gas into storage and capturing incremental physical foreign spread values. This quarter we've realized an increase of $18 million of asset optimization margins as a result.  Of the $22 million of economic value at June 30, we expect to recognize about $18 million of that in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Realized delivered gas margins decreased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter and almost $12 million year-over-year due to, first, a 10% increase the quarter recorded primarily from lower industrial and power generation demand and a 7% decrease year-over-year in consolidated sales volumes mainly due to less consumption by weather sensitive customers due to warmer weather.  And second, gas delivery per unit margins were about flat at $0.11 in both quarters, but decreased from $0.14 per Mcf in the prior nine-month period to $0.11 per Mcf in current nine months, primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply and increases transportation costs. Realized asset optimization margins increased about $18 million quarter-over-quarter, as I mentioned, but for the current nine months asset optimization margin decreased $17 million as a result of flat gas market with little gas price volatility and compressed spot to forward spread values. Turning now to the expense side of the income statement.  As we stated last quarter, the mild weather allowed our crews to focus on capital projects which reduced O&M expenses by about $2 million for the quarter and $6 million for the current nine months compared to last year.  Also we implemented regulatory asset treatment in Texas for our pension and post-retirement bond holders which allows us to defer the difference between our actual cost and what we currently recover in rates.  These calls will become eligible for recovery in our next rate proceeding.  In the current quarter, we deferred about $1.4 million and $3 million of expense year-to-date. Partially offsetting these postures was an increase in depreciation and amortization in the quarter of about $3 million and $12 million from current nine months due to an increase in net plant as a result of our ramped up capital spending. Legal and other administrative costs decreased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter or rose over $2 million year-over-year primarily as a result of higher settlements and increased outside attorney's fees. Operating expense in our non-regulated operations decreased by about $11 million quarter-over-quarter and $36 million for the nine months primarily due to the absence of the current periods of asset impairment charges related to gas gathering assets for necessity that we recognized last year. Moving to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2012.  We have reaffirmed our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share and have updated the expected contribution by business segment.  This range assumes no mark-to-market impact at September 30, 2012, but does include the after-tax gain on the Liberty sale. Let me draw your attention to slides 36 through 40 where we've outlined our budget assumptions and earnings re-projections.  We expect the regulated businesses to generate over 90% of total net income for fiscal 2012.  The distribution segment is now expected to achieve net income in the range of $135 million to $139 million, and the regulated pipeline Texas should earn between $61 million and $65 million. We expect to record an after-tax gain of about $6 million or $0.06 per share on the sale of the distribution properties in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa.  These numbers are subject to final purchase price adjustments. The non-regulated business is re-projected to generate net income in the range of $14 million to $16 million.  We anticipate delivery gas volumes of 395 Bcf to 405 Bcf at a per unit rate of $0.09 to $0.11.  Our expectations for asset optimization margins continue to remain in the range of breakeven to $2 million.  For the near term, we're expecting asset optimization activities to at least offset the contracted storage demand phase. Keep in mind that the storage is essential for the 1,000 customers to which our AEH provides services such as distribution divisions, utilities and other regulated municipalities contracting for firm natural gas supply.  We're working to shorten the lease terms for the contracted storage to one year to better manage our storage cost. Our capital budget range remains between $690 million to $710 million for fiscal 2012. Year-to-date, we have contributed $56 million to our pension and postretirement plans.  The pension obligation is driven by both the reduction in the discount rate and a decline in the fair value of the plant assets compared to last year.  We expect to contribute an additional $11 million to $16 million to the plants before the end of the fiscal year.  And as a reminder, most of our pension and postretirement expenses are typically recoverable in general rate crisis in our jurisdictions. Thank you for your time, and I'll hand the call back over to Kim.  Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Fred.  We certainly had an unprecedented third quarter with sets us up well for delivering our stated earnings objective of $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share for fiscal '12.  Our business performs steadily year-to-date despite a very mild heating season and the economic obstacles that continue to challenge everyone in our nation. In our non-regulated business, the prolonged low gas price environment has entirely suppressed spread values and our asset optimization resource will be a very, very negligible contributor going forward.  The non-regulated marketing group will focus on its core business, which is delivered gas sales by increasing annual sales and improving margins particularly to those 1,000 customers who rely on and pay a premium for our bundled energy management services. Throughout the industry a paradigm shift has clearly emerged in the non-regulated gas marketing and trading operations.  While we're still trying to determine the new floor for our non-regulated business, we do expect less than 10% of consolidated earnings and revenues to be generated from this unit going forward. In our regulated operations, we continue to execute our rate strategy to reduce lag, improve returns and increase recovery of fixed cost.  Fiscal year-to-date, we have received increases to operating income of about $37 million from rate outcomes.  In total, we have about $70 million in rate request currently outstanding and pending and anticipate filing a case in Mississippi before the end of our fiscal year in September.  Investing in our regulated asset base will provide the avenue for growth in the coming years. At Atmos Pipeline Texas, our intrastate pipeline we're investing significant capital to increase capacity to secure new long-term gas supply on a firm reliable basis, and also to enhance the reliability of our service in certain critical locations along the mid-Tex system with our Line W Looping Project and the Line X project.  Total capital for these is expected to range between $160 million and $170 million, and these capital expenses are DRIP eligible with obviously the 11.8% return on equity awarded to the pipeline. As we previously discussed, we're targeting significant capital investment over the next five years to fortify, strengthen and replace our infrastructure. The Kentucky Pipeline Replacement Program encourages capital spending related to safety by allowing carrying cost and return to be collected in advance through a customer surcharge.  Coupled with similar projects in Georgia and Kansas, we expect to spend almost $40 million of capital in these three states in fiscal '12. In Texas, Rule 8.209 is a risk-based program that encourages spending for system safety and reliability.  The program is reviewed in advance and received regulatory asset treatment for carrying costs.  We expect Rule 8 spending to be about $100 million in fiscal '12 and increase rapidly to more than double by fiscal 2016. Also in Texas, the steel service line replacement program is a risk-based program with a carrying cost and return are collected in advance of the spend through a customer surcharge.  By the end of September, we will have replaced 100,000 steel service lines in the Mid-Tex division.  That program is set to expire September 30, 2012, and we expect to have spent almost $70 million by that time. We also expect to spend over $200 million on enhanced infrastructure replacement programs in fiscal '12 compared to about $65 million spent on similar programs last year.  And over the five years we expect this type of spending to grow at a compounded annual rate of about 27%. We plan to increase our regulated rate base from about $4 billion at the beginning of fiscal '12 to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion by the end of fiscal 2016 which equates to a compounded annual growth rate in rate base of 8% to 8.5% over that timeframe. The enhanced value of the rate base is expected to generate earnings growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a compounded annual basis by 2016. We will focus on the earnings growth potential from our accelerated rate base investment over the next five years and, as always, we do remain committed to delivering dependable, consistent, long-term financial success. We very much appreciate your time this morning and we'll now open it up for questions.  Danielle?
Operator: (Operator Instructions).  Our first question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs & Company.  Please proceed with your question.
Ted Durbin: Just starting off with the sale, the Georgia sale, I guess, maybe can you back up and talk about what's the end game here in terms of how many jurisdictions you want to be in?  What comes into the decision-making process in terms of exiting a certain jurisdiction, is it scale, is it the returns, some of the underlying growth, maybe just walk us through the overall vision here?
Kim Cocklin: I think the overriding driver obviously is first interest or an appetite from a prospective buyer in that marketplace and, more importantly, it has to be focused in a jurisdiction where we really are growth constrained and that was the real -- I mean, now that we have exited Missouri, Illinois and Iowa.  And Georgia, we were obviously kind of fenced in by AGL there.  We didn't have a lot of growth prospects. Georgia is a very, very good jurisdiction.  We had received very favorable regulatory treatment there.  We had very good relations and we have good investments, and we were of course completing the replacement of all pipes down there. So long-term, we just looked at it as probably some place that we're going to be constrained going forward, and we felt that we had much better opportunities to take proceeds from an attractive offer and redeploy them into our remaining jurisdictions where we do have an opportunity to expand our footprint very significantly.  And we're also getting extremely favorable rate treatment, regulatory treatment with the reduction in lag on particularly on infrastructure investment.  So, I think where we're at on the end-game, I mean, I think we're very happy with where we're situated right now.
Ted Durbin: Next one from me is we're coming up on the time here, I think, you've traditionally have increased the dividend.  How are you thinking about the payout ratio?  You mentioned in your comments you're reducing some of the non-regulated business impact on the earnings you're getting there as you just said lot more of the automatic trackers, how are you thinking about the dividend and payout?
Fred Meisenheimer: Well, the dividend policy hasn't changed.  I mean, we still think our highest and best use for capital and the most value of the shareholder is investing in the rate base in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia where we are situated right now and because of that rate treatment we are getting very favorable treatment and good returns.  So we think -- the dividend policy we obviously have increased our dividend every year for the last 28 years or whatever and we are added to the S&P 1500 dividend Aristocrat, identified as one of those for increasing it every year for 20 years.  We don't want -- we don’t want to break that track record for sure.
Ted Durbin: And then, the last one for me is just kind of update you can give us on the mid-Tex filing here.  Are you getting any closer to any kind of settlement?  How are the negotiations going?  Are we still thinking this is going to be a fully litigated case, and kind of update on timing of decision?
Fred Meisenheimer: We do assume that it'd probably be a fully litigated case.  I mean, the parties that -- I mean, there is good relations going on but I think both sides have reached a position where there is quite a gap between the expectations on both sides and is situation in front of the commission right now.  We do expect an outcome and a decision in the November, December timeframe of --  that will be in the fiscal '13 period as we continue to talk about.
Operator: Now, our next question comes from Andrew Bischof of Morningstar.
Andrew Bischof: Looking at your Atmos Energy Holdings, you've been very successful there in your optimization strategy.  Am I correct in assuming or understanding that there is a minimum amount of additional benefit in the future quarters from that?
Kim Cocklin: Yes.
Andrew Bischof: And then looking at your --
Fred Meisenheimer: In the fourth quarter, we will realize about $18 million that will come in as realized.  And then after that point in time we have about $22 million of economic value at June 30, $18 million of which roughly will be recognized in the fourth quarter.  So, that leaves very little for the following year at this point in time.
Andrew Bischof: And looking to the sale of the Georgia distribution assets, in terms of O&M, can you kind of break that out for us?
Fred Meisenheimer: O&M?  What kind of breakdown are you wanting on O&M there?
Andrew Bischof: Just how much is related to that business and when you'll expect that transaction to close?
Fred Meisenheimer: We expect it to close in fiscal 2013.  The direct operating O&M on Georgia runs in the neighborhood of $16 million to $17 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.  Please proceed with your question. Amit Marwaha - Citigroup It's actually Amit filling in for Faisel.
Kim Cocklin: Amit, you got to be happy about geographic efficiency then.
Amit Marwaha: Yeah, a good deal, good deal.  Good quarter guys.  Most of my questions have been asked.  I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions.  Are you guys seeing any pressures on the ROEs at this point across any of your jurisdictions given where rates are?
Kim Cocklin: No, none whatsoever.  We -- obviously there's a -- the outstanding mark in fact is with the cases there.  But we think that the elections that occurred in the -- the folks that were elected to the Labor Commission continue to believe that the road to a healthy economy is through energy and Texas leads the way on that road.  And they are very, very balanced in their approach between the utility and the consumer.
Amit Marwaha: Second question, just wondering the last couple of quarters been seen industrial volumes coming off.  I'm wondering if you guys have any color around what's driving that?  Is it the weather or what's exactly causing those volumes to kind of shed each quarter over the last couple of quarters?
Fred Meisenheimer: I think more of that has been weather related here recently and the economy still is not picking up dramatically.  But I think the warm weather has impacted it more than anything else somewhat offset by the volumes we've been delivering to the power generation too, Amit, but that's really not a big driver in the overall scheme of our revenue structure.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Now, our next question comes from Jeff Healy of AIG.  Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Healy: I had a question on the takeout of the '13, I guess, you guys have done a bridge from the September to January.  Any particular reason why you guys would do that as opposed to just hit the long-term market in September?
Fred Meisenheimer: It will reduce our interest cost both this year and next year.  We see some benefits in doing that.
Jeff Healy: Fred, particularly I just want to say kind of on behalf of all the bondholders and sure other folks (inaudible), but you guys have a great reputation for disclosure and really making things easy for us on the bondholder side.  I want to express our appreciation.  Thanks for a job, great job well done.
Fred Meisenheimer: Well, good.  We appreciate your interest and hope that we can continue to provide useful information to you.
Operator: Thank you.  There are no further questions in the queue at this time.  I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Giles.
Susan Giles: Thank you, Danielle.  And as a reminder, a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through November 7th.  And if you have any additional questions, please call me.  We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us today.  Good bye.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-05-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Susan Giles, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you. Ms. Giles, you may begin. 
Susan Giles: Thank you, Claudia, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to just a few of the slides during the call, but we will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks.
 If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the Conference Call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later today.
 Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President and CEO; and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions, as needed.
 As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim? 
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we recorded second quarter consolidated net income of $109 million or $1.20 per diluted share compared to $132 million or $1.45 per share one year ago. When you exclude the unrealized losses, net income was $117 million or $1.28 this quarter compared to $134 million or $1.47 last year. Last year's quarter had onetime items totaling $11 million or $0.12 per share. After eliminating both the onetime items and the unrealized net losses, net income was $1.35 per share last year versus the $1.28 per diluted share in the current quarter. 
 For the first 6 months of last year, recorded earnings were $2.26 per share compared with $1.94 this year. Again, after eliminating the onetime items last year and the unrealized gains and losses in both years, adjusted earnings were $1.88 this year compared to $2.16 a year ago. 
 Our liquidity and financial position remains very strong. We have healthy credit ratings. Our debt capital ratio was 50.2% at March 31 compared to 47.6% one year ago. We've contributed over $40 million to our employee pension and retirement plan to date this year to attain an 80% funding target for the pension plan. Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared the 114th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal '12 is $1.38. 
 Our CFO, Fred Meisenheimer, will review our financial results in greater detail now, and will return for closing comments and open the call up for any questions. Fred? 
Fred Meisenheimer: Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, because of the agreement to sell our distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, we combined and report the financial results for those assets on the net income statement as discontinued operations for the periods presented. Therefore, the corresponding detail of our line item will be excluded from my comparative discussions. 
 Rate relief remains the primary driver of our success in the regulated operations. Rate increases for distribution and Atmos pipeline, Texas combined generated almost $15 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter and about $28 million for the 6 months compared to the same period last year. 
 Weather for the second quarter was 27% warmer than normal and 17% warmer than normal for the 6 months across our distribution service area. However, with WNA mechanisms protecting about 94% of our operating margins, we have largely mitigated the negative effects of a warm winter like we experienced this year. Despite of a period-over-period 10% decline in consolidated throughput at the utilities, the overall negative revenue impact of warmer weather this past 6 months, after adjusting for WNA, was just $2.9 million. 
 In spite of the warm weather that caused deliveries to the Mid-Tex utility customers to decline, the Texas intrastate pipeline continued to experience an increase in its consolidated throughput, which was 17% higher quarter-over-quarter and 11% higher year-to-date. This increase is primarily from incremental through-system demand resulting from the execution of new delivery contracts with local producers, albeit at lower transportation rates. Much of this increased throughput is gas being produced in association with crude oil wells. 
 Turning now to the expense side of the income statement. The silver lining to all this warm weather this winter, in addition to having WNA, was that our crews were able to focus on capital projects, thereby reducing O&M expenses by about $1 million for the quarter and about $4 million for the 6 months compared to the same periods last year. Additionally, in the current quarter, we implemented regulatory asset treatment in Texas for our pension and postretirement liabilities, which allows us to defer the difference between our actual cost and what we’re currently recovering in rates. These costs will become eligible for recovery in our next rate proceeding. In the current quarter, we deferred about $1.5 million of expense, and we expect to defer about $4 million of expense by the end of the fiscal year. 
 Partially offsetting these positives was a rise in legal cost. As we discussed on our first quarter call, these increases are primarily due to higher settlements and overall higher outside attorneys’ fees at the utility. And the Texas intrastate pipeline experienced pipeline integrity spending that is running slightly up ahead of last year, about $1.8 million year-to-date and $500,000 quarter-over-quarter. 
 Turning now to our nonregulated operations, and you might want to turn to Slides 8 and 15. The ongoing and unfavorable natural gas market conditions continue to pressure this segment, though we anticipate natural gas storage levels will remain high for an extended period of time, gas prices to remain relatively low with little volatility and spot the forward spread values of basis differentials to remain compressed. As a result, while we anticipate continuing to profit from our nonregulated activities on a fiscal year basis, we expect per-unit margins from our delivered gas activities and margins earned from our asset optimization activities will be lower than in previous years. 
 Realized delivered gas margins decreased about $5 million quarter-over-quarter and almost $10 million year-over-year due to a 7% decrease for the quarter and a 6% decrease year-over-year in consolidated sales volumes, mainly due to less consumption by weather-sensitive customers due to the warm weather; and a decrease in gas delivery per-unit margins from $0.15 per Mcf in the prior year quarter to $0.13 per Mcf in the current year quarter; and from $0.15 per Mcf in the prior 6 months to $0.12 per Mcf in the current 6 months, primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply. 
 Realized asset optimization margins decreased about $9 million from the prior year quarter and almost $30 million from the prior 6-month period. In both the current quarter and the 6-month period, AEH took advantage of falling natural gas prices by purchasing and injecting into storage a net 9 Bcf for the quarter and a net 25 Bcf for the 6 months, and capturing incremental fiscal-forward spread values that should be realized primarily in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. As a result of this decision and falling prices, we’ve realized significantly higher losses on the settlement of financial instruments used to hedge these natural gas purchases. 
 Unlike the regulated segments, operating expense is tracking below last year. Excluding the $19 million non-cash asset impairment charge recorded in last year's second quarter, operating expense is down $6 million year-over-year. The decrease is primarily due to the capitalization of labor related to the development and implementation of a new energy, trading and risk management system and lower legal fees related to litigation in the nonregulated business. 
 Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2012. We have reaffirmed our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share and have updated the expected contribution by business segment. This range assumes no mark-to-market impact at September 30, 2012. 
 Let me draw your attention to Slides 32 through 38, where we have outlined our budget assumptions and earnings re-projections. We expect the regulated businesses to generate over 90% of total net income for fiscal 2012. The distribution segment is now expected to achieve net income in a range of $134 million to $138 million and the regulated pipeline in Texas to earn between $59 million and $62 million. 
 The nonregulated business is reprojected to generate net income in the range of $17 million to $20 million. As a result of the continuing challenges of high natural gas storage levels and the unseasonably warm weather, we re-project nonregulated delivered gas and storage and transportation margins to range between $57 million to $62 million. We also now anticipate delivered gas volumes of 420 Bcf to 430 Bcf at a per-unit rate of $0.09 to $0.10. Our expectations for asset optimization margins continue to remain in the range of breakeven to $2 million. 
 For the near term, we are expecting asset optimization activities to at least offset the contracted storage land fees. Keep in mind, however, that storage is essential for the over 1,000 customers to which ADH provides services, such as our distribution divisions, utilities and other regulated municipalities contracted for firm natural gas supply. We are working to shorten the lease terms for the contracted storage to one year to better manage our cost. 
 Original earnings projection assumes a $5 million pretax gain on the sale of the distribution properties in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. As we have continued to refine the investment in those assets that we'll transfer to the purchaser, we now anticipate a pretax gain of approximately $10 million. And as we have already discussed, the unseasonably warm weather this past quarter enabled us to accelerate our capital spending and slow the O&M run rate. As a result, we're now projecting a $5 million reduction in the O&M expense to a range of $460 million to $470 million for the full fiscal year. Our capital budget was increased by $50 million last quarter and another $10 million this quarter, which sets the new range of between $690 million to $710 million for fiscal 2012. The increased capital spending will primarily be at the Texas intrastate pipeline on our 2 previously announced infrastructure projects. 
 We are also increasing our operating cash flow projection by $40 million this quarter to a range of $550 million to $570 million. Driven by the warm weather, we cycled less gas from storage, make fewer gas purchases to replenish the storage withdrawals and the gas purchases that were made were made at reduced prices. 
 As Kim mentioned, we contributed $43.3 million to our pension and postretirement plans. The pension obligation was driven by both a reduction in the discount rate and a decline in the fair value of plan assets compared to the last year. We expect to contribute an additional $23 million to $28 million to the plans before September 15, 2012. 
 Thank you for your time. And now, I'll hand the call back over to Kim. Kim? 
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Fred, for that very thorough and excellent report. Obviously, while the weather has been anything but cooperative for winter service, it has created excellent conditions to jump start our strategy to grow the company by investing in our regulated asset base. 
 As we have previously discussed, we're targeting significant capital investment over the next 5 years to fortify, strengthen and/or replace our infrastructure to make our system even safer and our service even more reliable, all while spurring economic growth and jobs in our service territory. 
 As a result of the various policy pronouncements encouraging investment, we expect to increase our rate base from about $4 billion at the beginning of the current fiscal year to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion by the end of fiscal 2016, which equates to a compounded annual growth rate in rate base of 8% to 8.5% over that timeframe. You can find the details on the Slides 42 to 45 in the appendix of the slide deck. We do plan to finance this growth from internally generated cash flow and a combination of debt and equity. 
 Our current plan assumes a net $200 million increase in debt over that period. Additionally, an equity issue may be necessary in the out years to optimize the debt-to-equity balance for rate-making purposes. Despite the slight dilution from issuing equity, the enhanced value of the rate base is expected to generate earnings growth in the range of 6% to 8% on a compounded annual basis by 2016. 
 As we announced last quarter, we have begun investing significant capital in our Texas intrastate pipeline system to increase its capacity to secure new long-term gas supply on a firm, reliable basis and also to enhance the reliability of our service in certain critical locations along the Mid-Tex system. The Line W looping project is designed to secure new long-term gas supply for the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and will require capital of between $47 million and $52 million. 
 Also, during fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2014, we will spend between $110 million, $120 million in capital on the Texas intrastate pipeline to construct Line X, which will improve service reliability for our regulated customers. These capital expenses are GRIP eligible with an 11.8% return on equity, and these projects improve the reliability of our pipeline system for all the customers that we serve. 
 Moving to the distribution business. In Texas, we do have a risk-based program that encourages spending for system safety and reliability pursuant to Rule 8.209. Projects under Rule 8.209 are approved in advance, and the rule allows regulatory asset treatment for the carrying costs. We expect Rule 8 spending to be about $100 million in fiscal '12 and increase to more than $200 million by fiscal 2016. 
 Also in Texas, we have the steel service line replacement program, which is expected to be completed by the end of September. This is also a risk-based program, where the carrying cost and return are collected in advance of the spend by way of a customer surcharge. This program is set to expire at the end of this fiscal year, September 30, 2012, and we expect to have spent almost $70 million during that period in fiscal '12. 
 The Kentucky pipeline replacement program also encourages capital spending related to safety by allowing carrying cost and return to be collected in advance by way of a customer surcharge. This program is expected to run for 10 to 15 years. And coupled with similar projects in Georgia and Kansas, we expect to spend almost $40 million of capital is these 3 states in fiscal 2012. 
 All told, we anticipate spending over $200 million on enhanced infrastructure replacement programs this fiscal year compared to about $65 million spent on similar programs last year. And over the 5 years, we expect this type of spending to grow at a compounded annual rate of about 27%. 
 We continue to execute our rate strategy to reduce lag, improve return on equities and increase the recovery of fixed cost. Fiscal year-to-date, we have received operating income increases of about $23 million from rate outcomes. In total, we have almost $70 million in rate requests pending and anticipate filing another 5 to 7 cases this fiscal year requesting between $10 million and $15 million of incremental operating income increases. 
 We anticipate closing the sale of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa distribution assets by July 1. Final approval by Illinois is pending, and all other requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. Our transition team communicates weekly with the purchaser, which is Liberty, to ensure that a smooth transfer of these assets will occur. Cash proceeds from the sale will be redeployed into the rate base investment opportunities that we've identified. 
 The nonregulated marketing group will continue to focus on its delivered gas sales business and its track record for excellent customer service. Growth for this business is difficult given current market conditions, but we intend to continue to focus on decreasing annual sales and improving margins, and we'll be realistic by expecting less than 10% of the consolidated earnings to be generated from this unit. 
 Our company has long emphasized a growth-through-acquisition strategy. We're clearly departing from that strategy, at least for the foreseeable future. We believe the internal capital investment opportunity that we just described and talked about will facilitate growth faster and with less risk than an acquisition in the current market environment. Low natural gas prices are reducing the total customer bill, creating headroom for tariffs supporting these infrastructure investments. All constituents win under these circumstances: our shareholders, our customers, our communities and the regulators. Therefore, we'll focus on the earnings growth potential from our accelerated rate base investment over the next 5 years. We remain committed to growing our assets and delivering consistent long-term financial success. 
 We thank you for your time this morning. We will now open up for the questions now. Claudia? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. 
Theodore Durbin: I guess I'm trying to understand, for this 8.209, is -- what's the ROE that you'll book on that? Is that tied to what you'll get in the Mid-Tex case that you're currently in? 
Kim Cocklin: Yes. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Yes. 
Kim Cocklin: It's at West Texas. 
Theodore Durbin: So for both West Texas and Mid-Tex. Okay. 
Kim Cocklin: Yes. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Yes. 
Theodore Durbin: Okay. So until you get a decision on that, you'll book it at your historical ROE. And then whatever that decision is, you'll then implement that? 
Kim Cocklin: Right. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Right. 
Theodore Durbin: So maybe just update us on where are you on Mid-Tex, the $46 million ask. What should we you think about in terms of timing? How are the negotiations going with the cities, et cetera? 
Kim Cocklin: Well, the negotiations are going fairly well. There seems to be -- continue to be a lot of discussion. At this point in time, it doesn't appear that we're headed for a settlement in the short term. We're continuing to anticipate that, that case may go before the commission and be heard. And that's really what -- we hope to settle it, and -- but we're not -- I mean, at this point it's hard to handicap it, Ted. We do -- we were -- we're planning as if we're not going to have an outcome probably until the fiscal 2013 period. 
Theodore Durbin: Yes. And I think that, yes, you had made that pretty clear, that you had not really put anything in guidance for that, so okay. And then just shifting over to the -- on the Texas pipeline side, I guess I'm wondering what's the nature of all the spending you'll be doing. Are these -- is this new build pipeline or just sort of fortifying the [indiscernible]. Part of the reason I ask is we -- I keep hearing that we're well piped in Texas; you have low basis differentials. You have energy transfers, talking about converting some gas pipelines to liquids. I'm just trying to understand the need for the pipeline spending in Texas. 
Kim Cocklin: Well, the need for the pipeline -- obviously, the Line W that is going in right now and that we'll expect to be in service by the end of this fiscal period is supported by an 8-year contract with EOG. And they've already -- essentially, that's a demand charge-based contract. It's in -- it involved with what we understand to be wet gas that they're drilling up right now, and there's not enough capacity coming out of that Monte County area. So that -- I mean, we've already -- we've essentially -- that firm contract is to back up the investment there. And then the other project, the Line X, is really the southern part of the system, and it is really just fortifying the price that we have down there and improving the system reliability. We experienced some weak spots on that system during the cold snap that occurred last winter, and as a consequence, it was identified by the engineers as necessary to be bolstered up. And so that is going to be a GRIP-eligible project, and it's really being utilized to serve the needs of the regulated customers that are on their -- serviced by the pipeline itself. So neither one of those projects are at risk in terms of being forced to have competition from whatever you're -- whatever other discussion you're hearing about. 
Theodore Durbin: Yes. That's fair. I guess I'm maybe thinking about beyond the 2 announced projects. It looks like it's $100 million to $200 million and maybe $150 million in the rest -- sort of '13 through '16. Kind of how are you envisioning that -- those type of projects? 
Fred Meisenheimer: That's all, Ted, is infrastructure improvements, which we're getting a lot of support from the regulators and various people to do that because of the events that have occurred in the past few years, San Bruno, et cetera. And I think both the company and new regulators see this as a good time to spend this type money to make these infrastructure improvements while gas prices are very low. It has minimal impact, if any, on the customer base. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research. 
Mark Barnett: I guess I'm just wondering, you obviously had some weather impact so far in the year and the quarter. I guess outside of the weather-related consumption changes, can you talk about some of the economic factors that you're seeing in your results thus far? I'm seeing a little bit of a tick-up in your bad debt. Are there any large accounts driving it? Or is it more kind of across the system? 
Fred Meisenheimer: No, I -- bad debts, we believe, are in excellent condition. Our provision is roughly 3/10 of 1%. Our net write-offs year-to-date are $200,000 on utility. And so we believe our allowance account is very adequate, and our bad debt situation is well in hand. It is something we have a lot of people focused on, working on, dedicated to. And for the past several years, our bad debt experience has been very, very low. 
Kim Cocklin: And then you might comment on weather normalization. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Yes, weather normalization. Had we not had weather normalization, we would have had an impact of about $47 million from weather. But with the weather normalization, our impact was $2.9 million. So our WNA worked very, very well for us. There are a few states where we do not have WNA. Colorado being the one that we don't have it and that we will be retaining. The others where we don't have it are those 3 states that we're disposing of. So our WNA has worked extremely well for us. 
Kim Cocklin: Yes. I mean, it's been quite the opposite of what you described, because obviously, the weather has dampened the price of gas, and obviously, that has reduced the exposure on the uncollectible side of the business. But we've got also adequate coverage on the recovery of the gas cost portion of bad debt in a lot of our jurisdictions, so that risk has been minimized and been an excellent job. And again, if there was ever a test for WNA, it was this year. And the silver lining, obviously, is that it has worked very beautifully along with the rest of the rate strategy that we’ve deployed over the last 5 years. And the biggest bonus is that we've had the opportunity to have a construction season for about the last 14 months going, and we've taken full advantage of that to continue to ramp up the investment in the regulated assets and get ahead of the curve on this infrastructure fortification and replacement. I mean, the regulators are -- they're doing a lot of things to incentivize and motivate the utilities right now to get out in front and to avoid any kind of infrastructure upset like you saw in Minnesota with bridges or even -- obviously, no one wants another San Bruno. And we're doing a lot on that side and you’re seeing some very, very good results in terms of the statistics that we're seeing for leak detection, leak results and the safety outcomes. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Yes. And also, in addition to that, the industrial demand that we have seen this year compared to last year on a consolidated basis is up 2% over last year on the industrial demand. And we do have a detailed slide on that in the slide deck on -- #54 will give you a breakdown on that, but we've seen a 2% increase in industrial demand. 
Mark Barnett: Yes. I mean, I guess I wasn't really -- I didn't really mean in the financial results from the usage, because as you said, you have good protection there, and it worked very well. I guess I just kind of wanted some more general commentary on the economic environment across your territories. 
Fred Meisenheimer: Well, Texas has generated more jobs than anywhere else in the country and continues to do so. The economy here is very good. Texas is probably -- and in fact, I heard on the news this morning, it's been deemed the most business-friendly state in the U.S., and the economy here has remained better than most of the rest of the country. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Golden with JPMorgan. 
Joshua Golden: A quick question on the increased capital expenditure plan. You did mention that you'd be issuing some incremental debt and potentially some equity. Debt-to-capital has increased slightly. Can you give me an idea, sort of a range that you want to stay debt to capital-wise throughout the build-out? And sort of just comment on your credit ratings for us. 
Fred Meisenheimer: We have stated and will continue to state and will stay within this range of the 50% to 55% of debt-to-cap. That's the sweet spot from the regulator standpoint. That's where we have the company now. We're 50-50 right now. And we will stay in the 50% to 55% range throughout our 5-year cycle here that we're looking at, and we'll actually improve a little over time in the out years. 
Joshua Golden: Okay. Excellent, I appreciate it. And any thoughts on the higher credit rating? I know you were recently upgraded, but given the focus on internal growth instead of acquisitions and the emphasis on the regulated operations, it seems like the organization could actually procure a higher rating. Any thoughts on that? 
Fred Meisenheimer: Well, we visit with the 3 rating agencies each year, and we have recently visited with them. Fitch did come out the other day and reaffirmed our ratings as an A- and stable. They have us one notch higher than the other 2 have us. We believe with these basic numbers, that we are very, very high in the rating grouping and possibly one notch higher. For whatever reasons the rating agencies are -- have not -- 2 of them have not bumped us up into that higher notch. From a regulatory standpoint, we get very good treatment being in the BBB+ class where we are from the standpoint of regulators. While it would be nice to be a notch higher, it's not something that we feel is absolutely necessary. 
Operator: Mrs. Giles, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. 
Susan Giles: Thank you, Claudia. Just as a reminder, a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through August 8. And if you have any additional questions, please call me, I'm around all day, or visit us at the upcoming AGM Financial Forum. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you all for joining us. Goodbye.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-02-08 08:00:00) =====
Executives:  Susan Giles - VP, IR Kim Cocklin - President and CEO Fred Meisenheimer - SVP and CFO
Analysts:  Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs Faisel Khan – Citigroup John Hansen  (Peter Arch – ZLP) 
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Atmos Energy first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you Mrs. Giles you may begin. 
Susan Giles: Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize the financial results. We will refer to just a few of the slides during the call, but we will be happy to take any questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast for slides, please visit our website at atlasenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the Company’s Form 10-Q later today. Our speakers this morning are Kim Cocklin, President, and CEO, and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations; please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim. 
Kim Cocklin: Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everybody, and we certainly appreciate you joining us, and your interest in Atmos Energy. Before we begin, I’d like to extend my congratulations to all the Giants fans on the phone, and condolences to the Patriots and the Cowboy fans. Yesterday, we did report first quarter consolidated net income of $69 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to $74 million or $0.81 per share one year ago. When you exclude the unrealized gains in both periods, net income was $56 million or $0.61 per share this quarter compared to 74 million or $0.81 last year. Regulated operations contributed 93% of our net income and non-regulated operations contributed the remaining 7%.  Regulated earnings were in line with our first quarter expectations of fiscal ’12. Abundant natural gas supply across the nation has created a low gas price environment, which is extremely good for utility customers. However, our non-regulated operations are adversely impacted by such a low price and low volatility and did not contribute as expected. Our liquidity and financial position remain very strong. Our debt capitalization ratio is 53.4% at December 31, compared with 51.4% one year ago. Short-term debt this quarter increased to $390 million compared to $248 million in last year’s quarter, primarily to fund natural gas purchases in our non-regulated segment and increase capital spending. During the quarter we purchased about 388,000 shares under our current share repurchase program at an average price of $32.31 per share.  Also during the quarter, we resolved the FERC investigation that arose in 2007 in our non-regulated segment. Under the terms of that agreement, we paid about $12 million plus accrued interest. We cooperated with the FERC throughout the process, and had adequate reserves for the resolution.  Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared the 113th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal ’12 is $1.38. Our CFO, Fred Meisenheimer, will review our financial results in greater details now, and I’ll return for closing comments and we’ll open up the call for questions. Fred?
Fred Meisenheimer:  Thanks, Kim, good morning, everyone. As a reminder, because of the agreement to sell our distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, we combine and report financial results for those assets on the income statement as discontinued operations. Therefore, the corresponding detail by line item will be excluded from my prepared discussions. Rate relief remains the primary driver of our success in the regulated operations. Rate increases for distribution Atmos’ pipeline Texas combined, generated almost $13 million of incremental margin quarter-over-quarter with about $5 million for distribution, and $8 million for APT.  Specifically, distribution margins were negatively impacted by utilizing required updated weather data to calculate the weather normalization adjustment in the Mid-Tex division, which we expect to substantially flip around by the end of the heating season.  Regulated Transmission and Storage, we refer to as APT, benefited from the rate case that became effective last May. Also, during the current quarter, APT’s consolidated throughput rose 5% due to increase through system demand and the execution of new delivery contracts with local producers. Turning now to our non-regulated operations, and you may want to turn to slide number 7. The on-going and on-favorable market cash conditions continue to pressure this segment. We anticipate natural gas storage levels will remain high for an extended period of time, and for unseasonably warm weather to continue during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  We expect gas prices to remain relatively low, with little volatility, and spot to [inaudible] spread values and basis differentials to remain compressed.  Realized delivery gas margins decreased about $5 million for the same period one year ago, due to a 4% decrease in consolidated sales volumes, mainly due to warmer weather, which reduced sales to our utility, municipal and other weather-sensitive customers. These decreases were partially offset by a 6% period-over-period increase in sales, to new and existing industrial and power generation customers. A decrease in gas delivery [inaudible] margins from $0.15 per MCL in the prior year quarter, to $0.10 per MCL in the current year quarter, primarily due to lower basis differentials, resulting from high natural gas storage levels, coupled with increased transportation rates charged by the interstate pipelines to be utilized to deliver natural gas to our customers. Realized asset optimization margins decreased to about $26 million from the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter, due to compressed spot forward spread values, AEH traded more frequently in the daily cash market, and earned intra-month trading gains that exceeded the demand fees paid for its contracted storage capacity. In the current quarter, AEH elected to take advantage of falling natural gas prices by purchasing and injecting a net 15.7 Bcf into storage, and capturing incremental physical spread values that should be realized in future periods. As a result of this decision, we realized no storage withdraw gains to offset the realized losses on the settlement of financial instruments used to hedge these natural gas purchases. We anticipate this trend will continue during the fiscal second quarter. However, based on the current setup, a substantial portion of the incremental margins captured during the quarter are anticipated to be realized during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 when contracts expire and the realized gains are recognized. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2012. As a reminder, our practice is to provide annual earnings guidance only. We have affirmed our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $2.30 to $2.40 per diluted share and have updated the expected contribution by the business segment. This range assumes no mark-to-market impact as of December 31, 2012, but does include a pre-tax book gain of $5 million from the sale of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa distribution assets, which is still anticipated to close by the end of fiscal 2012. Let me draw your attention to Slides 20 and 21, where we have outlined our budget assumptions and net income by segment. Our projections now include a $3 million increase to net income reach at the regulated gas distribution segment and the regulated transmission and storage segment, with an equal and offsetting $6 million decrease in the non-regulated segment.  As a result of the challenges of high natural gas storage levels, and the unseasonably warm weather, we are now re-projecting non-regulated delivered gas and storage and transportation margins to range between 70 to $75 million, down slightly from the $74 to $82 million previously. We also anticipate delivered gas volumes of between 435 to 445 Bcf, down about 10 Bcf at a per unit rate of $0.12 to $0.13, which were originally forecast at $0.13 to $0.14.  Our original guidance for non-regulated asset optimization margin assumed summer/winter spreads of about $0.49, with associated storage fees of $0.34, netting to $0.15 per decatherm.  Due to the erosion of spread values and the continued weak market fundamentals I just mentioned, we are lowering our expectations for asset optimization margins to the range of breakeven to $2 million.  For the near-term, we are expecting asset optimization activities, to at least offset the contracted storage demands. We do not perceive returning to the level of margin contribution we experienced in previous years of high market volatility. Keep in mind, however, storage is essential for the over 1,000 customers to which AEH provides services, such as our distribution divisions, utilities, and other regulated municipalities contracting for firm natural gas supply.  We are working to shorten the lease terms for the contracted storage to one year or less, to better manage storage cost. Total amount of regulated margins are expected to be between $70 and $77 million, again with no impact from mark-to-market of our physical storage and offsetting financial hedges. In the regulated segments, we have confidence that we can achieve a $6 million increase in net income. Because of the mild weather we encountered in the first quarter, and continue to experience in the current quarter, our crews are able to focus on capital projects, thus reducing O&M expenses.  Additionally, they have not encountered an adverse weather event, which drives incremental O&M to overtime and general expenses associated with such a weather event. This held true for both our distribution and regulated pipeline operations. Also in our distribution business, the new Rule 8 regulated, encourages spending for [inaudible] safety and reliability in Texas. It also allows regulatory asset treatment, and defers expenses for carrying costs. We now have more clarity and a better understanding as to the treatment of these expenses, and believe there’s a upside, which we did not anticipate when our fiscal 2012 guidance was first announced. In our regulated transmission and storage segment, lower O&M cost from the absence of a weather event as I just mentioned, as well as a shift to more capital type work with the 70 degree weather we’ve been experiencing, also should reduce O&M expenses from second quarter. Also, at the regulated pipeline, we’re getting better value for our proprietary storage and commanding higher demand fees on new contracts than we anticipated. There’s a strong appetite from producers and marketers for firm capacity transportation, which Kim will discuss in a minute. Our original earnings projection assumed an average short-term interest rate of about 60 basis points, which is currently running at just 40 basis points. We think we’ve got about $1 million of upside from the remainder of the fiscal year. We have increased our capital budget by $50 million, which sets a new range of between $680 to $700 million for fiscal 2012. The increased capital spending will primarily be at Atmos Pipeline Texas. Kim will offer more details in a few minutes. As you know, the second fiscal quarter historically generates the greatest revenue for us. We remain optimistic that we can achieve earnings per diluted share of between $2.30 to $2.40 and a consolidated net income range between $210 million and $220 million for fiscal 2012. Thank you for your time, and now I’ll hand the call back over to Kim. Kim?
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much, Fred. Capital investment, as Fred talked about is an extremely important component of our earnings growth. As you well know, it increases our rate base, and the more valuable the rate base for a regulated operation, the greater opportunity for increased revenues and growth.  And as Fred mentioned, we are projecting investing significant capital on our intrastate Atmos Pipeline Texas system, to increase its capacity to secure new, long-term gas supply on a firm reliable basis and enhance the reliability of our service in certain critical locations along the Mid-Texas system. And this was approved by our Board of Directors yesterday when they added and increased the capital budget for fiscal ’12 by $50 million, as Fred said. There’s two projects that we’re talking about. The first is the Line W Looping project, which is designed to secure new long-term gas supply for the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area. Atmos Pipeline Texas is going to spend between $47 and $52 million in capital to construct a 34 mile, 24-inch high-pressure pipeline North of Fort Worth, connecting Boyd, Texas to a producer’s interconnect in Montague County. The project is supported by a multi-phased firm transportation agreement, with a producer for deliveries to the North side loop, through the year 2019. The rates, which are designed on a straight fixed variable basis will consist of demand fees, which are expected to generate incremental annual revenue of $10 to $14 million beginning in fiscal 2013. A lot of the project up there is driven by the continued drilling by producers of wet gas and gas that’s associated with oil in the Montague County area. Also, during fiscal ’12, through fiscal 2014, Atmos Pipeline Texas is projected to spend between $110 and $120 million in capital to construct a 59-mile, 24-inch high-pressure pipe that connects Line X, south of Fort Worth, up to Boyd, and the new Line W that I just talked about. This pipeline is intended to eliminate the dependency of an interruptible exchange agreement, and improve service reliability during critical peak periods to current regulated customers of Atmos Pipeline Texas. These capital expenses are GRIP eligible with a 11.8% return on equity, and the project certainly improved the reliability of our pipeline system for the customers we serve. As we outlined last November, we are planning increased capital investment over the next five years, in particular to fortify our regulated asset infrastructure. We expect to grow our regulated rate base from between 6 and 6.5% on a compounded annual basis during this five-year period, resulting in earnings growth and enhancing the reliability and safety of our regulated assets. We continue to successfully execute our rate strategy to reduce lag, improve return on equities and increase recovery of fixed cost. Last week, we filed a rate case in the Mid-Tex division, which request an annual operating income of 46 million for the effective cities. It’s based on a proposed return on equity of 10.9%, resulting in an overall return, proposed overall return of 8.74%. The cap structure in the case is 49% debt, 51% equity, the authorized rate base investment is $1.53 billion. Case is based on a test year that ended September 30, 2011, with a forward-looking plan investment and associated deferred taxes included through March of 2012. We’re also seeking the approval of a new annual rate review mechanism, which would allow – continue to allow annual cost adjustments without the need to file future rate cases. The case, you remember, was filed as the result of the existing rate review mechanism expiring at the end of January. We were unable to renew that rate review mechanism, so we did file this rate case to address the deficiency in the Mid-Tex division. As you may recall, our fiscal 2012 projections did not include any rate increase in the Mid-Tex division because we were continuing negotiations with the cities at that time to renew the rate review mechanism. Also, in the Mid-Tex division we filed the first City of Dallas annual rate review filing in January, requesting an increase in operating income of $2.5 million. Copies of the Mid-Tex filings can be found on our website.  So far this fiscal year, rate outcomes have provided annual operating increases of $7.7 million. Other rate actions, which we have filed and are pending include a Kanas case, which seeks an increase of 6.1 million, and a filing that we made yesterday for West Texas, which seeks $11 million there. In total, we have about $66 million in rate request outstanding, and anticipate filing another 10 to 15 cases this fiscal year, which would request between $20 and $30 million of additional operating income increases. We started fiscal ’12 on solid footing. We’ve got – continue to have very healthy credit ratings, which lets us borrow money at very attractive rates. Our balance sheet is very strong, and we’re focused on keeping our cap structure within the 50 to 55% range. And we remain committed to growing our assets and delivering consistent long-term financial success. We thank you for your time this morning, and we’ll open the call up for questions now. Jackie? 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question is coming from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Good morning, guys. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Good morning, Ted. It’s a shock that you’d be the first one. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Maybe I can just come back to the distribution segment. I’m kind of trying to understand exactly – I’m not sure I followed the weather normalization impact here. You’re saying that you think it will largely reverse, it sounds like, in your fiscal second quarter. Can you go again into the drivers of – you bulked up a little bit in the segment, I think about $3 million. What were the drivers for why that went up this quarter? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Well, you know, we’re experiencing unusually warm weather, and so we have redirected our crews, instead of doing O&M type work, they’re working more on capital projects. With the absence of any weather events, we’re not incurring the overtime and additional administrative costs that are related to that and so we’re seeing upsides from those things occurring and reducing the expenses. We’ve gotten some results in some of our rate activity that we’ve had that has been a little better than what we had in our original estimates and so that has improved things.  And then also, as we’ve gotten more into this Rule 8 and the benefits from that, we’re able to defer and capitalize certain costs. We’ve realized that there’s more benefit there than what we originally anticipated. So kind of a combination of all of those things.  We feel very, very confident in being able to raise the level of income for most of our regulated unit segments, both the utility and the pipeline. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank, Fred, that’s helpful. And next for me, on the Mid-Tex rate case here, I guess I’m trying to understand how you’re seeing this play out. It looks like you’re – if I look at your Slide 14, you’re thinking you’re probably going to have this 90-day suspension and then, I’m just wondering what kind of feedback you’re getting with your initial filing for the cities. It may be a couple of things. It looks like your more than doubling the fixed charges for the residential customers off kind of the thinking there. And then are you looking to make this into a multi-year settlement like you had last time where you’ll have the RM go forward for three or five years? 
Kim Cocklin:  Ted, this is Kim. The filing was obviously well known by all of the effected customers because we had a lot of discussions leading up to the time that the case was filed. So they were very familiar with what the case involved and what the case was going to require because all of this was part of the negotiations to extend the current RM.  We’re extremely pleased with the relationships that we’ve developed in that we continue to strength with all of the city customer in the Mid-Tex division. You’re exactly correct, we are proposing to increase the fixed customer charge that would be very similar to the way that we designed rates and a lot of other division including – well, most other divisions, but it would reduce the commodity charge. You know, I think the case, the customers continue to be very open and receptive about discussions and are interested and are taking – I mean, this is their opportunity to look and see, you know, why we need what we need, or why we’re proposing what we’re proposing.  So we think that there’s a good likelihood, at least we are going to be very earnest and sincere and desires of reaching a settlement in the case. But we, you know, we haven’t baked any upside in the 2012 results. But I think, you know, that the – at the end of the day, the customers are very, very satisfied and I think happy with the way that they are and has operated up to this point. It’s kind of a considered pain of everyone that, you know, at the end of the day we will seek a middle ground, which provides a win-win outcome for all of the parties involved in the case and continue to have an RM after we finish the proceedings. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. 
Kim Cocklin:  We’re pretty optimistic because of the relationships that are there. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay, that’s helpful and the just this last one for me on these – the new regulated transition lines. I saw that you’ve got the Line W project contracted out to 2019, but I didn’t see what the duration of the contracts for the Line X to Boyd. Can you just talk about that? And then I guess I’m trying to understand, if you’ve got these demand terms that are already locked in from your pre-cert customers, but you’re also going to get GRIP recovery, are you really recovering your cost twice or how does that interplay between GRIP and the drifting demand charges? 
Kim Cocklin:  Yes, we’ve never recovered our cost twice. No, we’re not recovering our cost twice. They’re two separate projects. The one project is essentially, you know, with the – part of the Rider Rev treatment revenues for third-party transportation. That contract with the producer would be considered part of those third-party revenues and so what we would experience is 25% of the upside associated with those revenues and credit 75% back. The project is very beneficial and it is, you know, moving a lot of volumes that are associated with gas, or I should say with oil in [Inaudible] County. So they’ve got to move.  The other project that you’re talking about really replaces an interruptible agreement that the pipeline had been relying upon to provide service for a lot of the regulated customers that it has, in particular, the Mid-Tex division. So you know, we experienced some operating history last year when we had the very peak conditions at the end of January and early February and during those times we have an opportunity to look where certain sensitive spots are on the system and where we need to fortify our assets, and that’s essentially what that project is doing, it’s replacing the interruptible exchange that was relied upon and replacing it with a firm capability to reach the areas that we’re currently serving and that are growing at a pretty good clip in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks, I appreciate the detailed answers. 
Kim Cocklin:  Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Good morning, guys. 
Kim Cocklin:  Good morning, Faisel.
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: On the Line X to Boyd, I just wanted to get a clarification there. What are your expected revenues from that line? You gave us the Line W, but I’m trying to figure out the Line X. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  The revenues? 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Right, the revenues that you’ll be producing annually from that particular project. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  You’re talking about not the Line W? 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Right, the Line X. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Well, we don’t – it’s a, you know, it would receive the regular rate treatment, so it’s going to earn 11.8% return on equity. It’s going to be – it would be included in our GRIP filing that we make. So it’s going to be treated as part of the regulated revenue side of that business. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Understood. Can you remind us, on this particular pipeline, how much of that volume – how much of that customer volume is utility base and is producer based? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Yeah, I mean, X would be pretty much all dedicated to providing service to the regulated customers, the utility customers, and that, right now, I mean, you know, we rely on an interruptible exchange agreement with another party that we’ve been told cannot be made firm. What we’ve experienced in that extremely cold snap is that, you know, we need some – we need firm reliable service, particularly on that area of the system because we’ve got some low spots over there on the West side of Fort Worth and then we’ve also got a lot of growth that’s occurring in that area. So it’s going to be regulated, service for regulated customers. To the extent that there’s, you know, additional services provided for third-party producers on off-peak areas, then that revenue also would be counted towards the Rider Rev calculation and then the benefit of credited 75% to the customers and 25% to us.  But it’s really a very, very good deal and it’s, you know, it’s an excellent project for the customers that are served by Mid-Tex in terms of reliability and diversity of supplies, but it also provides us significant growth opportunities of our rate base. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Understood. I just want to make sure I went back to one of your other comments. You said you were projected to grow rate base by about 6% a year for the next four to five years. Is that correct? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  No, 6 to 6.5%. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: And what kind of – how much capital are you going to spend to kind of achieve those rates? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  This year, we’re – capital budget, we’re expecting to spend $700 million. You know, that’s a $50 million increase as of yesterday. This year, the 638 that we were starting out with was an increase of about 40 million or so over the prior year. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: As you spend that incremental capital, is there going to be a regulatory lag in terms of getting recovery? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  A lot of reg money being spent is GRIP eligible and a lot of it comes out of this Rule 8, this new Rule 8, which totally eliminates any lag. A good portion of the money that Mid-Tex will be spending also will be on steel service lines and there’s no lag on that money either. So we’ve got the steel service lines, we will complete that program on 100,000 steel service lines this year and so that money is no lag, GRIP money comes in very quickly and the Rule 8 money is no lag, plus we’re able to defer a lot of the cost; depreciation, interest, et cetera in relation to the Rule 8 spending. So it’s a very beneficial type spending money. 
Kim Cocklin:  And Susan can get you the reg rate on the capital investment, you know, historically and it’s wrapped up pretty considerably. And then it supports further the lag what we’ve done there. At last count, and I don’t know where we’re at right now, about 90 to 93% of the capital that’s invested on the regulative side of the business begins to earn a return on it’s investment within 12 months. We’ve cut it down considerably and as Fred said, this Rule 8 treatment is really – has ramped up the opportunity to reduce lag. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: And what would you guys say your – the growth rate was in the rate base in the last five years? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  4 to 4.5%. 
Faisel Khan – Citigroup: Okay. Fair enough. Okay, I appreciate the time. 
Kim Cocklin:  Thank you. We appreciate your time and interest. 
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our next question is coming from John Hansen of [Inaudible]. 
John Hansen : Good morning. 
Kim Cocklin:  Good morning, John. 
John Hansen : I just want to double check one thing and make sure I got this straight here. In the release, you talked about the, how optimization and the inventory of gas and how some of the accounting worked. I just want to make sure I understand; you made the statement that you expected that to be realized in the third and fourth quarters, the incremental margin kind of got available in inventory there. My question is, is that locked in at this particular point in time, or is it contingent on any kind of changes in price, or is that pretty much locked in? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  It’s locked in. The way it’s set up right now, third and fourth quarter, we have locked in gains, you know, that roll off and we will realize the money from that. 
John Hansen : So in between now and then, we’re just going to be probably subject to the whims of the prices and remarking each quarter in terms of the inventory? 
Kim Cocklin:  Yes. You’re going to probably see that, you know, what we’ve experienced in the first quarter for non-reg will continue in the second. 
John Hansen : Okay, good. Thank you very much. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  And it will be [inaudible] five quarters, three and four. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Thank you. Our next question is coming from (Peter Arch of ZLP). 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Yes, good morning. 
Kim Cocklin:  Good morning, Peter. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): A couple of housekeeping questions. First, on the sale of the distribution assets, Kim, I was hoping you could update us on where that stands and what needs to happen to get across the finish line. 
Kim Cocklin:  That’s on track and everything continues to work it’s way through the regulatory process and on the timeline that we anticipated and we continue to expect to have a successful close in fiscal 2012. Probably looking at a May timeline right now when the transaction would close for us. I mean, Iowa and Missouri waived on it and Illinois and Missouri, we’ve had several very positive and successful meeting with the purchaser included and the staff of the Commission involved, and we seem to be working our way with really no big – no show-stoppers, no big issues. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay, thanks. And that kind of leads to the next question. On Slide 20, one of the assumptions you’re making, you know, the 230 to 240 this year, the first bullet point is assuming a contribution from these properties of 9 to $0.11 in that - so I'm just trying to understand that that – is that an annualized number or is that the earnings of the discontinued opts that you anticipate through May? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  That’s an annual number. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay, Fred, and would you have the quarterly breakout, like you did for this quarter where you broke out the discontinued ops for the first quarters of ’11 and ’12? Would you have the third through – second through fourth quarters’ contributions? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  No, we don’t have that. We break it out as we report the results, you know, consolidated results and then we break out the discontinued portion and then give some granularity on that because on the [inaudible] financials, it’s a one-liner, but then we show a breakdown on that as we’re reporting our earnings.
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay, great. And then you know, again, the [inaudible], you lose this 9 to $0.11 of annualized earnings but redeploy the 124 million of proceeds. What will that be… 
Fred Meisenheimer:  And that’s correct. And one thing to remember, this discontinued earnings is the accounting required calculation of that and so they do not – the accounting rules do not allow certain costs to be allocated that normally would be allocated to those operations And in the regulated environment, we have the ability to, once we dispose of these assets, to reallocate those overhead costs to other restrictions and recoup that. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): I see. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Normal – you know, an unregulated type environment, those certain overhead costs would discontinue and you don’t recoup them. We’re able to reallocate that and recoup those down the road. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): How much, Fred? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Oh, it’s in the neighborhood of 6 to $8 million on an annual basis. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay, great. Thank you. And the – have you – remind us, have you said what the after-tax proceeds will be out of the 124 million in after-tax…? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  Proceeds or gain? 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Well, I mean, yeah, the after-tax proceeds. 
Fred Meisenheimer:  We just disclosed about a $5 million pre-tax gain is the only thing that we’ve disclosed. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay. Fair enough. The other questions have to do with the FERC investigation and you had – you got paid a penalty and some disgorgement of profits, just $12 million. I didn’t know if you had reserved against that or is there earnings that that you felt in your first quarter? 
Fred Meisenheimer:  There was no earnings impact to us currently on that. It had been reserved in prior time periods. 
(Peter Arch – ZLP): Okay, great. Thanks very much, Fred. 
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions). Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Susan Giles:  Thank you, Jackie. I just want to remind you all that recording of this call is available for replay on the website through May the 2nd. Again, we appreciate your time. 
Operator:  Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You many disconnect your lines.

===== 2011 Q3  (2011-08-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Atmos Energy’s fiscal 2011 third quarter conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) as a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to your host, Ms. Susan Giles, VP; Investor Relations for Atmos Energy Corporation. Thank you Mrs. Giles you may begin.
Susan Giles: Thanks Jenny, good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will refer to just a few of the slides during the call, but of course we are happy to take any questions online at the end of our prepared remark. If you would like to access the webcast for slides, please visit our website at atlasenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the Company’s Form 10-Q later today this afternoon. Our speakers today are Kim Cocklin, President, and CEO, and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations; please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements and are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Kim Cocklin. Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much Susan and good morning everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. It looks like the market is in for a wild rise as we begin our call too but yesterday we did report a third quarter consolidated net loss of $600,000 a negative $0.01 per diluted share. For the current nine month period, reported net income was almost $206 million or $2.25 per diluted share. There were lot of moving parts which are going to be addressed by Fred Meisenheimer. During the quarter, we did announce the sale of our distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa which comprised about 84,000 meters at a price of approximately $124 million and the purchase through Liberty Energy, a sub-city area of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. From a geographical standpoint, this is a very rational decision; we have had a limited presence in these jurisdictions and we did not proceed growing our market share or expanding our foot print in these areas and these transactions will allow us to better focus on the remaining jurisdictions where we operate. Applications with the Illinois and Missouri agencies, commission were filed on Monday August 1, and we do anticipate the transaction to close in the latter half of our fiscal in 2012. Currently we expect the use of proceeds to fund capital programs but looking further out, we could also redeploy the proceeds to fund or partially fund an acquisition if a worthwhile asset presents itself. Also this quarter we recognized a partial impairment of our non-regulated segments gathering facilities in Kentucky, which we call the Shrewsbury Park City Systems. Taking this action was the result of examining our capabilities and recognizing that we simply do not have the depth of expertise that is needed to pursue and develop Greenfield projects such as this. We are also going to talk about the financial implications of this action. We do continue to focus on enhancing our financial profile and as part of our strategy this year; we have reduced the number of credit facilities, extended the length of their terms and reduced financing cost. Most recently on June 10, we issued $400 million of third year senior notes at a rate of 5.5%, which replaced the $350 million note which had matured in May and carry a 7 and 3A [ph] interest rate. Taking into account the effective of our Treasury locks, the effect new issue is 5.38%. Refinancing the $350 million note and even adding an incremental $50 million in debt will generate interest savings of over $4 million per year for the next 30 years and as a result of our precedential [ph] demand for our paper coupled with a greater appetite for capital dollars this year for pipeline integrity projects, we outsized the debt offering to $400 million from the originally anticipated $300 million dollars. Of course throughout the year we have been in step with the rating agencies on all of our actions. Overall our strategy was viewed quite favourably by the agencies and were warranted the following rating A upgrades. On May 11, Moody’s raised its corporate credit rating on Atmos Energy to Baa1 from Baa2 and on June 2, Fitch raised its corporate rating on us to A- from BBB+, both agencies indicated a stable outlook for the company. The upgrades will allow us to continue to access the capital markets on more economically favourable terms. As of last night, we had about $56 million of commercial paper outstanding at about 30 basis points and as the end of June, our net capital ratio was 48.6% compared with 51.3% at September 30, and 48.4% a year ago. Our board of directors yesterday declared the 111 consecutive quarterly cased dividends. The indicated annual dividend ratio for fiscal 2011 is $1.36. Now, Fred Meisenheimer our CFO will review our financial results in greater detail and then we will return for posing comments and questions, Fred.
Fred Meisenheimer: Thanks Kim, good morning everyone. I will speak to the more significant items in the quarter and nine months and then discuss the outlook for the reminder of our fiscal year. As a result of the agreement to sell our distribution assets in Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa we just now combined in report to financial results for these assets, a one line item on the income statement entitled discontinued operations for all periods presented. Therefore, the corresponding detail by line item will be excluded from my comparative discussions. In accordance with accounting pronouncements, the discontinued operation results do not receive allocated corporate overhead or interest expense. Of course until we close the sale of these properties they will remain a part of our total consolidated results and contribute to our overall earnings. As we stated in the earnings release; the current quarter and year-to-date results were impacted by several onetime items. In the current quarter, the impairment of our non-regulated segments gathering facilities as Kim just mentioned; acquainted to a negative $6 million or $0.06 per diluted share. We still have a balance $6 million on the books for these assets. Revenues are currently sufficient to support this level of investment. For the current nine months, onetime items equalled almost a positive $7 million or $0.07 per diluted share. These items included the impairment I just mentioned as well as the earlier impairment of the Ft. Necessity storage project, the benefit from unwinding Treasury locks and a tax benefit from settling various income tax positions. By eliminating the onetime items in all periods and the mark to market accounting treatment required, by GAAP and our non-regulated operations which we have done for you on slides 44 and 45. The company earned $0.05 per share for the current quarter versus $0.09 per share for the prior year quarter and $ 2.20 per share for both nine month periods. Now let’s take a closer look at the major driver’s by segment. Rate relief remains primary ground of our success in the distribution business. Rate increases generate almost $8 million of incremental margin, quarter-over-quarter an almost $36 million of incremental margin for the nine months. Mainly from the Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky and Kansas service areas. For the nine months consolidated distribution throughput was 8% lower which decreased gross profit by about $11 million as the unseasonably cold weather experienced last year did not reoccur this year. Atmos Pipeline of Texas gross profit increased; by almost $9 million for the quarter and almost $ 11 million for the nine months. Like the distribution segment, rate relief is also the main driver of our success at the regulated pipeline. The quarter-over-quarter increase is primarily the result of the Texas Railroad Commission order granting annual operating increases of about $20 million which became effective on our May 1, bills. The current nine months also been accretive from the roughly $9 million or incremental rent relief from the last rate case, but in addition the pipeline experienced a $6 million increase, as a result of the annual grip recovery period-over-period. Partially offsetting the positive impacts from rate actions was almost a $3 million decline in throughput to our Mid-Tex utility Division as a result of warmer winter weather. Remember the pipeline deliver gas to our mid-Tex utility division and is not weather normalized. The rights to the utility customers are established by the Texas Railroad Commission and are higher than the rates for other APT customer classes to ensure long transportation storage service to these customers. Additionally, the pipeline experienced about $2 million decline in third party market base per unit transportation margins. Looking ahead, we expect to be insulated on about 81% of our fiscal 2011 through system transportation revenues under the demand based contracts executed with producers and marketers. We are continuing to seek replacement contracts when they expire. Turning now to the non-regulation operations and you may want to turn to slides eight and 16. Period over period, gross profit increased for almost $2 million for the quarter and declined about $37 million for the nine months. Margins from gas deliveries decreased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter due to $0.03 decrease in unit margins. Overall, we experienced an 18% rise in sales volumes, largely due to increased power generation demand. Our market areas continue to experience strong competition, which serves to drive per unit margin lower. For the nine months delivered gas margins increased $1 million year-over-year due to a 9% increase in sales volume with comparable average margins of about $0.14 for both periods. Industrial volumes for the nine months rose 18% year-over-year. The most significant driver in the non-regulated business in the quarter in here to date has been the lack of natural gas price volatility, yielding smaller captured spread values, which is translated into sizable reductions and we realized asset optimization margins. In the prior year periods, we were able to take advantage of more favourable trading opportunities in the daily cash market. Quarter-over-quarter, our last asset optimization margin declined $13 million and $47 million from the comparable nine month period. Additionally, during the prior year quarter, we were able to recognize higher spread values that were captured from rolling positions. Quarter-over-quarter decrease from the last asset optimization market was more of an offset about a $15 million increase in unrealised margins. That reflects a quarter-over-quarter timing of our last margins coupled with lowered natural gas price volatility. For the current nine months, unrealized margins increased to about $8 million. Consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the nine months decreased about $7 million compared to the same period one year ago. Our employee-related costs decreased about an $11 million and bad debt expense decreased about $2 million. This expense reduction from partially offset of the absence of about $7 million state sales tax received in the prior year. Quarter-over-quarter, operating expense increased primarily as a result of $11 million non-cash impairment charge of the Park City and Shrewsbury gathering assets in Kentucky. Operating expense increased for the nine months primarily to $30 million of asset impairments which includes that $11 million of gathering assets I just mentioned was the $19 million non-cash impairment charge of the Fort Necessity that we announced last quarter. Income tax expense was favourably impacted in the current nine month from a $5 million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions recognized earlier this year. Now that we have completed three quarters of our fiscal year; we expect that fiscal 2011 earnings per share guidance in the lower-end of the range of the $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As you know, with the seasonality of our business we often experience breakeven or even negative financial results during our fourth quarter. We have updated the expected contribution of our business segment and this range assumes no material mark-to-market impact at September 30, 2011. Let me draw your attention to slide 36 where we have outlined our re-projected income statement. The increase in projected net income of about $4 million for the regulatory distribution segment, this result by continued focus from expense management and higher than plenty of capitalization from our increased capital spending. The increase in projected net income of about $6 million for the regulated transmission and storage segment is due to the favourable outcome of the APT rate case that went in to effect on May 1, 2011. An increase of about $400 million to the rate base and an ROE increased to an 11.8% from 10% are the main factors driving the uptick in APTs re-projections. The non-regulated segment, net income projection decreased about $10 million since the last quarter, $6 million of which reflects a partial impairment of the gathering assets. The remaining decrease is due to lower asset optimization margins, resulting from the continued weak market fundamentals and erosion in spread values. We have more limited opportunities to capture economic value and lowered expectations for asset optimization markets to between $1 million and $3 million. Total non-regulated margins now assume to be between $75 million and $85 million, again with no material impact from mark to market of physical storage and offsetting financial agents. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 have been revised upward by about $30 million and are now expected to range between $610 million and $625 million. The increase is largely the result of additional pipeline upgrades and replacements from the aging Atoms Pipeline Texas infrastructure. Thank you for your time and I will hand the call back over to Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Thank you very much Fred. I will make a few closing comments and I will take your questions and you can see from hearing Fred, we had a busy third quarter. In spite of the few speed bumps, we had a very good run in the first nine months of our fiscal 2011. We have taken measure to clean up our balance sheet, we have eliminated under earning assets, which will ultimately removed more risk from the business going forward, although there is no market sense of improvement in the economy, our business continues to perform steadily. We have done a very good job of managing expense and we will continue that focus going forward. Our O&M expense is down this year without reducing complement. We were also able to provide annual wage increases to our employees while observing government mandated cost and our uncollectable expense is currently less than one quarter or 1% of total revenues despite the current economic conditions. Our fundamental business is delivering safe and reliable natural gas. We continued this extensively to execute our rate strategy, focusing on reducing our lag, improving our return on our return on equity and increasing the recovery of fixed cost. The stability and predictability of our margins remain vital to our growth. Today, rate outcomes that provided an increased operating income of about $70 million; which exceeds our original target of between $50 and $60 million of approved annual operating income increases from rate actions [ph] in fiscal 2011. On June 22, a rate settlement, a very important rate settlement was reached with the City of Dallas. This allows an annual increase in operating income to take effect of about $2 million, July 1. The settlement provides also for an annual rate review process which is patterned after our other rate structures in Texas. The Dallas annual rate review allows an ROE of 10.1% and a 13 month average capital structure. Rate base was established at $1.27 billion and the first filing under this annual rate review will be made by next January 15 on a September 30 ending test year. We have also talked previously about the final order issued in April on the Atmos Pipeline Texas rate case. It is very important to know that not only where we granted over a $20 million increased to operating income and an ROE of 11.8% as well as the rate based increase from $417 million to $808 million, but this case does lessen our exposure to the market based contract revenues. The Rider Rev mechanism in that case establishes a represented level of revenues for third party services of $84 million and at the end of each year, either a credit or surcharge will be rendered after calculating whether we fell above or below the $84 million threshold. The company retains or refunds 25% of any increase or decrease from that representative level. Additionally, on July 26, APT received approval for a $12.6 million increase in operating income from their most recent GRIP filing. Our focus in the non-regulated operation remains in the deliberate gas business. We are on target to sell 440 to 450 BCF in fiscal 2011 at somewhat lower unit margins of between $0.13 and $0.014 per MCF. The non-regulated business continues to experience downward pressure and lower margins in a very highly competitive market. Especially electric generation to man for power feeding plants this summer, there are some lost later deals that we are mining for the future to pickup more market share. Low gas prices continue as well as little to no spread values and we do expect optimization revenues to make a negligible contribution to earnings going forward. We are lowering our exposure to non-regulated risk. We found that the market simply does not reward us for our non-regulated earnings. We're principally a utility and we expect the earnings contribution for our regulated operations to remains at about 90% or greater going forward. We are going to continue that to focus on the fundamentals get singles and double in our business and remain focused on enhancing shareholder values. We very much appreciate in taking time with us this morning and now we will take your questions, Jen?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions)
Kim Cocklin: Should we sing happy birthday to the President?
Operator: It appears that there are no questions at this time.
Kim Cocklin: Okay.
Susan Giles: Okay Jen, and thank you everyone and as a reminder a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through November 9. Again we appreciate you interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. Good day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-02-03 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Kappes Giles – Vice President of Investor Relations Robert W. Best – Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive Officer Fred E. Meisenheimer – Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Kevin Akers – President Kentucky/Mid-States Division
Analysts: Jonathan Lefebvre – Wells Fargo Securities Barry Klein – Citigroup James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs 
Susan Kappes Giles:  This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the Internet. We have placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will not review them in detail but we will be happy to take questions on any of them at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides please visit our website at www.AtlasEnergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company’s Form 10Q later today.  Our speakers today are Bob Best, Chairman and CEO and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Best. 
Robert W. Best :  Yesterday we were pleased to report first quarter consolidated net income of $93 million or $1.00 per diluted share. Our regulated operations contributed 64% of our total net income while the non-regulated operations contributed 35%. During the quarter we also renewed two committed credit facilities. In October we renewed Atmos Energy Corporation’s $200 million 364 day facility and in December Atmos Energy Marketing’s $450 million 364 day facility was also renewed. During the quarter our debt to capitalization ratio improved to 51% at December 31 compared with 54.4% one year ago. In short term debt this quarter is about half of what it was one year ago. I’ll remind you that the amount of unused borrowing capacity is affected by the seasonal nature of our business. Our working capital requirements increased as we begin the winter heating season. Our high water market for short term debt is traditionally in late January and should begin to decline as customers begin paying their winter heating bills.   Yesterday our board of directors declared our 105th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2010 is now $1.34. Now, I’ll ask Fred Meisenheimer to review the financial drivers for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and then I’ll return for closing comments and we’ll all be glad to take your questions at that time.
Fred E. Meisenheimer : For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, consolidated net income rose 23% and earnings per share were up 20% compared to the same period one year ago. As Bob stated, our current financial results were positively impacted by the mark-to-market accounting treatment required by GAAP and our non-regulated operations and included non-cash unrealized net gains of about $27 million or $0.29 per diluted share.  In comparison, for the same period last year the market resulted in a net loss of $14 million or $0.16 per diluted share, a positive swing of $41 million or $0.45 per share quarter-over-quarter. Also, the positive impact of $3.6 million of net adjustments are $0.04 per share which occurred in last year’s quarter did not recur this year. For comparison purposes if you eliminate the mark-to-market accounting treatment and the onetime items, our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the current quarter are $0.71 compared to $0.95 for the same quarter last year. You may want to look at Slide 38 for this comparison. Let’s take a closer look at the drivers this quarter. The regulated distribution business experienced incremental improvement from rate increase primarily in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. All jurisdictions with recovery mechanisms which collectively increased gross profit by about $2 million. Distribution also benefited from the 7% increase primarily in residential and commercial throughput as a result of extremely cold weather particularly in December. In the regulated transmission and storage segment which we refer to as Atmos Pipeline Texas Division, gross profit decreased about $8 million compared to a year ago primarily from lower transportation profits as well as lower per unit margins. Quarter-over-quarter third party throughput decreased by 35 bcf due to reduced systems spreads, increased competition from new pipeline construction, a decline in Barnett Shale activity and a reduction in electric generation demand. However, the regulated pipeline did experience an increase in industrial volumes of almost 4% quarter-over-quarter. You can see that on Slide 40.  The decline in per unit margins is largely due to the substantial decline in basis spreads. Spreads between the Waha and Houston ship channel hubs were basically flat this quarter. I’ll remind you that we expect to be insulated on about $39 million or 76% of our 2010 projected through system transportation revenues from the multiyear demand based contracts we were able to negotiate with producers and marketers at a time when basis differentials were more robust. These agreements run through 2011. We’ll discuss the reprojected revenues in just a minute. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was a $1.5 million increase due to the implementation of rates from a GRIP filing in Texas to recover 2008 capital expenditures.  Turning now to the non-regulated operations, you might want to look at Slide Seven. Delivered gas margins declined by about $2.5 million quarter-over-quarter primarily due to a 7% decrease in overall sales volumes in the non-regulated marketing segment and a $0.01 decrease in per unit margins from $0.17 to $0.16 this year largely due to the significant decline in basis spreads.  During the quarter we experienced the ongoing impact of the challenging economic times with industrial demand continuing to decline albeit at a moderating rate. Quarter-over-quarter industrial volumes dropped by 15% compared to 20% last quarter and 23% in the June quarter. Again, Slide 40 will give you some detail. Asset optimization margins decreased about $30.5 million quarter-over-quarter due to the timing of realized gains from our storage and trading activities. Gains were realized primarily in the last year’s first quarter but this year we expect to realize gains primarily in our second quarter. As a result of the decision this quarter to defer storage withdrawal gains and roll the corresponding financial instruments to forward months coupled with the narrowing of spreads between current cash prices and forward prices, unrealized margins increased $62.7 million. During the quarter we were a net storage injector and reset our financial hedges to enhance the economic value of our storage book. At December 31st we had $22.7 million of economic value, most of which is expected to be realized in margins next quarter.  Turning now to the expense side of our income statement, [inaudible] expense decreased by about $9 million or 7% in the quarter mainly from lower pipeline maintenance costs at Atmos Pipeline Texas. Additionally, bad debt expense fell by $800,000 to $2.5 million as a result of strong collection efforts, lower gas costs and our ability to recover the gas cost portion of bed debt expense for rate mechanisms in several of our jurisdictions. We were able to keep bad debt expense within our budgeted range of 3/10ths of 1% of residential and commercial revenues. Our cap ex and cash flow; capital expenditures rose about $8 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase reflects spending to relocate our Dallas datacenter. Operating cash flow was down about $56 million from one year ago primarily due to the drop in natural gas prices. Gas costs which were unusually during the 2008 injection season dropped sharply when the economy slipped in to recession and they remain relatively stable since that time. Operating cash flow for the fiscal 2010 first quarter reflects a recovery of lower gas costs through purchase recovery mechanisms and sales. This is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 first quarter where operating cash flow was favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling gas prices.  Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2010 we have affirmed our fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and have updated expected contribution by business segment. Let me draw your attention to Slides 27 through 29 where we have outlined our budget assumptions, net income by segment and income component estimates.  Our projections here include a $7 million increase to net income in the regulated distribution segment with an equal and offsetting decrease in the regulated transmission and storage segment. The lowering of our expectations for Atmos Pipeline Texas is due to our belief that we will continue to experience lower transport opportunities out of the Barnett Shale, relatively narrow basis spreads and other downward pressure from competitors for the remainder of our fiscal year.  As a result, we are reforecasting a reduction of about $11 million in third party market based transportation margin per fiscal 2010. This reduction pertains to the third party transportation volumes that are not covered by our demand base contracts with the large producers. The original budgeted three system revenue of about $62 million is now expected to be $51 million with about $39 million under contract. We expect a $7 million increase at distribution to be obtainable given our better than expected operating results for the first quarter. With our second quarter generating the greatest revenue historically we remain optimistic that we can achieve net income of $116 million to $120 million for fiscal 2010.  On the expense side we have introduced our interest expense projection to a range of $152 million to $158 million. The original estimate of $158 million to $162 was based on winter gas costs of $68 per MCF and short term interest rates of 1.5%. Our average cost of gas at December 31st was $5.12 thereby reducing our short term borrowings and associated interest. We are now projecting gas costs to be in the $4 to $6 range for the remainder of the fiscal year. We estimate that a $1 decrease in gas costs would reduce interest expense and increase pre-tax earnings by about $500,000. Additionally, we are assuming short term interest rates at a level of about one half of 1% as a result of the return to a more stable credit market. We estimate that a 1% drop in the short term borrowing rate would decrease interest expense and increase pre-tax earnings by about $500,000. The remaining assumptions that underline our budget are unchanged. They include continued successful execution of our rate strategy and collection efforts, marketing margins of between $95 and $105 million again, with no mark-to-market impact, no material acquisitions and limiting our bad debt expense to no more than $9 million. Currently, our bad debt expense is running at the budgeted rate of about 3/10ths of 1%. As a reminder, beginning this year we’ve broadened our definition of regulated growth capital to include all capital expenditures that add to rate base which ultimately drives regulated margin growth. In the regulated business, maintenance capital equals depreciation expense, growth capital equals capital spent in excess of depreciation.  We are projecting between $520 and $535 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010. Of that, regulated cap ex is projected to be between $507 and $520 million and non-regulated cap ex is projected to fall between $13 and $15 million. That concludes my remarks and once again here’s Bob.
Robert W. Best : I’ll make a few closing comments and then we’ll be glad to take your questions. As Fred has outlined, we are encouraged by our earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our fundamental business is delivering safe and reliable natural gas under the rules of our regulatory agencies in the states that we serve. Successful rate activity is critical to the financial performance of our gas distribution segment. Last week the Railroad Commission of Texas issued a final order on our November 2008 rate case with the city of Dallas and ENVIRON, served by our mid Texas division. In the final order the Railroad Commission approved a $3 million increase in operating income, a 10.4% return on equity, an overall rate of return of 8.6% and a capital structure of 51% debt and 49% equity. Additionally, the residential monthly customer charge was raised from $14 to $16. We appreciate the Commission’s recognition of the return level necessary to attract capital in today’s environment. By increasing our allowed ROE to 10.4% it provides support to discuss an increase as we pursue the renewal of our rate review mechanism with the [settled] cities in our mid Texas division. We have begun negotiations with the cities and we are very optimistic that the mechanism will be extended. We currently have rate actions filed and pending in our Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Louisiana service area with total about $28 million in requests. We intend to file another 10 to 15 cases in total with requests about $50 million by fiscal year end. Even though Atmos Pipeline Texas has gone through some challenging times this quarter with volumes being lost out of the Barnett Shale and contracting of basis spreads and increased competition in the region, the regulated pipeline remains a very solid asset and has performed very well for us over the years. We expect to file a full rate case in September of this year on the pipeline, our first since we acquired the pipeline in 2004. In the near term we expect to make a filing by the end of March under the Texas GRIP legislation to recover the 2009 capital expenditures on the Atmos Pipeline Texas system. In our non-regulated pipeline business we are in negotiations to enter in to a joint venture agreement with a third party to develop the Fort Necessity storage project and are actively pursuing a reasonable outcome. We have nothing further to report on this matter at this time but we will continue to update you with any material developments when the occur.  Our non-regulated operations will continue to complement the regulated businesses by pursuing and adding value around the utility assets. Over 75% of the marketing segments margins are estimated to be predictable delivered gas sales. Our marketing business is in a very good competitive position operating on 38 pipelines in 22 states. We are expanding in to new markets, most recently in Kansas and Virginia. Atmos Energy Marketing is in a strong credit position having just renewed the $450 million committed revolving credit facility in December. At today’s natural gas prices this is more than ample credit to serve the operational needs of the business.  In closing I’ll just say our company continues to perform at a very high level. As always we strive for consistency and dependability. Our goal remains as it has to grow our earnings per share 4% to 6% a year and we are on track to do that this year for the 10th consecutive year.  That concludes our prepared remarks and now we’ll be glad to take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jonathan Lefebvre – Wells Fargo Securities.
Jonathan Lefebvre – Wells Fargo Securities: I just wanted to touch on Fort Necessity, I know that it’s probably a sensitive topic and you can’t say much but last time you talked about selling that asset and now it looks like you’re looking at a JV. Who should we be thinking about and why the shift? Can you give us any sense about the timing?
Robert W. Best : We’re hopeful that we’ll have something to announce in the near future. We continue to negotiate on that. Really, our goal going in was either to sell the properties – we’ve said before it’s a very good asset but we recognize that the development of storage and a long term project and it’s not something we have particular expertise in. Secondly, it’s going to take a lot of capital and as we’ve reviewed our three to five year plan we recognize that we have many other projects to spend our capital on.  The joint venture part, really either a sale or joint venture was always our goal going in to the negotiations so it really hasn’t been a change in strategy. Either way, as we said, it’s a good asset and we just realize there are others who do this and we’re not in that business so that’s the reason we’re trying to make this sale of Fort Necessity.
Kevin Akers : I wouldn’t characterize it as a shift in our philosophy either. Essentially instead of taking our money out we’re just taking a portion of equity in the project representing our level of investment. As Bob said, the key is we’re not putting more money in the project and we’re going to continue to pursue execution of the documents to close the transaction.
Jonathan Lefebvre – Wells Fargo Securities: Would you be a minority interest or would it be 50/50? Would you try to finance that at the Fort Necessity level?
Kevin Akers : Very minority. We’ve got $20 million in the project and it’s estimated to be priced out at considerably higher than that.
Jonathan Lefebvre – Wells Fargo Securities: Then jus in terms of the acquisition markets, I was wondering if you could give us an updates there, what you’re seeing? If you’re any more or less optimistic on that front? If it’s still a focus?
Robert W. Best : Well, it is still a focus for us I think we will continue to look for good opportunities to grow. In recent times I think if you look back five or six years the prices that were being paid were just beyond what we thought we could compete with or should compete with. I think we see better opportunity in the market but we will continue to look for good opportunities particularly near our existing assets. But, we have nothing to report at this time but we’ll continue to talk and look. Our balance sheet is in good shape so that’s what we always try to do is be ready and be prepared and if a good opportunity comes up we’re able to take advantage of it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Barry Klein – Citigroup.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: With regard to the Atmos Pipeline, you mentioned that increased competition, reduction in the electric demand in Barnett activity were to blame for the pretty significant volume declines. How much of that should we expect to come back and should we expect at least for the rest of the year and maybe going forward this sort of downward impact on volumes?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : The increase competition is from additional pipes that have been put in to service recently. The basis spreads are down there flat basically all the way across and we don’t necessarily see those coming back any time soon. We think that that basis spread will stay down. We think the increased competition will stay out there and so we will lose some amount of throughput to that competition.  As industrial demand begins to rise, we had a slight rise this time 4%, as we see that improving we will see margin of throughput increasing again. That will depend upon recovery in the economy and recovery of the industrial base. 
Barry Klein – Citigroup: Are lower volume numbers included in your guidance number, that $215 to $225 for the rest of the year or only for this quarter?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : The rest of the year. 
Robert W. Best : Back on slide 28 Barry, you’ll see the breakdown and regulated transmission and storage capture is the APT numbers. APT I think Fred captured it right, it’s all a function of the through system business and the decline there. This year we have stepped it down considerably, we’ve reduced our budget estimate to about $51 million from upwards of $62 I think. We started at $62 brought it down to $51 so everything is baked in for the rest of the year so they’re pretty confident we’ve got a good estimate in place right now. We don’t see the basis coming back this year at all. Whether it will be next year or the following year, at some point it will swing back but that portion of the business has been reflected in the annual budget numbers.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: You mentioned 76% of the earnings are insulated, is that for all of Atmos pipeline? Is that basically your take or pay contracts firm transportation is about 76% of the earnings there?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : That’s exactly the transportation that’s been affected by the reductions in the budget. So it’s the transportation we provide for producers in the Barnett Shale that are taking gas from the field to the interstate market. The $39 million represents the demand charges of the $51 million that we have budgeted. So, we’ve got $51 budgeted, we’ve got $39 million for sure. 
Barry Klein – Citigroup: $39 is sort of like for just a capacity that it is take or pay, right?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : It’s demand charges for transportation. We consider take or pay for supply purposes and it’s $39 million for demand charges for just reserving capacity for moving the volumes.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: Then, I’m not sure if I missed it but I think I heard a comment on the call about the marketing division how the unrealized margins during 1Q will be realized in the second quarter or did I miss hear?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : That’s correct. Last year we realized all of that in the majority of our first quarter last year whereas this year where as this year we deferred storage withdrawals and rolled contracts and so we will see that coming in in the second quarter this year.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: So is it fair to say or is this too simple to say that margins on top of whatever you realize normally in the second quarter will be up by above that $37 million in the second quarter or is that too simplistic?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : If you’ll look at the economic value schedule that we have, we show that we have economic value of about $22.7 million and the vast majority, nearly all of that, will come in in the second quarter. 
Susan Kappes Giles: It’s $545 Barry.
Operator:  Your next question comes from James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons.
James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons: Just a follow up question to the last caller, is it possible that any of those unrealized gains could actually come in 2011 or will they all come in 2010? 
Fred E. Meisenheimer : They’re coming in in 2010 the vast majority. 
James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons: So the vast majority in 2010 and then also the vast majority in Q2?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : Yes.
James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons: So there will be some in 2011 but a small amount, is that correct?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : Very small.
James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons: Just a couple of quick follow up questions with Fort Necessity. I wonder if there are any potential incremental costs involved with that and also if you can give us any idea when you think, if everything goes okay with the negotiations with the JV, any idea when you think this could potentially come on line?
Robert W. Best : Well there aren’t any incremental costs on our side of the equation. We are not going to invest anymore in to it and the in service date is kind of moving around but from the time they would start the project or pick it up from where we left off it would probably be about a three year time line before the first cavern which would have a 5 bcf capacity would come on line. So, we’re looking at 2014 probably.
James Lykins – Hilliard Lyons: 2014?
Robert W. Best : Is the sweet spot of the market probably with the storage would be more valuable.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Just a quick follow up, I got sort of the picture of the pipeline, just on the Barnett shale drilling activity can you give us a little more flavor what your expectations are there longer term? 
Robert W. Best : Well longer term obviously we’re very bullish like everybody else is on the drilling activity and most of that stems from the investments that were made by Exxon and Total to take interests out of XPL and Chesapeake. So you’ve got some very major players that are going to come in with some deep capital pockets and have quite a bit of their capital directed towards producing the field. So long term we are very, very excited about the opportunities that are presented in the Barnett Shale. We think it’s ahead of other shale plays that are out there now.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: Where do you see that sort of taking place? I think you guys indicated that you now expect a little less activity and what have you. When do you expect that to turn around and can you just give us more of a flavor of what you’re seeing in the short term versus the long term?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : I’d just say we continue to project gas prices at about the $6 to $8 range and I think if prices stay in that range producers are going to develop. It’s really our hope that they do because then all segments are healthy, producers can go ahead and drill, they can develop the shale for that price and I think we’ve got right now demands down a little bit nationally so that’s having an impact on the supply but I think in the next year to 18 months we expect things to pick up.
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: So basically it does shield demand and the drilling activity you expect to pick up but the basis differential for some time you expect to basically be not really changing very much.
Robert W. Best : I think it stays flat for a while. There’s been a lot of capacity that’s been built and when that capacity fills up that’s when basis will probably start reacting and spreads will become a little more – 
Paul Patterson – Glenrock Associates: How far in to the future do you see that happening?
Robert W. Best : Oh, golly.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Coming back to the marketing, I guess I was just a little surprised that you kept your guidance where it was given on that adjusted basis it looks like the first quarter was down a lot from sort of the first quarter last year. The economic value is kind of at the same level it was last year and you did about $20 million in the segment there so maybe just a little more detail on how you think you’re going to get to the numbers for the full year for ’10?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : Well again last year we recognized or realized those gains in the first quarter where this year in that piece of the business we elected to defer storage withdrawals and we rolled those contracts forward and so we will see that coming in in the second quarter and it is nearly all the economic value you see, the $22.7 million, nearly all of that comes in second quarter. We believe that will happen, some of it is already happening and so it is just movement from one quarter to the next in our view.
Robert W. Best : I think we are also getting some healthy pickups on the utility side with the distribution business. This cold weather is helping throughput. As Fred indicated, we saw a 7% increase in throughput on the utility division and that has helped significantly and we are also continuing to experience pretty cold weather. We had a very good January because when it was cold it was cold and when it was warm it was warm and that’s what we like. February we’ve started out cold in quite a bit of our service territories. The thing that we have to remember is that we’re very geographically diverse so we can take advantage of weather patterns as they move across the country. 
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: I had just a couple of things on the utility side then. The 10.4 ROE for [inaudible] is definitely a nice bump up from the 9.6 that you negotiated. Would you go back in to the settled cities now and sort of say, “Hey, here’s what the Railroad Commission did. We want to reset rates.” Or, d you stay in your current plan at a 9.6 and then maybe renegotiate after the three year deal expires or how are you thinking about that?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : There’s no reopeners but we’re obviously engaged in discussion right now relating to the extension of that mechanism because it does term out and so consequently we have already commenced those discussions and people are very mindful and aware that return is an item that is on the table for discussion and the action by the Commission certainly provides a lot of support and recognition by regulators that a return north of 9.6 is something that is necessary to be competitive to attract capital in today’s market. So we’re very, very optimistic and as Bob said we expect to continue to extend the settlement mechanism.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Then just a small thing, you side you had $7.6 million decrease in revenue related taxes but then your taxes other than income taxes were only down something like $1.6 million, I thought they would move a little closer together. Is there some sort of reason for the mismatch there at the utility?
Fred E. Meisenheimer : They don’t match up exactly dollar for dollar on the dollar in and dollar out. There is some timing that occurs there. As you know we are getting that more in line in recent times and I have included schedules I think in some of the appendix we have with our slide deck showing that information. Over time they are getting closer to a dollar in dollar out and if you look at slide 42 it will show you the effect of the timing on that.
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Susan.
Susan Kappes Giles:  Just as a reminder everybody, a recording of the call is available for replay on our website through May the 4th. If you have any additional questions, please call me. Thank you. Have a great day.

===== 2009 Q4  (2009-11-11 08:00:00) =====

Analysts: James Lykins - Hilliard Lyons Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs Barry Klein – Citigroup Vedula Murti - CDP US 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Susan Giles, Vice President Investor Relations for Atmos Energy.
Susan Giles: This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for analysts. It is being webcast live over the internet. We have placed slides on the website that summarize our financial results. We will not review them in detail but we will take some questions on them at the end of our remarks. If you would like to access the webcast or slides, please visit our website at www.AtmosEnergy.com and click on the conference call link. Our speakers today are Bob Best, Chairman and CEO and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Now I’ll the call over to Mr. Bob Best.
Bob Best: Yesterday we reported earnings of $2.08 per diluted share an increase of 4% from last year again meeting our commitment to deliver average annual earnings per share growth in the 4% to 6% range. However, if you exclude the impact of the mark to market accounting and the impact of our one time items our base line earnings per share were $2.12 for fiscal 2009. Our regulated operations contributed 83% of total net income while the non-regulated operations contributed the remaining 17%.  Our debt capitalization ratio improved to 54.7% at the end of fiscal 2009 compared with 54.6% one year ago. This metric remains a top priority as we strive to preserve our debt capitalization range of 50% to 55% while maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings. Yesterday our Board of Directors declared our 104th consecutive cash dividend and raised the dividend $0.02 bringing our indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2010 to $1.34 per share.  Now I’m going to ask Fred to review the financial drivers for fiscal 2009 and then I’ll return for closing comments and then we will take your questions.
Fred Meisenheimer: Since the quarter is really a shoulder period for us, my remarks will focus on the fiscal year and then I’ll review earnings guidance for fiscal 2010. As Bob mentioned, fiscal 2009 included some positive one time items that we’ve discussed with you throughout the year. These items totaled $17 million of net income or $0.19 per diluted share, as detailed on your slide 51 in your conference call slide deck. Our consolidated results were negatively impacted by the mark to market accounting treatment required by GAAP. Fiscal 2009 had an unrealized net loss of $21.6 million or -$0.23 per share shown on slide 52 but as you know, unrealized margins are temporary and should reverse in future periods. The elimination of both the one time items which totaled $0.19 per diluted share and the mark to market accounting treatment which totals $0.23 per share will result in fiscal 2009 earnings of $2.12 per diluted share as Bob said. Like many of the companies in our sector, our business was impacted by the economic conditions experienced in fiscal 2009 which contributed to the general decline in sales and transportation through put. The real story for the year is incremental improvement from rate increases and rate design enhancements in the distribution business which increased margin by about $30 million. We also had the ability to earn higher per unit margins on our regulated Texas intra-state pipeline and in our non-regulated gas marketing business. Due to prior planning and the diversified contract portfolio enjoyed by Atmos Pipeline Texas the revenue stream was insulated on about 56% of fiscal 2009 through system transportation revenues. We expect to be insulated on about 67% of our 2010 budgeted through system transportation revenues. We successfully executed multi-year demand based contracts for producers and marketers at a time when basis differentials were more robust. Lease agreements run through 2011. The non-regulated gas marketing business experienced delivered gas margins of $0.17 per Mcf which offset the 5% decline in sales volumes which were primarily associated with the industrial margins. Margins benefited from robust year over year basis gains and continued practice of closely monitoring the credit worthiness of our customer base. Although the marketing business records some sizeable unrealized losses, over $37 million of realized margins were generated in storage and trading business. This was the result of the unrealized gains captured in fiscal 2008 that were realized primarily in the first quarter 2009. As natural gas prices have continued to trend downward throughout fiscal fourth quarter we have been a net storage injector and have reset our financial hedges to enhance the economic value of our storage book in fiscal 2010. At September 30, we had $28.6 million of economic value which is expected to be realized in March, its primarily in the fiscal and second quarters of 2010. At the macro level, lower natural gas demand translated to lower natural gas prices. Our average cost of gas at the utility was 23% lower then the previous year. These lower prices reduced our bad debt expense from $16 million last year to just $8 million this year and helped to drive the $548 million increase in our operating cash flow. On the expense side our focus on conserving cash kept O&M excluding bad debt expense flat year over year. Interest charges increased $15 million or 11% from a year ago. About $7 million of that increase can be directly tied to replacing of the $400 million 4% notes with $450 million of 8.5% notes in March/April timeframe. The remaining increase is due to the tightening of the credit markets beginning last fall which made it more expensive to access the capital markets.  As a result we experienced higher commercial paper rates and higher commitment fees on our lines of credit. We also experienced higher average short term debt balances particularly during the first fiscal quarter 2009. At September 30 last year we had about $350 million in short term debt at a weighted average cost of just over 3.5% with only $20 million of commercial paper placed, while the remainder was drawn directly from our five year revolver. Fast forward to September 30 of this year where we had just $73 million of short term debt all placed in the CP market at a rate of just a quarter of 1%. Of course, since we received upgrades by both Moody’s and S&P we’re in certainly better position to access the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements on more economical terms. It is also important to mention that all our financing costs are placed into rates as quickly as possible. After we did the refinancing in March we went to several of our jurisdictions and updated our outstanding filings to adjust for the incremental debt costs we would be incurring this year. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 rose about $37 million to about $510 million mainly due to $33 million in capital spend on line BP extension project at Atmos Pipeline Texas. As you recall this was placed into service in June of this year and we expect the capital expenditure to be eligible for grip recovery in fiscal 2010. Moving now to earnings guidance for fiscal 2010. We’ve announced our fiscal 2010 earnings per share guidance of $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share. The guidance range assumes no material mark to market impact at September 30, 2010. As you can understand we have no way of determining what the mark will be until the end of our fiscal year. Let me draw your attention to slides 41 and 42 where we have outlined our budget assumptions and net income by segment for fiscal 2010. Some of the assumptions of the underlying budget include continued successful execution of our rate strategy and collection efforts. Over the next three year horizon we project operating income increases of about $50 to $60 million annually from our rate outcomes. Marketing margins of between $95 and $105 million again with no material impact from mark to market of our fiscal storage and offsetting financial hedges. We’re projecting asset optimization margins of $23 to $25 million assuming gas price time spreads spot to forward spreads of about $2.00 per Mcf. Storage demand fees of about $10 million and index minus deals of between $4 and $6 million on about 18 to 20 Bcf of storage. Average gas costs ranging from $6.00 to $8.00 per Mcf for the winter purchases and summer gas prices of about $5.00 per Mcf for refilling storage. We’re assuming short term interest rates at the level of about 1.5% as the result of stronger credit ratings the return of more stable credit market. No material acquisitions and limiting our bad debt expense to no more then $9 million. Let me make you aware that our historical presentation of CapEx on slide 47 has changed and is split between maintenance capital and growth capital has been revised. In the past our definition of regulated growth capital was limited to capital that generated incremental margin through metered growth and metered growth only. We found we were applying to narrow when compared to our peers so going forward we’ve broadened our definition of regulated growth capital to include all capital expenditures that add to rate base which ultimately drives regulated margin growth. In a regulated business, growth capital equals capital spent in excess of depreciation. Because we have rate mechanisms in place if we project will allow us to recover about 86% of our capital on accelerated basis and when you factor in our timely filings we expect to have all of about 4% of our budgeted 2010 regulated capital in rate base and earning on that 12 months of capital outlook. Regulated maintenance capital equals depreciation expense. We’re projecting between $520 and $535 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2010. Of that, regulated CapEx is projected to be between $507 and $520 million and non-regulated CapEx is projected to fall between $13 to $15 million. No capital is budgeted for Fort Necessity in fiscal 2010. We continue negotiations for a potential buyer, however, market conditions are not favorable. Overall, low gas prices of summer/winter spreads are influencing the value of storage which impact the potential returns a buyer would require. We are actively pursuing a reasonable outcome and we’ll update you with any material developments when appropriate. That concludes my remarks. Once gain here’s Bob.
Bob Best: I’ll make a few final comments and then we’ll be glad to take your questions. In fiscal 2009 we were able to overcome challenging economic times both financially and operationally to deliver our earnings results. Not only did we increase our earnings, we improved our debt to capitalization ratio, reached positive outcomes in the regulatory arena, and completed the line BP extension project on the Atmos Pipeline Texas System. We will continue to emphasize blocking and tackling fundamentals to reach our financial goals as we move into the future. We continue to access the commercial paper markets on very reasonable terms. Our credit and liquidity positions are strong, aided in part by the two upgrades we received in fiscal 2009 by S&P and Moody’s. We have witnessed a financial situation we remain poised to take advantage of acquisition opportunities which could provide us earnings growth. We recognize that growth along with consistency and predictability are important as we move into fiscal 2010. This covers our highlights for the year. I want to mention before we open it up for questions that yesterday our Board elected Kim Cocklin our President to the Atmos Board of Directors.  With that we’ll now turn it back the operator and questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Lykins - Hilliard Lyons
James Lykins - Hilliard Lyons: A couple of questions about Fort Necessity if you could give us any idea about the timing of the negotiations or is there any chance of this moving forward or are you just looking to sell at this point?
Bob Best: We’ve said publicly before that as we’ve looked at our capital needs for the longer term and as Fred outlined this morning we felt like it wouldn’t be with all the other capital requirements we have on our system that it would probably be better for someone else to develop that story.  Secondly we’re not in the storage development business so again thought that it would be better for us to not go forward with the expenditures that we would have to make to develop the storage. We’re continuing to negotiate, we don’t have anything to announce today. We remain hopeful that we would be able to reach agreement and sell the Fort Necessity property.
James Lykins - Hilliard Lyons: I know you can’t comment specifically but if you do go forward with the sale of Fort Necessity are there some other storage projects that you might be looking at or do you think you might focus on pipeline. If you could give us any kind of feel for what type of projects to maybe expect over the next year or so or what the next catalyst might be.
Bob Best: We would not intend to be in the storage development project business. Our focus is going to be mainly on our pipeline, we’d still feel longer term because of where we’re positioned in Texas in the shale area that there’s going to be some good opportunities for project development there. As well as focusing on our other utility business where I think we still feel particularly in the Metroplex in Dallas that as housing industry comes back that we’ll have some good growth in our residential market. Right now its fairly stagnant but we feel confident long term that that will be growth engine for us too.
James Lykins - Hilliard Lyons: Is there anything else out there that you’re looking at now for what could be next with rate design?
Bob Best: Our concentration really for a very long time now has been on insulating our sales from weather and also getting bad debt and our rates to the extent that we’re allowed to and I think we’ve done that to over 60% of our customer base. Also, working on de-coupling and frankly working on mechanisms that allow us. In our three largest states the mechanisms that Fred described to you allow us to make our recoveries on a very timely basis.  That’s really been a focus for us so that as we spend this capital we don’t have huge lags. Those are the things that we’ll continue to work on but in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi we have very good rate design mechanisms. Frankly in weather normalization the only large state of our 12 states that we don’t have weather normalization would be Colorado and we really don’t need it there. We’re better off without it.
Kim Cocklin: We feel like we’ve done a very good job in the rate arena over the last three years and obviously our focus has been on trying to reduce lag and improve margin recovery and we’ve done it, as Bob said, through WNA and bad debt through gas costs trackers and increasing the recovery of fixed costs or customer demand charges.  That all is going to continue to move forward and we follow the rule that we’re going to partner up with our regulators, particularly in difficult economic times and we feel like that they’ve understood where we’re going , why we’re trying to go where we’re going. We’re going to continue to do that and obviously the biggest issue we have is the level of the return that we’re awarded and have the opportunity to pursue and earn. That’s what we’re working on right now.  Where the economy is there’s you get some support for that but we’ve got, as we’ve indicated, somewhere between $15 and $20 million of what we’re earning and what we could earn if we reached the realized returns that we’ve been provided in the rate levels. Lag is a huge issue but at the end of the day we’re regulated with utility, we’re comfortable with this business and our focus is on reducing all the lag that we can, we’ve done a good job in improving the returns and getting a regulated return that is competitive in the marketplace to attract the necessary capital we need to grow the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: I had a question on your guidance for 2010 for the distribution segment. I’m realizing that you had a few one time items in 2009 that probably won’t repeat. Maybe a little bit more color on why you see the numbers coming down on a year over year basis?
Fred Meisenheimer: Are you referring to a specific page?
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Page 42 the $117 million of net income in 2009 now your new guidance is $109 to $113 million. I’m trying to get a sense of the different drivers that are moving things.
Fred Meisenheimer: We had a tax benefit that we had this year that was a one time item. We had a total of $17 million of one time items, $11 million of which was due to the tax on the deferred tax a 1% change there. That is really a big item that will go away next year, we can’t count on that tax item for next year. That’s really the difference.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: There are higher costs, you have all the rate mechanism where you’ll get the automatic trackers and what not. I’m trying to figure out what else is in that number.
Fred Meisenheimer: We’re basically have flat O&M, costs are not going up, some benefit type costs pension related type things always go up somewhat. We tend to manage and try to offset those through managing our O&M costs. Really the difference in the business is the $17 million of one time items.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Those are mostly attributable to utility?
Fred Meisenheimer: Yes they are.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: You mentioned the interest dates business and how you had I think it was 60% with volume protected in 2010. How does that look in 2011 as you get out there with those contracts, how much rolls off in ’11?
Fred Meisenheimer: Contracts that we have will be expiring in the year 2011. They were three year deals that we negotiated and so they do go into 2011 but the current contracts expire at that point.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: The utility CapEx it looks like its bumping up next year on a year over year basis. What’s behind that, are you expecting a lot more customer growth or is there some AMI in there what in the numbers?
Fred Meisenheimer: This year we had the $33 million at Atmos Pipeline in Texas on the line BP, the Austin lateral, that’s been completed and so that will be an item going away. We spent a good bit of money this year also in our Mid-Tex division on pre-net risers that will be money going away. We have about $40 million of three significant size projects in the pipeline business replacing some compression and dehydration units, there’s three projects there that total about $40 million that will be new for next year.  We also are putting in a new data center here in the Dallas area for our system, that’s in the neighborhood of $9 or $10 million type expenditure next year. Then we are also building a new service center training facility here in the Dallas area that’s in next year’s budget that also will be in the $9 to $10 million range. That basically is what gives rise to the increase in capital for next year.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: The dividend you took 1.5% EPS was up more then that. How are you thinking about your payout ratio and the dividend has only gone up 1% to 2% a year for the last couple year. Where are you thinking you want to do with that over the next few years?
Fred Meisenheimer: Its been higher then what we wanted or we saw in our peer group. If you look back year over year you’ll see it going down about 2% per year. This year ’09 our payout ratio is like 63%. If we hit the middle of our budget next year we would come in with about a 61% payout ratio. We are on the lower end of our desired range we want to be in the low 60% range. We believe we now have that dividend down where we want it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Barry Klein – Citigroup
Barry Klein – Citigroup: Going back to a question on Fort Necessity you mentioned that you didn’t want to develop any more storage. Whatever you do with the Fort Necessity project would that be something that you might be able to lease some capacity for the marketing division to take advantage of that on the marketing side?
Kim Cocklin: Yes, they’re going to be looking for a home for that capacity obviously. There was an open season conducted prior to the application that we filed at the FDRC that issued the certificate. Our marketing group did submit a nomination. Yes, its an opportunity. As Bob indicated while we won’t be into storage development business we continue to grow our market and we continue to have the need to manage supply for a number of our deregulated customers and our non-regulated customers. We always are looking for market priced storage that we can contract for.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: With big declines in industrial margins in 2009 what do you expecting in your guidance for these volumes in 2010? Do you expect flat, up, down?
Fred Meisenheimer: They’re basically flat. We’re seeing some gradual improvement but we’re still thinking its going to be closer to being flat.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: With regard to the utility CapEx the last caller was talking about, will that be concentrated in any service areas? Will it basically, you were mentioning some things about Texas, do you think most of the growth will be concentrated in the Mid-Tex service area?
Bob Best: Yes it will be in the Texas area. We concentrate in those area where we get quicker rate relief on our capital expenditures and try to manage that as best we can.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: On the earnings next year, incremental pension in 2010 should we expect any significant incremental pension expense and any significant pension contributions?
Fred Meisenheimer: As far as expense goes, no, no big incremental expense. For the funding requirements as you know we’ll have to look at on January 1st. This past January when we looked at it we elected to fund it to 94% rate and put $21 million in the pension plans. They have improved considerably this year and improved at an accelerating rate in the third calendar quarter, the quarter just ended September 30 we saw a dramatic improvements in the market and so the market values have improved dramatically.  Interest rates have come down so discount rates have come down but the markets have more then offset that from what we’re seeing at this point in time. We will have to look at it January 1st and do an evaluation to see what, if any, funding requirements would be.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: With regard to the operating cash flow guidance of about $350 million but if you add the net income and D&A it looks like its over $400 million and expected cash flow. Is this a consequence of negative impacts on working capital from the higher gas prices or is this something else that brings me from the over $400 million down to the $350 million?
Fred Meisenheimer: Its the low gas prices that we’ve had have contributed to our improved cash flow and of our increase $500 plus million in our operating cash flow, $360 to $370 million of that we attribute to the decrease in the gas prices and improvements in receivables, payables and inventories.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: You mentioned the regulatory maintenance CapEx level. What is the true maintenance CapEx level assuming that you have no growth projects?
Fred Meisenheimer: We don’t look at it that way. We look at all capital basically is growth capital because we do get it into rates immediately, within 12 months all but about 4% goes into rates within 12 months that’s because of where we spend it, the rate mechanisms that we have and then the time on this with which we file rate cases where we don’t have the annual mechanisms. We get virtually all of our capital into rates within 12 months period and so we consider it all growth capital.
Kim Cocklin: Its investment, its capital investment. That’s what we continue to drive. I talk and educate folks on it. Whatever we do from a capital investment standpoint goes to increase the rate base which is really the earnings engine upon which we generate margins. We increased the rate base we could increase our margins and that’s why we have the $50 to $60 million of assumed rate margin coming in over the next three years on an average annual basis. That’s going put us in the capital appetite range for the regulated businesses about $500 million a year.
Barry Klein – Citigroup: You think that over at least the medium term you think that we could expect capital expenditures in that $500 million.
Bob Best: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vedula Murti - CDP US
Vedula Murti - CDP US: To follow up a little bit in terms of the ongoing capital expenditures given to your modest payout ratio and balance sheet is there any reason to consider over the next two years that any equity will be required?
Fred Meisenheimer: No, we don’t foresee any need for any equity in the next couple of years. Under our capital spending that we have and the cash generation that we do we don’t have other needs for cash, we don’t have any debt coming due until 2011 and then we don’t have any more after that until 2013. We believe that we will be able to fund everything that we need here internally.
Bob Best: Obviously the target cap structure is about $45 or $55 and that’s driven a lot by the regulations with the states. If they don’t recognize or don’t want to reward a real thick equity structure.
Operator: There are no further question at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Susan Giles for closing comments.
Susan Giles: Just a reminder that a recording of this call is available for replay on our website through February 2nd. Also we will be hosting a live webcast next Thursday, November 19th beginning at 12:15 Eastern to provide a more in depth review of our financial performance in 2009 and our key strategies for maximizing value in fiscal 2010. You will be able to access the webcast on our website at www.AtmosEnergy.com We appreciate your interest and thank you for joining us.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-02-04 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles – VP, IR Bob Best – Chairman and CEO Fred Meisenheimer – SVP, CFO, and Controller Kim Cocklin – President and COO
Analysts: Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs Barry Kline – Citi
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 2009 first quarter earnings conference call on the fourth of February, 2009. Throughout today’s recorded presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator instructions) I’d now like to turn the conference over to Miss Susan Giles, President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Susan Giles: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the internet. We have placed slides on the Web site that summarized our financial results. And although we will not review those on detail, we will be happy to take any questions at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please go to our Web site at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Additionally, we plan to file the company’s Form 10-Q later today. With me today are Bob Best, Chairman and CEO; and Fred Meisenheimer, Senior VP, CFO, and Controller. There are also other members of our leadership team here to discuss your questions as needed. And as we review this financial result sand discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Best: Thank you, Susan. Before I begin my remarks, I’d like to just say that yesterday, our Board of Directors appointed Fred Meisenheimer as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller. As most of you know, Pat Reddy left our company on December 31st to become CFO of Spectra Energy. Although we are very glad and excited to have Fred as our CFO, and Fred has tremendous experience in the energy business. And all of us here in the company have terrific confidence in him as we move into the future. So he’ll be giving the financial report this morning as soon as I finish my remarks. And then I’ll conclude with a few remarks at the end. But yesterday, we were pleased to report our first quarter consolidated net income of $76 million, the regulated businesses contributing 76% of that total net income. We’re very pleased with the 25% rise in net income from the regulated gas distribution business from a year ago. The work that we’re doing in a regulatory arena is certainly yielding the results that we have desired, and those results have become more stable and predictable. The regulated pipeline continues to perform very well. The pipeline experienced a 21% rise in gross profits from higher spreads of the through system deliveries. Our non-regulated operations contributed 24% of our net income. Their results include non-cash unrealized mark-to-market net losses of $0.16 per diluted shares this quarter, which Fred will explain in detail in just a moment. But as you know, unrealized margins are temporary and should reverse in future periods. Our strategy of operating efficient and effective regulated assets and offering non-regulated services remains very, very sound. Our earnings contribution had settled in to its more historical mix with about 70% to 75% coming from our regulated business and about 25% or 30% from our non-regulated business. Our operations also generated significantly stronger cash flow than a year ago across all lines of businesses. Also our Board yesterday declared our one hundred-and-first consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2009 is $1.32 per share. I’d like now to comment on our credit and liquidity before turning over the call over to Fred. I’ll remind you that the amount of unused borrowing capacity is affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Our working capital requirements increase as we begin the winter heating season. Traditionally, we access a short term commercial paper market to finance purchases of natural gas to fill our storage fields. As we stated last quarter, because of the unavailability of commercial paper, we borrowed funds from our five-year revolver to meet these working capital needs. However, we have seen improvement in the commercial paper markets recently. At December 31st, the total amount directly borrowed against our line of credit dropped $203 million, compared with $351 million at September 30th. And our commercial paper borrowings increased to $158 million, compared with just $20 million at September 30th. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we strengthened the sources of our liquidity with the execution of two new committed credit facilities. Our liquidity position is strong. As of last Friday, our total available credit capacity included $247 million of available capacity on the $567 million five-year revolver, all of the $212.5 million of capacity on the new 364-day facility, and $287 million on Atmos Energy’s marketing’s $375 million committed facility. In addition, the company has $319 million of outstanding commercial paper with some maturities extend into mid February. And finally, $43 million of cash on hand. Finally, our focus on strengthening our balance sheet and preserving our debt capitalization range of 50% to 55% has been rewarded. Recently, Moody’s revised its outlook on Atmos Energy to positive. And Standard & Poor’s raised its corporate credit rating to BBB+. It is very gratifying for us to receive these positive changes to our ratings, particularly during this time of tremendous disruption in the credit market. It’s now my pleasure to turn the program over to Fred Meisenheimer to review our financial results. And then I’ll return for some closing comments, and we’ll take questions at that time. Fred?
Fred Meisenheimer: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter fiscal 2009 consolidated net income was about $76 million or $ 0.83 per diluted share. This compares to about $74 million or $0.82 a share a year ago. As Bob stated, our regulated natural gas distribution segment reported over $57 million of net income a 25% increase from a year ago. This business benefited from the cumulative effective of rate design improvements and rate increases. An additional $25 million gross profit was generated as a result of rate adjustments primarily in Texas and Louisiana. The Mid-Tex division experienced an $11 million increase in gross profit as a result of the three-year rate settlement reached in 2008 of all the cities other than the city of Dallas. Additionally, natural gas distribution gross profit benefited by about $8 million from a non-recurring update to our estimate for unbilled revenues as a result of base rate changes in several of our jurisdictions. The regulated transmission and storage segment did about $8 million of net income, down about $2 million from the same period a year ago. Gross profit increased by almost $10 million due to increased through deliveries as well as improved margins. During the quarter, we were able to take advantage of spreads between our interconnects at the Waha and Katy hubs despite the over $3, compared to about $0.50 the same period one year ago. Higher position increase was more than offset by planned maintenance expense. The non-regulated pipelines, storage, and other segment posted almost $6 million of net income, up about $4 million from this time a year ago. Earnings were higher mainly due to increased transportation margins and utilization of excess transportation capacity available under asset management agreements. Non-regulated natural gas markings segment experienced a decline in reported net income of about $11 million or about 49% from the same period a year ago. This was primarily due to the negative mark in our storage book at the end of the current period. Such are many moving parts to the marketing business, let’s look at gross profits for this segment. If you turn to slide number eight in the slide deck, you can see that gross profit margins declined quarter-over-quarter by almost $16 million. That’s comprised by a $54 million decrease in unrealized margins, offset by $37 million increase in realized storage and trading margins. $37 million improvement in our realized asset optimization margins in the current quarter is a result of realizing net gains from settling financial contracts and withdrawing storage during the quarter. These gains were captured as unrealized in prior periods. As we discussed on our year-end conference call in November, AEM had been deferring storage withdrawals and resetting their financial instruments in the last half of fiscal 2008. And hence, the potential realized gross profit in future periods. As a result of unfavorable natural gas fundamentals this period, it was economically advantageous to settle financial contracts and cycle gas from storage to realize the economic value at the current quarter. This contrasts to the prior year quarter where it was advantageous to leave the gas in storage and roll the financial pages forward, which were ultimately cycled into the second quarter of fiscal 2008. This $37 million improvement in the realized asset optimization margin was offset by $54 million decrease in unrealized margins. First, the decrease reflects movement from unrealized margin in the prior year into realized margins of about $37 million in the current quarter. Secondly, market spreads, that is cash versus floor prices on AEM’s positions, decreased by almost $0.54 per MCF in this year’s first fiscal quarter, compared to a decrease of about $1.81 per MCF in the same period last year. Let me remind you that the mark-to-market impact in this GAAP financial values are temporary and should reverse in future periods as fiscal gas is again cycled from storage and the related financial hitches are settled. Information concerning AEM storage book is shown and appendixed [ph] to the slide presentation on slides 32 to 34. These slides show the difference between the economic value, it is the cash, which is what we use to manage the business and the GAAP reported value at the end of our reported period. Primarily as a result of realizing the economic value in the first quarter, AEM’s economic value associated with the storage book decreased from $48.5 million at the beginning of the current quarter to $20.7 million at the end of December. Based on the current setup at December 31st, we expect to realize about $10 million of this economic value in fiscal 2009, primarily in the second quarter, then the remainder in fiscal 2010. Spreads were about $0.97 per MCF at December 31, 2008, compared with about $0.64 per MCF at December 31, 2007. As a reminder Atmos Energy Marketing maintains a flat trading book and does not engage with speculative trading. Looking at our expense side of our income statement for the quarter, consolidated OEM expense rose $13 million. Primary drivers in the increase include about $9 million due to hired contract labor, largely related to a planned maintenance of Atmos pipeline in Texas. About $6 million in increased employee and administrative costs and as a partial offset to these increases, bad debts expense decreased about $1.3 million, compared to the same period a year ago. Also of great work in fiscal 2008, we entered the 2009 with our heating season with the ability to recover the fuel related portion of bad debt expense through gas cost tractors. This accounts for about 64% of the total budgeted gas costs at the regulated distribution business. This means we could collect the gas cost portion of bad debts or gas costs recovery tractor avoid incurring it as an expense. As a result, our projected bad debt expense for fiscal 2009 has been reduced to $12 million, which is considerably lower than the $16 million experienced in 2008. Interest charges in the current quarter rose about $ 2 million, compared to one year ago. We had higher average short term debt balances. But moreover, we experienced a higher average commercial rates of about 7.25%, compared to a lower 5.5% of the same quarter one year ago. Also commitment fees for our lines of credit increased. Current commitment fees range from 7 to 50 basis points, compared with eight to nine basis points last year on our short term credit facilities. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $107 million, up $13 million from the same period a year ago. This increase reflects spinning from non-regulated growth projects and increase regulatory compliance spending in the Mid-Tex division. We have affirmed our fiscal 2009 earnings per share guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 per diluted share, and have updated the expected contribution by business segment. So let me draw your attention to slides 23 and 24 where we have outlined our budget assumptions of net income by segment for fiscal 2009. Our projections there included $ 8 million increase to net income in the regulated gas distribution segment, with an equal and offsetting decrease in the non-regulated marketing business. Distribution business continues to perform very well. We believe outcomes from our rate design work should provide stronger earnings power in this segment. Additionally, the distribution business has benefitted from a one time $8 million increase of margin, which is about $5 million after tax. That’s from our refining our estimates for our unbilled revenue. We continue to expect lower margins in the non-regulated marketing business based on our viewpoint of relatively low volatility in the natural gas market in fiscal 2009. Marketing margins will likely fall at the lower end of the estimated range. As a reminder, the guidance range assumes no material mark-to-market impact at September 30th, 2009. As you can understand, we have no way of determining what that mark will be until the end of our fiscal year. I’d like to take a minute to review our defined benefit pension plan given what has transpired in the financial markets. Despite the recent decline in fair value of plans assets, we were not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plan during fiscal 2008. However, based on the January 1st measurement date, we expect to fund at the 94% level as permitted by the new ERISA funding requirements. This would require a contribution of less than $25 million to our plans by September 15th, 2009. We’re projecting between $500 million and $515 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009. Of that, $345 million to $355 million will be maintenance capital, and about $155 million to $160 million will be growth capital. As we said last quarter, in our effort to conserve cash and avoid a reliance on credit facilities, some of these projects could be delayed. In response to this action, we’ve modified our CapEx for fiscal 2009. Growth capital has been revised downward from our original projections. You can refer to slide 28 for the current breakdown. Major growth CapEx requirements now include about $73 million to $75 million in regulated distribution growth projects throughout our service territory. $50 million to $55 million from the project closed to Austin, Texas on the regulated Atmos Pipeline Texas system. And $20 million to $22 million in non-regulated projects, which include $6 million for the Shrewsbury acquisition we announced back in October, and $15 million to $16 million for Fort Necessity. With respect to Fort Necessity, in January we executed an option to purchase 240 acres and lease 320 acres putting our total investment at about $12 million at the end of December. Drilling of the test well is complete, and evaluation of salt cores is in progress. We’ll be configured to service a cavern well up on FERC 7C certification. In November, we filed a FERC 7C application, and anticipate the certificate by May of 2009. As we’ve previously indicated, we’ve engaged the services of an investment bank to help us determine our optimal ownership development mix for this project. We want to mitigate the market risk associated with the project of this scale and scope as well as gain assurance on the availability of capital as we move forward. We’ll continue to provide updates on this long term project in the future. That concludes my remarks so I’ll turn this over to you, Bob.
Robert Best: Thanks, Fred. I’ll take a few – make a few closing comments, and then we’ll take questions. As we’ve just said – Fred and I have just reported, we’re off to a good start this year and are encouraged by our earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We realized considerable progress in our distribution operations and have rate cases pending. In October, we filed a rate case in Tennessee seeking an increase of $6 million. In November, we filed a $9 million rate case with the city of Dallas, which is the only city in the Mid-Tex Division not to agree to the settlement we’ve reached in 2008 with 438 other cities served by the Mid-Tex Division. And in December, we filed a TransLa annual rate stabilization clause for $1 million in Louisiana. This ongoing rate work is critical to the future financial performance of our gas distribution segment. In the regulated transmission and storage segment, the through system business continues to be very strong. There are a few small projects under review to add capacity enhancements in the growing areas of our service territory. This month, we expect also to make a filing under Texas Script legislation to recover 2008 capital expenditures on the Atmos Pipeline Texas system. Our non-regulated operations will continue to complement the regulated businesses through the marketing segment’s more predictable delivered gas services revenues. The pipeline, storage, and other business should provide additional income from its storage and transportation activities. We continue to review our capital and expense budgets to determine what steps may be taken to conserve cash. We certainly believe that we can balance the need to providing our shareholders with stated earnings growth without jeopardizing the safety or reliability on the distribution and pipeline systems. We’re off to a great start with solid first quarter earnings, ample credit to operate our business, and improved credit ratings. We’re certainly pleased with the start to 2009, and I appreciate you taking time to be with us this morning. That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll be glad now to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session. (Operator instructions) One moment please for our first question. And our first question is from Ted Durban with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Question on the O&M side up $13 million or $14 million. I’m trying to get a sense of how much of that is expected to be recurring? It seems like a lot less is on the pipeline and how much money will be more one time?
Fred Meisenheimer: O&M is one time in that we did a lot of maintenance type work on the pipeline in the first quarter. We had opportunities to do that. And so a lot of that spending we accelerated into the first quarter on the pipeline operations. And so we believe that will level back out more in line with our budget for the year.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: So it’s related to the expansion or is just an ongoing maintenance that needed to catch up on?
Fred Meisenheimer: Ongoing maintenance that we needed to catch up on.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Okay. That’s fine. On the non-regulated growth CapEx coming down just from your – it looked like $25 million or $30 million. Is that mostly coming out of Fort Necessity or are there other projects that you took out of the budget?
Robert Best: That is a – it’s a combination of both, Ted, and looking for the highest and best use of our capital. So we’ve reduced what we’re going to be putting in Fort Necessity plus put some other projects potentially on hold.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Can I ask about then just about volume growth? It looks like the distribution companies and volumes were up 6%. How much of that was due to weather? And maybe can you give a little color on what you’re seeing on different segments like industrial demand? A lot of folks talk about industrial demand being off.
Kim Cocklin: Good morning, Ted. This is Kim.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Hi, Kim.
Kim Cocklin: Yes. A lot of that is related to weather. As we take – obviously experienced some weather patterns in our service territory early in the heating season, and obviously December and January. That’s simply what we’re seeing. Obviously, you’re seeing some contraction in the commercial, industrial sector right now. And that may continue as this economy continues its course.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: So when you talk to your customers do they give you a sense that you’d come out of this in the second half of the year or – where are they talking to you about that?
Kim Cocklin: Depends if you’re watching CNBC or Fox or anybody in New York. Really, on the residential side, which is the lion’s share of our service and associated volume, we have weather normalization that covers about 97% of that stuff. The commercial side, I mean it really isn’t that much of a big part of our business; most of it obviously in the Kentucky mid-states area. And those folks they’re looking very optimistically at the second half.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more on rate cases? Can you remind us what the rate increase that you actually have in ’09 rates are in Mid-Tex? And then also in west Texas I thought you’d filed for a $9 million or $10 million rate increase there?
Kim Cocklin: Well, the best way to look at that probably is we keep a running total of the revenue additions that are associated with actual rate outcomes. And if you look at 2008 we added about $54 million of additional revenue from cases that we successfully concluded during that period. So far in ’09, we have brought in about $23 million of additional revenue. And we have cases on file seeking amounts of $16 million. And then we have another – planned filings that we will make during calendar ’09 amount right now to about $61 million. That we’ve got, obviously, a very aggressive approach to our rates and trying to keep our expenses in line with our filings and keeping everything current so we can address and reduce as much lag as possible.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: I’m sorry. The $61 million that you’re planning to file, that’s system wide? Not just Texas?
Kim Cocklin: All those things are system wide.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: All of it. Okay. That’s great. And then if I could just – one last question in terms of the short-term debt balances. They picked up $150 million versus where you were at this time last year. Is there a plan to be out there more in the debt markets of longer-term debt? Or how are you thinking about the mix of short and long term debt and other financing (inaudible)?
Fred Meisenheimer: We’re looking at options as you are well aware. We have the $400 million that comes due October ’09 and we’re looking at activity out in the market now. Rates are continuing to improve from what we’re seeing and we’re looking at our options as to what we have available to us and what we will do during the year. And so that will – time – we’ll come to conclusions on that as we go through the year. But as of now we don’t have – haven’t finalized those plans.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: And would you need any equity at all beyond a standard trip that you do every year?
Robert Best: No. Ted, this is Bob. No, that’s not in our plans at the moment. We’re really – we’ve gotten all of our credit facilities in place and, as Fred said, we’re looking at the timing of this $400 million. But no, we’re not – our balance sheet’s pretty much where we want it to be. And so we wouldn’t be looking at any equity.
Ted Durban – Goldman Sachs: Okay. I appreciate the time. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our next question is from Barry Kline with Citi.
Barry Kline – Citi: Hey. Just piggy-backing off one of the last speaker’s questions, you were talking about planned filings of $61 million system wide. Over what territories would that be?
Robert Best: I guess you’re talking about the rate case filings this year. Okay.
Kim Cocklin: That’s over everything, Barry. We got some actions we got to pursue in Missouri, the pipeline grip. Mid-Tex obviously won the settlement. We have further discussions to go there. Down in Louisiana, west Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois, Colorado and Kansas.
Barry Kline – Citi: Okay. That basically–
Kim Cocklin: How about that?
Barry Kline – Citi: Also, gas is probably put into the ground at pretty high prices compared to historical numbers. What type of working capital cash flow should we see for the rest of the year? Or at least going into the summer – or going through the rest of the heating season versus previous years?
Robert Best: Our cash flows have been very strong as you’ll see in our numbers for the quarter. We have been pulling a good bit of gas out of storage and cycling that gas. And we are – debt balances are in good shape. And we have done things within the company in improving our cash flows just from daily operations and the way we bill and collect our monies. And so our working capital funds are in good condition at this time and believe that we’ll continue with that throughout the year.
Barry Kline – Citi: What I was getting at is that they should improve because you’re taking out some high cost gas that you’re passing on to customers.
Robert Best: That’s correct.
Barry Kline – Citi: How much of an improvement in working capital could we see in the next three to six months compared to other years because of this turnaround? And should that impact – and how much should that impact the short term debt balances that people have been talking about that are pretty high now?
Robert Best: Our short term debt balances are going down and will continue to go down. We anticipate they will be substantially reduced in the next very few months, and largely due or in part due to cycling the gas out of storage and recouping that money from the customers.
Barry Kline – Citi: Okay. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions). And as there are no further questions, I’d like to turn the call back to Management for any additional remarks.
Susan Giles: Thank you all for joining us this morning. As a reminder, a recording of the call is available for replay on our Web site through April the 30th. If you have any additional questions please call me. Again, thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Good day.

===== 2008 Q4  (2008-11-12 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Giles - VP, IR Robert W. Best - Chairman and CEO J. Patrick Reddy - Sr. VP and CFO Kim R. Cocklin - President and COO Richard A. Erskine - President, Atmos Pipeline - Texas
Analysts: Schneer Kruschuni - UBS Barry Klein - Citigroup Ted Turbin - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Atmos Energy's 2008 Fiscal Year and Fourth Quarter Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts, and it is being webcast live over the internet. We have placed slides on our website to summarize our financial results. We will not review them in detail, but we will be happy to take any questions at the end of our remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the Conference Call link. With me this morning are Bob Best, Chairman and CEO; and Pat Reddy, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. With that I will turn the call over to Bob.
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Susan and good morning everyone. And as always we appreciate you joining us this morning for our call. Our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Reddy is going to review our financial results in greater details in just a few minute, but before he does that I'd just like to start up by saying we're extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal year 2008. We were able to earn $2 per diluted share, an increase of 4.2% from last year, again meeting our commitment to deliver average annual earnings growth in the 4% to 6% range on a per share basis. In fiscal 2008, our regulated operations contributed 74% of the total net income, while the non- regulated operations contributed the remaining 26%. It truly reflects a return to our more historic earnings composition. Also, we are extremely proud of achieving a significant milestone for our company despite the uncertainty in the financial markets in our economy. Yesterday, our board of directors declared our 100th consecutive cash dividend, which was also our 21st annual dividend increase. Annual dividend was raised $0.02 bringing our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2009 to $1.32 per share. Our debt capitalization was 54.6% at the end of fiscal 2008. We keep this ratio on our list of top priorities and stand committed to preserving a debt capitalization range of 50% to 55% and maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings. These fundamental business principals have served us well during this time of disruption in the credit markets. On October 29th, we secured a $212 million 364 days committed revolving credit facility. This facility replaced the $300 million facility that expired October 29th, 2008 and includes two new participating banks. But also like to make some observations about our credit liquidity before turning the call over to Pat. Our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our working capital requirements ratchet up as we head into the winter heating season. We typically access the short-term commercial paper market to finance purchases of natural gas to fill our winter storage. Because of the freezing, the CP market beginning in mid-September, we drew down $331 million under our five-year revolver to fund these working capital needs. Our short-term debt outstanding is about $200 million greater at September 30th, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily driven by a reduction in operating cash flows in fiscal 2008, largely due to the rise in gas prices experienced during the summer injection period. At a consolidated level, our weighted average cost of gas and storage was $8.40 at September 2008 compared to $6.78 the same time a year ago. Our debt level is expected to peak by the end of January and then start to decline as our customers begin paying their winter heating bills. Our liquidity position remains very strong. We have credit facilities in place to meet our working capital needs and as of last Friday November 7th, our total credit capacity included $168 million of available capacity on the $600 million five-year revolver. All of the $212 million of capacity on the new 364 day facility and 213 million on Atmos Energy's 580 million uncommitted facility. In addition, the company has 171 million of outstanding commercial paper with some maturities that extend into late January. And we also have $97 million of short-term investments and cash on hand. We could potentially experience some near term earnings pressure as a result of these challenging conditions. As a result, we are reviewing our capital and expense budget to determine what steps there need to be taken to conserve cash and avoid reliance on credit facilities. We would not, however, jeopardize safety or reliability on our distribution in Pipeline systems. I will now ask Pat Reddy to review our financial results and then I will return for few closing comments and we will take your questions. Pat?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, thank you, Bob and good morning everyone. My remarks will primarily focus on the fiscal year and at the end of that I will touch on our earnings guidance for fiscal 2009. I'll begin with the regulated operations. Our natural gas distribution in Texas intrastate Pipeline businesses combined the regulated operations experienced 24% growth in net income that's compared to a year ago. Continued execution of our rates strategy coupled with higher throughput in per unit margins that Atmos Pipeline, Texas where the primary drivers of the growth and income. Our non-regulated operations experienced a drop in net income of about 25% from one year ago. If you turn to slide number 7 in the slide there, you can see the earnings decline because of reduced realized margins on asset optimization activities mainly due to lower natural gas price spread volatility, which we have witnessed for sometime now. The natural gas marketing segment experienced the declining gross profit for the year of about $11 million as compared to last year, mainly due to continued compression of market spreads as I just mentioned. The largest driver of this segment's decrease was the result of AEM' s decision to defer storage withdrawals and reset the corresponding financial instruments, which should enhance the potential gross profit in future periods. This caused financial hedge settlement losses without the corresponding storage withdrawal gains, resulting in lower gross profit from realized asset optimization activities of about $35 million. Additionally, AEM experienced year-over-year increases in storage demand fees charged by third parties. The decrease in asset optimization was partially offset by a year-over-year increase in delivered gas margin of over $16 million, which was driven by an increase in consolidated gas sales volumes of about 18 Bcf or 5% compared to last year and an increase in per unit margins due to favorable basis gains and improved marketing efforts. And finally, unrealized gains increased $7 million mainly as a result of the narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices. Additional information concerning AEM storage book is shown on the appendix to the slide presentation beginning on slide number 51. This shows the difference between our economic value, which is what we use to manage the business and our GAAP reported value at the end of the reporting period. At the end of September, the excess value of our gas and storage was about $12 million, which we expect to realize primarily in the first half of fiscal 2009 based on our current injection withdrawal setup. There is a more detailed discussion of economic gross profit and potential gross profit in the MD&A section of our 10-K, which should be filed by the end of next week. As a reminder, Atmos Energy marketing endeavors to keep a flat trading book and does not engage in speculative trading. Now, I will turn to the expense side of our income statement. For the year, our operation and maintenance expenses rose about $37 million mainly due to the following factors: first, higher employee and benefit cost increased O&M expenses by about $7 million largely due to salary and headcount increases across all operations. Our contract labor rose about $8 million primarily due to project spending at Atmos Pipeline-Texas. Other administrative cost rose over $6 million for the year and authorization and vehicle fuel cost increased O&M by almost $6 million in fiscal 2008. We also experienced a rise in outside legal fees of about $9 million year-over-year due primarily to an increase in both litigation, and rate and regulatory activity. Our bad debt expense in a regulated gas distribution business decreased about $4 million compared to last year mainly due to continued focus on collection. In fiscal 2007, operating expense included charges of about $6 million, which did not recur this year. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 rose about $80 million to $472 million. This mainly reflects cost associated with the automated metering initiative in the gas distribution segment, main replacement activity in our Mid-Tex division, and capital to the non-regulated Park City gathering project. Please refer to our conference call slides for more detail on our capital expenditures. Moving now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2009, we have affirmed our fiscal 2009 earnings per share guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes no material mark-to-market impact at September 30, 2009. And, as you can understand we have no way of determining what the mark will be until the end of our fiscal year. So, let me draw your attention to slides 37 and 38, where we have outlined our budget assumptions and net income by segment for fiscal 2009. This has not changed since we provided it originally during our Analyst Meeting on October 1st. Some of the assumptions that underlie our budget include continued successful execution of our rate strategy and collection efforts. No material impact from mark-to-market of our physical storage and offsetting financial hedges; short-term interest rates is well above three and three quarters percent; no material acquisitions; normal weather conditions, which is less impactful for our distribution operations now, but can affect our regulated pipeline and limiting our bad debt expense to no more than $12 million. It's important to note that as a result of the rate, where we accomplished in fiscal 2008, we're heading into this 2009 winter heating season with the ability to recover the fuel related portion of bad debt cost to purchase gas adjustment mechanism in Amarillo, West Texas Cities, Lebec, Tennessee, Virginia, Kansas and our Mid-Tex jurisdiction, which all when combined account for approximately 67% of the total budgeted cost to gas and a regulated distribution businesses. This means we can now defer the gas cut portion of bad debt cost above the amount included in base rates in the above mentioned jurisdictions. I'd like to spend just a minute on our defined benefit pension plan, given what is occurring in the markets. Despite the recent decline in the tier value of the plant assets, we were now required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plan during fiscal 2008. However, we will monitor this situation in light of market conditions to determine if any contributions are required in 2009. Our next measurement date is January 1 of 2009. We are projecting between $510 million and $525 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009, of that $310 million to $338 million will be maintenance capital and about a $180 million to $187 million will be growth capital. The growth capital includes $50 million to $55 million for a regulated project close to Austin, Texas on the Atmos Pipeline-Texas system. As an update on this project, it is proceeding with preconstruction work and includes acquisition of writes away; permitting et cetera and a pipe has been ordered with delivery expected in early February. And we have another $50 million targeted for non-regulated projects including $30 million for identified that is yet unnamed project. As Bob said earlier, we are reviewing our capital and expense budget to determine what steps can be taken to conserve cash and avoid reliance on credit facilities. Therefore, some of these projects may be delayed until after the 1st of the year, but we are committed to ensuring Atmos will continue to deliver the guide in investors expect even in these difficult markets. And that concludes my remarks and now once again here is Bob.
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Pat. I will make a few final comments and then we will be glad to take your questions. As we have outlined today, we feel very good about our achievements that we accomplished this past year. We increased our earnings, preserved our debt capitalization target, received possibly positive outcomes in the regulatory arena and completed the non-regulated Park City gas gathering project in Kentucky. Additionally, our proposed non-regulated Fort Necessity stall salt-cavern gas storage project in Louisiana is progressing. In July, we completed a non-binding open season, which reflected significant interest in the project. Drilling of the test well is now complete. The core sample has been extracted and is currently being analyzed and as we indicated at our October 1 Analyst Meeting, we have engaged these services of an investment banker to help us determine the most optimal ownership development mix for this project. We work to mitigate the market risk associated with the project of this scale and scope. As well as gained assurance on the availability of capital as we move forward. We will continue to update you as milestones or math for this long-term project. Our regulated pipeline, Atmos Pipeline-Texas, continues to perform well. There are a few projects under review that would increase capacity to meet potential demands associated with the continued development of production in Texas as well as capacity enhancements in the growing areas of our service territory. As you know, the foundation of our business lies in the regulated distribution business. Execution of our rate strategy is paramount to achieving our financial objectives. This past year we made considerable progress in the Mid-Tex division. We reached settlements with 438 of 439 cities served by Mid-Tex on terms that everyone felt good about. That settlement is for three years and includes the mechanism, which provides us the ability to refresh rates annually to reflect changes in cost, revenues and capital. In April, we made the initial RRM filing with the settling cities for 33.5 million on a system wide basis. We negotiated with these cities and reached agreement on 20 million, which went into effect on November the 1st. Last week, we filed a rate case with the City of Dallas, the only city in the Mid-Tex division not to agree to the settlement earlier this year. The rate case for Dallas is approximately $9 million. We have proposed that these rates become effective on December 11. If Dallas chooses to suspend the case, the statutory deadline will be March 11 of next year. We requested a return on equity of 11.7%. This filing affects over 220,000 customers. We have several other cases currently pending with plans to file others in fiscal 2009. Over the five-year budgeting horizon, we project normalized revenue increases of about $50 million to $60 million annually from our rate outcomes. We recognized consistency, predictability and growth report, and all of these attributes will be our focus as we move forward. We appreciate you taking time with us this morning and now we will open it up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Schneer Kruschuni with UBS. Go ahead please.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Hi, good morning.
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Schneer.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Guys, can you hear me now?
Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Now, we can.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Perfect. Sorry about that, we had some phone difficulties. Just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions, just with respect to the utility, I know that you have made significant amount of progress with respect to immunizing yourself from weather exposure and so forth and what not. I was wondering if you can talk to the effects of conservation, I know that you got something in Mid-Texas and so forth but if you can sort of give us some color with respect to your exposure to conservation in this type of environment?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'm going to let Kim Cocklin, who is here with us and is our President of our company answers that question.
Kim R. Cocklin - President and Chief Operating Officer: Good morning, Schneer. Well, as you know conservation tariffs are very popular discussion topic with regulators today and it's pretty similar to the demand despite management that goes on as one on the electric side. We do have conservation programs. We have one in the Mid-Tex division and we are adopting one in West Texas and essentially, it encourages our customers to conserve and it rewards us with joining with them in these efforts to have them conserved and then our margins are not high essentially to throughput.
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And Schneer, another thing that we benefit from it about 75% of our margins today are reviewed in annual rate filing mechanisms like we have in Texas, the other jurisdictions Louisiana and Mississippi, so that to the extent that conservation could accelerate we wouldn't have to... it wouldn't be a significant lag between the time that develop and the time that we could reflect the declining volumes and rates.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Okay. That makes sense. Can you also give us some color with respect to your historical experience with bad debt expense, I mean, going back let's say at '91 or some more severe recession scenarios than we've seen recently?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We had kind of high water mark for bad debt expense in the winter of 2000-2001, where at we hit...we were approaching about 2%. And since then, we have worked hard to reduce our bad debt expense by taking maximum deposits, by charging reconnection fees to customers and cutting off customers for non-payment before they have burned through their deposit. And as a result, we're running at less than one half of 1% today. Now of course we're all concerned with the current economic conditions that our customers may have more difficulty in paying all of their bills, credit cards and utility bills and we're certainly in the middle of all of that. But we have a very effective collections team in place and good trackers in our terrace. We also talked in our release about the effect that we have made significant progress and being able to recover the fuel cost portion of bad debt expense in our terrace, which for us 85% of our bill.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Okay. Two last questions here, one is you brought up the pension plan until foot in the 2009 or what not. Is there some sense or some thought process out there to potentially make a total contribution at this point right now, just given the fact that assets are down and obviously the market is down in it, and that it may potentially recover before you make the contribution so forth and can you take advantage of that?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we took our snap shot at September 30th and we were 98% front at that point. Obviously since then the markets trailed-off in October. And as we looked at early numbers as of October 31st, we are about 89% funded and under the Pension Protection Act, you don't want to be really below 94% funded on a measurement date. Our next measurement period is January 1 and we will take a look at that point to see if we are below the 94% level and think about whether we want to make a contribution to the plan, the concern you have is if and when the market does come back, it puts you in an over-funded position that we will certainly look at that. Based on the snapshot at October 31, the amount of under-funding to get to 94% will be about $16 million. So, it's not an over whelming amount, it is just that the current liquidity situation we prefer not to be making voluntary contributions. We do have all the way until I think October 1st of 2009 to make additional funding. So, we will watch it during the year and watch the markets and make decisions as we go.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: And the final question more housekeeping, if you can just give us here for the fourth quarter the mark-to-markets that you have effectively burned the margin on or not, earned the margin on and so forth that would in theory can be reversed with the non-cash impact rather?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: At the impact on an earnings per share basis for the quarter was $0.11 compared to $0.12 last year and for the full-year, the mark-to-market impact between the marketing segment pipeline storage was $0.20 compared to $0.14 last year.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Is the $0.11 broken up between the pipeline and the trading business?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, $0.03 for pipeline and $0.08 for natural gas marketing.
Schneer Kruschuni - UBS: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Barry Klein with Citigroup. Go ahead please.
Barry Klein - Citigroup: How is it going, guys?
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning.
Barry Klein - Citigroup: Schneer asked a few of my questions, but staying on the topic of the pension expense, does that annual review that you have with I think you said it was Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Does it include an annual review for any increases in the pension expense or funding necessary?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's an element of our overall cost to service, and so pension expenses included in the review.
Barry Klein - Citigroup: Okay. How much would 1% change in the discount rate effect your expense... your pension expense?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question. I don't have that on my finger tips, but let me think about that well around the call here.
Barry Klein - Citigroup: Okay. And that's it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.
Ted Turbin - Goldman Sachs: Hey guys, just coming back to the net non-regulated the marketing margins and what not, I am trying to figure out, if I back out the $0.20 of benefit that you got from non realized margins this year, its at $0.14. It looks like that sort of core operations are down pretty significantly. But you have said I think in the past that you don't really budget for unrealized margins. Can you just give us a sense where you see that coming on 2009, just given the weak trends you had in 2008? And then the other question on that is I just noticed that your net acquisition of down to 8 Bcf, which looks like its pretty low versus where you've been over the last many quarters. Maybe just talk about what is the commercial activity you're seeing? Is that being reflected in the physical position or not?
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Rick, would you like to address that?
Richard A. Erskine - President, Atmos Pipeline - Texas: Absolutely. We are at 8 Bcf as you pointed out at the end of fiscal 2008, but we are re-injecting in order to sit our economic values for next year. We have recognized $36.4 million of our economic value of $48.5 leaving us $12.1 million. As Ted pointed out in his remarks, we expect that $48.5 million based on our current sit-up to be realized in primarily in the first quarter of 2009. And the remainder of that in the second quarter of 2009. And its rally, not unusual for us to have these unrealized gains as we set our positions for the following periods and then we are re-injecting as I mentioned, so that we can have additional economic value. And again, it's not unusual to recognize those in income before we actually get the cash.
Ted Turbin - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on CapEx and thinking about the pipeline business, you have seen a lot of E&P companies like [indiscernible] and what not flashing their CapEx budgets and I'm just wondering how that might translate for you in terms your growth projects on pipeline and storage, something like that?
Kim R. Cocklin - President and Chief Operating Officer: Ted, this is Kim. Obviously, as Pat and Bob indicated in their opening remarks, both capital and expense budgets are being reviewed almost on a daily basis right now to keep in contact with the economic climate. And we have had conversations with several folks in the Barnett Shale and the producers that we do business with. And, while we are still having a very, very good...we have a good situation with our throughput, they are backing away from certain projects in the very near term related to expansion of capacity right now and further development given where prices are. So, some of those things have been deferred and delayed. They're not totally shelved, but they are deferred and delayed.
Robert W. Best - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And interestingly, in our fiscal 2009, few of our capital projects are earmarked for additional throughput across our Atmos Pipeline-Texas system. We have got some reinforcements that we are doing at the southern end of our system down near Austin, Austin lateral to beat up our ability to deliver gas down to that portion of our system. And that's not really dependent on the producers drilling program. We have identified as Kim said, probably something on their order of $30 million to $40 million of CapEx that could be slipped beyond January 1 without really hurting the effectiveness of those programs. So, as Kim said those are things that we are looking at pretty closely.
Ted Turbin - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we have no further audio questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Giles for any closing statements.
Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Well, thank you all. Just as a reminder, recording of this call is available for replay on the website through February, the 4. We appreciate your interest and thank you again for joining us. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect. .

Operator: Welcome to the Fiscal 2008 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call on 6 of August 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now hand the conference over to Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Susan Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Good morning, everyone, and thank you f joining us. This call is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analysts. It is being webcast live over the internet. We've placed slides on our website to summarize our financial results. We will not review them in detail, but we will be happy to take any questions at the end of our remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the Conference Call link. Also, we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later today, which will also be available on our website. With me today are Bob Best, Chairman, President and CEO; and Pat Reddy, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team with us to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Bob Best. Bob?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Susan, and good morning everyone. And as always, we appreciate you joining us today and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. As Susan said, Pat Reddy will review the financial results in greater detail in just a moment. But before he does that, I want to talk about several of our recent business developments. Yesterday, after the market closed we reported improved financial results for both our third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2008. For third quarter, we reported a net loss of about $7 million, a 51% improvement over the net loss of $13 million in the same quarter a year ago. On an EPS basis, that equates to a net loss of about $0.07 per diluted share compared to the net loss of $0.15 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. For the nine months, net income was up slightly year-over-year to almost $179 million. As you know, due to the seasonality of our business, primarily the regulated distribution business, fiscal third and fourth quarters are typically characterized by costs that exceed revenues. The regulated businesses, comprised of our gas distribution operations and our Texas intrastate pipeline, experienced solid net income growth over last year of 78% for the quarter and 22% for the nine months ended June 30. Net income from the nonregulated businesses declined 17% quarter-over-quarter and for the nine months, net income dropped 43% from the same period a year ago. Also yesterday, our Board declared our 99th consecutive cash dividends. Our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2008 is $1.30 per share. I want to spend some time talking this morning about the Mid-Tex rate case we filed last September of about $50 million As you may recall, the case has been settled with all cities in the Mid-Tex Division with the exception of the City of Dallas and the unincorporated areas representing about 20% of the Mid-Tex customers. On June 24th, the Railroad Commission of Texas issued its final order on the litigated case with the City of Dallas and unincorporated areas. The components of the final order include a $19.6 million system-wide annual rate increase, the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debt expanse, an authorized return on equity of 10%, an improved capital structure of 52% debt and 49% equity, and a conservation program with cost share between customers and the company. Final order did not include a Rate Review Mechanism unlike the settlement cities. We will continue to make annual GRIP filings to recover capital expenditures and file traditional rate cases as necessary, seek recovery of increased expenses. In fact, in May, the Mid-Tex Division made a 2007 GRIP filing on a system-wide basis of $10.3 million. In November, we anticipate implementing about $2 million annually for the customers of the City of Dallas and the unincorporated areas since they do not have the Rate Review Mechanism. For the settlement cities representing approximately 80% of the Mid-Tex customers, the Rate Review Mechanism filing is pending. First Rate Review Mechanism filing was made in April, requested an adjustment to rate of about $33.5 million. The cities are currently reviewing the filing and after some negotiation and ultimate agreement, implementation is scheduled for October 1, 2008. On our nonregulated side, our nonregulated Park City Gathering project in Kentucky is now complete and fully operational. This is a 23-mile low-pressure gas gathering system and treating facility. Total project cost is almost $12 million with about $9 million of capital spent in fiscal 2008. In the first year of operation, net income is expected to be about $1 million, but the longer term value of this project is that it should give us a foothold in a much larger regional strategy. Last month we completed an non-binding open season for the Ft. Necessity salt-dome gas storage facility located in Franklin Parish, Louisiana, with optimistic and favorable results. Our open season participants requested storage capacity that in total was more than three times greater than the 5 billion cubic feet of capacity proposed in Phase I of the project. The first cavern is projected to be operational in 2011 and the other two caverns in 2012 and 2014. Drilling in the test well began on June 30th and is expected to be complete by mid-October. We anticipate full evaluation of the salt core by mid-December. This well will be configured to serve as a cavern well upon FERC 7C certification. I'll now ask Pat Reddy to review our financial results. Then will return with a few closing comments and will be happy at that time to take your questions. Pat?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Bob, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call. For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we experienced a sizable improvement over the same quarter a year ago, as Bob mentioned. Our reported net loss was $6.6 million or $0.07 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of $13.4 million or $0.14 per share a year ago. For the nine-month period, net income rose 2% to about $179 million or $1.99 per diluted share compared with $174 million or $2 per share for the same period a year ago. For both current periods, the regulated natural gas distribution business continued to benefit from the cumulative effect of changes in rate design in several of our service areas. We still experienced a net loss of $12 million at the distribution business this quarter, that is a 21% improvement from the same period a year ago. In the current nine-period, distribution net income climbed to over $113 million, a 23% improvement over last year. The regulated transmission and storage segment experienced terrific growth. Net income grew 67% to $10.2 million in the quarter and 21% to $35 million in the current nine-month period. This segment continues to benefit from increased transportation and higher per unit margins from the Barnett Shale gas producing region of Texas, as well as GRIP recovery of annual capital expenses in Texas. Together, the regulated businesses experienced year-over-year growth in net income of 22% contributing $149 million in the current nine-month period. Nonregulated operations experienced a net loss of about $4.5 million in the current quarter, a decrease of about 17%. For the current nine months, the nonregulated operations posted almost $30 million of net income. However, this was down about 43% from the same period a year ago. Earnings continue to be reduced in the quarter and year-to-date, mainly due to reduced realized margins on asset optimization activities due primarily to a decrease in natural gas price volatility. If you now turn to slide 6 and 13, you can follow along as we take a closer look at the nonregulated natural gas marketing segment. Natural gas marketing's gross profit decreased about $2 million for the quarter and $26 million for the nine months as compared to same periods one year ago. Realized asset optimization margins decreased $4 million quarter-over-quarter. During the current quarter, AEM realized about $37 million of losses compared to about $33 million of realized losses in last year's quarter. During the current quarter, AEM elected to defer storage withdrawals and reset the corresponding financial instruments to enhance the potential gross profit in future periods. As a result, AEM realized financial hedge settlement losses without the corresponding storage withdrawal gain, which contributed to the loss of about $37 million of realized asset optimization margins. In the prior year's third quarter, AEM realized financial hedge settlement losses without the corresponding storage withdrawal gains because the storage had already been withdrawn in the fiscal 2007 second quarter; i.e., ahead of the original planned schedule. That's contributing to the realized loss of about $33 million in last year's third quarter. Let's turn now to our fiscal 2008 nine-month period, where our natural gas marketing gross profit was about $26 million lower tan in the same nine months last year. The biggest driver again was in the realized asset optimization margin, which decreased $49 million period-over-period. During the current nine months, AEM realized about $10 million of loss compared to about $39 million of realized gains last year. Due to the less volatile natural gas market we experienced this entire year, AEM has been regularly deferring storage withdrawals and resetting the associated financial instruments, in other words, rolling them forward. As a result, AEM recognized settlement losses without corresponding storage withdrawal gains throughout the current fiscal year as we just discussed for the third quarter. Additionally, AEM experienced increased storage fees charged by third parties. This is in sharp contrast to last year where AEM was able to recognize arbitrage gains as changes in its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans had a significantly smaller impact. Partially offsetting these losses are the increases we have experienced in our delivered gas margins of about $1 million in the current quarter and about $11 million in the current nine months, largely attributable to higher per unit margins in both periods as a result of favorable basis gains and a 14% increase in gross sales volumes for the year-over-year nine months. Unrealized margins also increased about $1 million quarter-over-quarter and about $12 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of the narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices. Information concerning AEM storage book is shown on the appendix to our slide presentation and it begins on slide 38. You can see that the difference between the economic value, which is the measure we use to manage the business and our GAAP reported value at the end of the reporting period. At the end of June, the potential gross profit, which is future economic value not yet realized in GAAP reported results, of our gas and storage was about $14 million, which we expect to realize primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 if our optimization efforts are executed as planned. Spreads climbed to about $2.75 per Mcf at June 30 compared to $0.52 per Mcf at the end of March 2008. As a reminder, Atmos Energy marketing attempts to always maintain a flat trading book and does not engage speculative trading. There is a more detailed discussion of economic gross profit and conventional gross profit in the MD&A section of our 10-Q, which, as Susan mentioned, will be filed later today. Tuning now to the expense side of our income statement, our consolidated operation and maintenance expense increased almost $3 million in the current quarter and about $17 million in the nine months period. The primary drivers of the increase include: higher labor and benefits costs associated with annual wage increases and higher contract labor increases of about $1 million in the quarter and $4 million in the current nine months. Other administrative cost rose about $1 million in the quarter and about $3 million in the current nine-month period, and pipeline authorization and vehicle fuel costs increased O&M by almost $4 million for the current nine months. Our current nine-month period is impacted by the absence of about $4 million last year from the deferral of 2005 and 2006 Katrina-related expenses, which we were allowed to recover by Louisiana Regulatory Commission and which were reflected in the first nine-month period of last year. We also experienced a rise in outside legal fees of about $5 million for the current nine-month period. Our bad debt expense decreased about $4 million in the current nine months, mainly due to a continued focus on collections. Year-to-date, our bad debt expense remains at about three-tenths of 1% of revenues, and we anticipate that no more than 15 million of bad debt expense will have to be recognized in fiscal 2008. Looking at our capital expenditures for the nine month, they rose about $15 million to $313 million; this primarily reflects cost associated with the automated metering initiatives in our gas distribution segment, main replacement activity in our Mid-Tex Division, and capital to the nonregulated Park City gathering project that Bob discussed. Turning now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008, we are maintaining our previously announced estimate for fiscal 2008 in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 per diluted share of common stock. However, we are fine-tuning the expected contribution by business segment. We are quite pleased with the performance of the distribution and pipeline operations and are gratified that our continued focus on rate design is improving our financial results. In addition, Atmos Pipeline-Texas continues to perform very well. Year-to-date APT has transported 30 Bcf more than originally planned, while also capturing higher per unit margin on incremental transactions. So, let me draw your attention to slide 31 where we have projected an increased contribution from the regulated segment and a reduced contribution from the nonregulated businesses. We are increasing expected regulated net income by $11 million to $12 million with an equal and offsetting decrease in nonregulated net income. $10 million to $11 million of the decrease comes from the natural gas marketing segment where we continue to expect relatively low price volatility for the remainder of the year. Our guidance range assumes no material mark-to-market impact at September 30, 2008. However, as you know, there is no way to predict today what the mark will be until the end of our fiscal year. We are projecting between $455 million and $465 million in CapEx in fiscal 2008. Of that, $350 million to $355 million will be maintenance capital and about $105 million to $110 million will be growth capital. And with that, I will turn it back to Bob.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Pat. We will make a few closing comments and then will be glad to take your questions. As you heard today, we have a good foundation and the diverse foundation of assets. We continue to realize substantial progress in our regulated distribution and Texas pipeline operations, and we are really encouraged and uplifted by the reports you just heard from Pat about the performance of our regulated entities for the first nine months of fiscal 2008. I think this shows the progress we have made and the effectiveness that we've had in our rate making process in every jurisdiction that we serve. On our nonregulated operation side, it really does complement the gas distribution business. And although as you heard, the income from the marketing storage has dipped because of the lack of gas price volatility, the natural gas marketing segment continues to provide solid earnings growth through its more predictable delivered gas services revenues. Looking forward, we are finishing up our fiscal 2009 budget cycle and will be communicating those details to you in the coming months. Any of you may be asking what's next for Atmos Energy, but with Mid-Tex essentially fixed, how can we grow our distribution business? Well, I would just say that much of the work that we've been doing over the past few years with rate design and rate filings has now paid off for us and we will continue to make incremental improvements in our regulatory assets as we move forward. With the Texas pipeline, we have several projects that are under review as we explore opportunities with all of the drilling going on in the state, and particularly in the Barnett Shale. And we hope that we will be able to announce one of those projects in the near term. Certainly, it's an exciting time to be operating the pipeline in Texas. Prospects for our Fr. Necessity Storage Project are also promising as we reported today, and although it's still in the early stages, we will continue to update you as it progress. Again, we anticipate the first phase to be operational in 2011. We appreciate you taking time to be with us this morning and now we will be glad to open it up for any questions that you may have. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. The first question comes from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys. On the Mid-Tex rate request, what are the key issues that are sort of going on now like there is some negotiations and what's the process, can you talk us through that?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: This is Bob. I'm going to let Kim Cocklin who runs our regulated operations answer that question for you.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Good morning. Well, the process, I think, we've had several conversations with a lot of... it's an expedited, abbreviated approach to reviewing the capital investment and the expense increases. We were now seeking $33.5 million. And as a matter of fact, we are having meetings today with one group of cities and we have already had two meetings with the other group of cities. So, the process is probably going to be about two to three meetings and we anticipate settling on a dollar increase and that increase will be reflected in rates that will be made effective with our fiscal year beginning October 1.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: So, if I think about what are the big issues that are likely to be part of the negotiations?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Well, there really aren't any big issues because we stipulated to return cap structure, depreciation, there is the normal discussion, and to-date about what expense levels are appropriate. There really... there is no difference actually with us and the settling parties on our capital investment. Most of it is associated with the O&M expenses. And if you follow the rate cases that's in the Texas Railroad Commission before, you know that we've had a lot of issues around shared services, corporate costs that are allocated to the divisions, and how the level of costs that should be allocated. So principally, the shared service was corporate costs that we are talking to them about right now.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, if I could ask about the Ft. Necessity project, did you get a sense of pricing that you might see out of that based on the open season, you have got producer demand, but just a sense of what the sort of the demand curve actually looks like for the project?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm going to let Mark Johnson who runs our nonregulated operations to answer that.
Mark H. Johnson - Senior Vice President, Nonregulated Operations, President, Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC: Yes, Ted, we had a strong turnout of bidders and we didn't get a good sense of pricing, pricing was consistent with all of our market research ahead of time. We had a good range, a good diversity of people interested, entities interested taking [ph] down capacity. And it was encouraging to see that there was still a robust need for additional storage capacity. So, yes, the open season served its purpose, and we are going to move forward with the project on a very conservative basis and begin discussions with those entities, and be sure that we draw a line as to what are our expectations on it.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, can you just talk a little bit about construction costs? Have you sort of started to talk to vendors about they would be doing and then also about potential returns on the project?
Mark H. Johnson - Senior Vice President, Nonregulated Operations, President, Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC: Well, the construction costs, we were fortunate enough, we have already begun our stratographic test well and the virtual [ph] well, which we were fortunate enough to lock in the drilling costs for that over nine months ago. And those costs are something to be concerned with. But we have got a pretty good handle based on all the information out there today. Our costs are current, and that's all factored in as we start to look at what the economic viability of the project is. At this time we are not going ahead with any kind of economic forecast, but we are discussing it with the parties that are interested in that capacity.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ted, this is Pat. As you can imagine, we have run a whole bunch of different scenarios with various levels of construction costs, various expectations about needs for storage injection and withdrawal cycles, and different levels of extrinsic and intrinsic value. So, obviously, we wouldn't be going forward with it if it wasn't meeting our internal hurdle rates, which, as we have discussed on earlier calls, tend to be about 15% after tax for nonregulated projects.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: That 15% unlevered or --?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Unlevered.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It's actually Barry Klein. A couple of questions on the marketing division, the estimates for the year, I think are $27 million to $30 million in net income, you had said that the... you thought that there was going to be low price volatility for the rest of the year. Has this number been updated from previous quarters or... and does this assume sort of normal type of volatility, or is this assuming the lower volatility for the rest of the year?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: This is Rick Alford, who is Head of the financial part of our nonregulated operations.
C. Richard Alford - Senior Vice President Finance & Administration: This number has been updated. Our original projections and even our revised projections had no material storage contribution in the fourth quarter. So, we really didn't have to update that part. This is standard operations on our marketing book, primarily that's generating these numbers.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I don't know if you said it during the call, do you know what type of impact the... deferring those withdrawals versus the prior year should have, or is that, I don't know if you've released that or not?
C. Richard Alford - Senior Vice President Finance & Administration: Well, what we do every month and every quarter, we evaluate our economic value, which is our future income that we expect from our storage operation. And then we also have a GAAP number we have in our slide, the $13 plus million of future economic value. So that's the way we track the impact of our resetting the financial positions.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got you. Thanks a lot.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Elvira Scotto from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Elvira Scotto - Bank of America: Hi, good morning.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Elvira Scotto - Bank of America: Question on your distribution businesses. What's the driver behind raising your guidance for distribution and what gives you the confidence that you can hit these higher numbers? And then, just as a follow on, I know that on bad debt expense, you haven't seen much of an increase in the quarter despite a big jump in natural gas prices. But what's your view, as we head into winter, particularly given sort of the current macro backdrop, and maybe you can run through your different operations and talk about, if you have any riders in place for bad debt expense that would be helpful. Thanks.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm going to let Kim Cocklin answer you question. But I wanted to say something about bad debt expense first and that is, we have been started back really in the winter of 2001 when gas prices spiked and we put a special emphasis on our collections activities, and I think that has really helped us through the last seven or eight years to keep our bad debt expense where it is. And so that... we had to really give some accolades to those who work in that area because it's a daily... every day you have to just stay right on top of the situation. So, I think we've really performed at a very high level when it comes to bad debt expense. But as far as the operations and why we feel confident about our regulated operations for the rest of the year, I am going to let Kim Cocklin answer that question. Kim?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Well, thank you, Bob. Well, I mean, obviously we are relatively confident that we are going to make the number and principally it's related to a lot of the rates, the regulatory activity that began about two to three years ago and the annual filings that we make now in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia, and some of the successes that we've had in the past in Kentucky and Tennessee that are now starting to show up on an entirely annual basis. And I think if you look at the incremental revenue that's been added in the past 12 months from rate and regulatory activity, it amounts to about $67 million of additional margin that is coming in this year that has not been coming in in the past. And obviously, we have filings that are in process right now that have filed for amounts that we'll obviously negotiate down and that's... some of that's included. And then we have other applications that are in the process stage. I mean, as Bob and Pat have continually emphasized, I mean, the road for success with the regulated business is obviously in the rate and regulatory world and it's not only the processing of the applications that are necessary to reflect the net capital investment and the expense increases that we're incurring, but also it's very dependent upon the relationships that we have established. Pat talked about the RRM processes in Texas. And we are confident that that is going to work and work very well, principally again because of the relationships and the amount of the investments that we made on those relationships, not only with the customers, but also with the city officials as well as legislators and then the regulators themselves. So that's really where we are at and that's why we are enjoying the success that we are reflecting in the results. And it's more of a collaborative partnership, and things that are being litigated. And the other upside to all of this is that there is significant savings associated with rate case expenses that's being occurred as part of the litigation that has been going on in the past. So, I know that's a the long way around it, the bottom line is that we're confident that the numbers are very achievable.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And our pipeline has been doing really well with all the volumes that it's been transporting, which is part of the regulated operations.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Yes, that pointed out, I mean, the volumes that are going through the Barnett Shale field right now that have increased significantly. I think we are 70 Bcf over last year and we are also significantly above the margins that we were realizing through that same transportation because of the bases spread that are existing in the Barnett Shale and where that pipeline is situated.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Kim, on that point, our transportation volumes and margins are expected to be about $9 million higher than we planned. And so we factored that into our guidance in the mix of the earnings contribution.
Elvira Scotto - Bank of America: Okay, thank you, that's very helpful. I just wanted to go back to the bad debt expense. Do you have... I am just thinking about going into this winter, heating season, do you have riders in place, in case you do have, you do see some increased bad debt expense?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We do have, I mean, several states. That's one of the things that we are working on in the rate process everywhere we file, but Kim, why don't you mention --
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Well, I hope, Elvira, that you are very accurate and correct that we are going to have a winter heating season this year for a lot of reasons. But we have, in most of the bigger divisions, I think it's about 50... at least 50% of the jurisdictions or the meters are covered with the recovery of bad debt in a PGA type mechanism rather than in the rate level. So, it's an actual recovery of the gas cost piece of bad debt rather than trying to establish a representative level and hitting that mark and trying to assign an assumption around gas prices. So, we have significantly reduced our exposure. In the Mid-Tex settlement in particular, that was the significant condition in the settlement that we would get the recovery of gas cost portion of bad debt in our gas cost recovery filing that we make in Texas. We have it in West Texas as well and we have it in Tennessee, Virginia and Louisiana.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Elvira, going back several years, we have done some blocking and tackling around, making sure that we can charge customers appropriate deposits and reconnection fees. We're very diligent about going through the disconnection process for customers that don't pay their bill and so that we can have them offline before they get too far into our pocket. And so you are never happy about that process, so we are very diligent to control bad debt expense.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I will say this, I mean, our collections efforts in our area for collections, I mean, we have a group that's responsible for collections internally, and they do a magnificent job. I mean, if you look at us compared to the rest of the industry, we are incurring bad debt of about 0.34%... 0.34% of overall revenues. So, 3.34 of 1%. [Multiple Speakers] 1%, which is magnificent given obviously the economic conditions requirement. But it's something that's focused on everyday and we have got people that go to bed and wake up thinking about collections, they do a wonderful job.
Elvira Scotto - Bank of America: Okay, great, excellent. Thank you very much.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Thank you, Elvira.
Operator: Thank you. There appears to be no further questions. Are there any further points you wish to rise.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Atmos Energy fiscal 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This call, as you know is open to the general public and media, but designed for financial analyst. It is being webcast live over the internet. We’ve placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will not review those in detail, but we will be happy to take any questions at the end of our prepared remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Also we plan to file the company’s Form 10-Q later today. With me today are Bob Best, Chairman, President and CEO; and Pat Reddy, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are also other members of our leadership team with us here to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. With that I’ll turn the call now over to Bob Best.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Susan and good morning everyone, and as always we appreciate you joining us and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. As Susan mentioned, Pat Reddy will review the financial result in a greater detail in just a moment. But before he does, I want to talk about our business and recent developments regarding the company. Yesterday, we reported second quarter consolidated net income of $112 million in earnings per diluted share of $1.24 per share. In the regulated businesses made up of our gas distribution operations and our intrastate pipeline in Texas, we experienced a 13% increase in our quarterly net income year-over-year. Distribution business continues to benefit from regulatory enhancements at further stabilized margins, and our pipeline in Texas benefited from the recovery of prior year capital expenditures through the GRIP mechanism, as well as higher transportation volumes generated from increased natural gas drilling in our state. And as expected year-over-year results in our non-regulated businesses declined this quarter as lower gas price volatility continued to limit our arbitrage opportunities in the marketplace. But our strategy of combining complimentary regulated and non-regulated operations continues to yield positive results. Our earnings contribution is projected to return to a more historical mix at about 70% coming from the regulated business and the other 30% coming from the non-regulated businesses in 2008. Also our Board declared our 98th consecutive cash dividend. Our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2008 is $1.30 per share. I want to now about the Mid-Tex rate case, and the status of that case that we filed last September. That case now has been settled with all cities except Dallas, which accounts for about 15% of our customers. It is very significant that not only have we settled at about 70% of our customers, half of the commission is also supporting the settlement for what we call our advanced [ph] customers, which represents another 15%. As part of the continuing efforts to settle with the City of Dallas, the rail road commission of Texas order mediation which the first day of mediation occurred yesterday and we continue to talk to Dallas, and we are going to have follow-up meetings in an attempt to reach a settlement that’s fair to both parties. The next milestone in the rate case occurs May 16 when the proposal for a decision is due. And then we would expect accent a settlement, a final decision at the end of June. But I want to say this, that the settlement represents a dramatic paradox shift in how we do business in the Mid-Tex Division. It encourages and facilitates a collaborative and even cooperative partnership with our customers. Traditional rate filings are going to be replaced by a mechanism which streamlines the rate review process and annually updates capital expenditures and expenses. In addition, to establishing the foundation to improve and strengthen customer relationships, the review mechanism incorporates agreement on traditional divisive rate issues including ROE, capital structure, depreciation rates and allocation of shared service cost, which should significantly improve the stability, reliability and predictability of revenues and margins during the term of the agreement. The opportunity to review, challenge and better understand the content of these annual filings is presented during quarterly meetings that will be held to review and discuss expense budgets, operational plans and capital projects. And these meetings should provide the oversight that the cities desire, while giving them an opportunity to better understand our rates, our service and the value that Atmos brings to all of its customers in the State Of Texas. Now I want to turn to several important projects that we have been working on and have mentioned in previous calls. Our Park City Gathering project in Kentucky is nearing completion. This is a 23 mile low-pressure, gas gathering system and treating facility. Construction is completed and testing is currently being conducted, and we expect to be fully operational later this month. Total project cost for the Park City project was $10 million with $7 million of the capital spend in fiscal 2008. In the first full year of operation, pre-tax returns were expected to be about 20%. But the longer term value of this project is that it should give us a foothold in a much larger regional strategy. Now turning to our salt-dome storage project in Louisiana. In early, February we announced, we had submitted a pre filing request with the FERC to construct and operate a salt-cavern gas storage project in Franklin Parish located in North Eastern, Louisiana. Because the facility will store and facilitate transportation and natural gas between states, the FERC will have regulatory oversight, over this project. Potentially this is for an initial build out of three 5 Bcf caverns for a total of 15 Bcf of working gas storage with six-turn injection and withdrawal capabilities. The structure could accommodate an additional four caverns depending on market demand. The first cavern is projected to be operational in 2011 and other two caverns in 2012 and 2014. We have now secured a contractor to drill the test well and drilling is expected to begin some time next week. This well will be configured to serve as a cavern well upon FERC 7(c) certification. We expect to announce a non-binding open season in our fiscal third quarter. Our fiscal 2008 capital budget includes about $15 million for this project. With any project of this scale and scope, there exists a long destination period. At this time with the project being in it’s infancy, it will take some time before we can develop or disclose any meaningful related financial metrics. I’m now going to turn program over to Pat Reddy to review our financial results and then I’ll return for closing remarks and then Pat and I as well as the rest of the team will be glad to take any questions from you, Pat?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Bob and good morning every one. We are looking forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Financial Forum. I’ll speak to the more significant items in this quarter and our six months period, and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. As we stated in the earnings release, our consolidated net income for the quarter climbed 5% to about a $112 million or $1.24 per diluted share and for the six months ended net income dip slightly to $185 million or $2.06 per diluted share. The main drivers of our earnings results were the following. Our regulated natural gas distribution segment grew net income 12% in the quarter to about $86 million. Net income grew 16% to $126 million for the current six month period. For both current periods; the National Gas Distribution business continued to benefit from cumulative effect of rate design improvements. We experienced a net increase in gross profit of over $13 million in the quarter and about $23 million for the six month period generated primarily from rate adjustments in several of our areas. The Regulated Transmission and Storage segment experienced remarkable growth. Net income grew 15% to $15 million in the quarter and increased 9% to $25 million in the current six months. This segment continues to benefit from increased transportation in the Barnett Shale and Carthage gas producing regions in Texas, as well as some GRIP recovery at the annual capital investments in Texas. Our nonregulated operations contributed net income of almost $11 million in the quarter, which was down about $7 million from the prior year’s quarter. Year-to-date, the nonregulated operations posted over $34 million of net income, down about $22 million from the same period one year ago. Earnings were lower mainly due to a decrease in realized margins on asset optimization activities resulting from reduced gas price volatility. This decrease is consistent with our view at the beginning of our fiscal year that we express here regarding marketing margin that they would decline as a result of reduced price volatility. Although both nonregulated segments of our business were affected by the lack of natural gas price volatility, my remarks today will focus on gross profit in the natural gas marketing segment and you can follow on if you’d like by turning to slide 6 and 13 in our deck. Natural gas marketing gross profit was down about $7 million for the quarter and $24 million for the six months, as compared to the same period one year ago. Unrealized margin losses decreased about $31 million in the quarter and $11 million for the six months, mainly as a result of smaller changes in the spreads between the forward prices that are used to value the financial hedges and the market price used to value physical storage. Operationally, we experienced an increase in our delivered gas margins of almost $12 million in the current quarter and $10 million for the current six months, as compared to a year ago. This was largely due to the ongoing successful execution of our marketing strategy, which generated incremental sales volumes of about 19 Bcf in the current quarter and 37 Bcf for the six months along with capturing favorable basis gains in both periods. Our asset optimization margins declined $15 million in the quarter and $45 million in the six months as compared to last year. This decrease was due to smaller gains realized from the settlement of financial positions, lower margins earned from cycling gas in a less volatile gas market, and increased fees paid to third-parties for storage. You may recall that during last quarter, natural gas fundamentals were less than favorable with warm weather and national gas inventory levels nearly full. At that time, the marketing company elected to inject gas into storage and roll its financial positions forward, primarily to this fiscal second quarter, in order to take advantage of the favorable spreads that existed at that time. During our fiscal second quarter, Atmos energy market essentially executed on its December 31, 2007 planned injection and withdrawal schedule by cycling gas from storage and settling the associated financial contracts. During the process, the marketing increased its net physical position by 3 Bcf. However, the captured spreads were lower than in prior periods. Information concerning the marketing company’s storage book is shown the appendix to our slide presentation and it begins on slide 38. It shows the difference between, what we call, economic value and the GAAP reported value at the end of the reporting period. At the end of March, the excess value of our gas and storage was about $11 million, which we expect to realize primarily in the second quarter of next fiscal year that would be fiscal 2009. Spreads fell to about $0.52 per Mcf at March 31, 2008 compared to $2.49 per Mcf at the end of December 2007. Now, let’s turn to the expense side of our income statement. Our consolidated operation and maintenance expense increased about $8 million for the second quarter and about $14 million during the first six months of our fiscal year. The primary drivers of the increase were: higher labor and benefits costs associated with annual wage increases and higher contract labor, which increased almost $2 million in the quarter and nearly $5 million in the current six month period. In the current quarter, there was also a reduction and the accrual for incentive compensation at the nonregulated business segment as a result of lower earnings this year. Other administrative costs as well as pipeline odorization and vehicle fuel cost increased O&M by about $5 million for the quarter and $6 million for the current six months. We also had an absence of about $4 million in both the current quarter in six months from the deferral of 2005 and 2006 Hurricane Katrina related expenses allowed by Louisiana regulators in the prior year quarter. We also experienced a rise in outside legal fees of about $3 million for the current six months. As a special offset to these increases, our bad debt expense declined about $2 million in the quarter and by over $4 million in the six months as compared to same period a year ago, mainly due to a relentless and continued focus on collection of customer accounts. Year-to-date our bad debt expenses running about three-tenths of 1% of residential and commercial revenues, and we anticipated no more than $15 million of bad debt expense this fiscal year, down from prior estimates of $20 million. Looking at our capital expenditures. For the current six months, they rose about $26 million to $199 million. Primarily, reflecting cost associated with pilot programs for our automated metering initiative in the gas distribution segment, pipeline main replacement activity in our Mid-Tex Division and the Park City gathering project that Bob talked about in Kentucky. Turning now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008. Despite the changes in the composition of our earnings this year, we are maintaining our previously announced earnings estimate in the range of $0.95 to $2.05 per diluted share of common stock. Earlier, Bob discussed the rate case settlement in the Mid-Tex Division and it’s a reminder. We’re not assuming any material impact on earnings in fiscal 2008 from its final outcome. And that’s primarily because of the increase we put in affect last April is recovered volume metrically. So of rather heating season and we will be into our summer and fall months. However, our assumptions for the 2008 fiscal year do include total expected gross margin contribution from the marketing segment in the range of $19 million to a $100 million, excluding any material mark-to-market impact continues successful execution of the rate strategy in collection efforts and our distribution utility, bad debt expense of no more than $15 million, average interest rates on our short-term debt about 6.5% and no material acquisitions in the balance of the year. On a consolidated basis, we remain within our original guidance range. But now that we are halfway through the year, we are better able to refine the split between our business segments. So let me draw your attention to slide 29, where we have project an increased contribution for the regulated transmission and storage segment and decreased contributions from nonregulated segments. We are projecting between $450 million and $465 million of capital expenditures for fiscal 2008. We have a breakdown in our slide deck. Of that $325 million to $335 million will be maintenance CapEx and about a $125 million to $130 million will be growth capital. And with that I’d like to turn it back to Bob.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Pat. And I’ll make a few closing comments and then we’ll be very happy to take questions. We don’t talk a lot about our solid investment credit. I’d like to remind you that maintaining our credit rate is extremely important to us and it’s certainly essential for financing growth and operating our businesses more efficiently. Our debt capitalization ratio at March 31st was 50% compared to 52% one year ago. We worked hard to return to our traditional 50% to 55% range after integrating the TXU gas assets and operations and feel good about where our balance sheet stands today. Additionally, we have no short-term debt outstanding at the end of March, which is where we want to be as we head into the storage injection season. Operationally, we continue to realize progress and are very focused on our regulated operations and particularly, the rate activity that goes on in our states. In the gas distribution business, we currently have rate actions filed and pending in Kansas, Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Virginia and Georgia service areas. We certainly, as I said, remain focused on effective rate making and effective rate design. We talked earlier about the settlement in Mid-Tex, but let me give you a few more details as we close. Settlement includes initial rate increase to revenues on a systemwide basis of $10 million, which was implemented April 1st. This is being recovered as past debt [ph] through the volumetric piece of the rate, so it will have no sizeable impact, on our 2008 earnings. Settlement also includes an annual Rate Review Mechanism or an RRM as we call it, effective for a three-year trial period that provides for annual adjustments to rates including both a true up to revenues for the prior rate period and the setting of prospective rates to include known and measurable costs for the next year. Beginning October 1, we will lower the base customer charge to $7 from $10.69 for the residential customers. We will adjust billing determinants and consumption to the previous year’s actual throughput experience. The gas cost portion of uncollectibles will be recovered through the purchased gas cost adjustment. Conservation program has also been approved to be funded equally by customers and the company. The first RRM filing was made April 14 requesting an adjustment to rates of $19 million and a true up to rates of $13.8 million for a total requested increase to rates of $33.5 million. (Inaudible) are currently reviewing the filing and after negotiation and agreement, implementation is scheduled for October 1, 2008. As I said earlier, we hope this marks the beginning of a new collaborative and cooperative rate making environment for Atmos and its customers in the state of Texas. In the regulated transmission and storage segment, the through-system business continues to be strong. Atmos Pipeline-Texas is uniquely positioned in the Barnett Shale production basin, which obviously is one of the hottest onshore supply basins in the country. Pipeline traverses and feeds our Mid-Texas utility, which in turn serves sprawling DFW Metroplex. Its capital investment is recoverable through the annual rate mechanism in Texas and it benefits from market based tariffs earned, and transportation gas from producers drilling in the Barnett Shale field. 2007 GRIP filing for revenue increase of approximately $7 million was implemented on April 15th of this year. Pipeline also provides reliability for the Mid-Tex Division distribution customers, yet is strategically positioned to serve the growing producer needs in Texas. Our non-regulated operations continue to complement the gas distribution business. As we have said on this call, we anticipated some pullback in our gas marketing and storage income from the lack of gas price volatility. But the marketing group is increasing sales volumes and continues to evaluate expanding into new market areas. The non-regulated natural gas marketing segment should provide solid earnings through its more predictable delivered gas service revenues with some upside from the storage optimization business. Non-regulated business development strategy is pretty simple. Stick to areas in which we are confident and in which we have a lot of expertise. The Park City Gathering system in Kentucky gives us a foothold into a much larger regional strategy. And as I talked earlier, the fourth necessity salt-dome storage project in Louisiana is still in its infancy. There are a lot of unknowns at this time which make it extremely difficult to model that project at this time with any amount of precision. To get closer to the startup date, we will give you better idea of the financial metrics associated with this project. And finally, I would like to add that assuming we achieve the middle of our earnings guidance of $0.95 to $2.05 for fiscal 2008 on a fully diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis, we will have grown 6% over the past five years, which is at the upper end of our stated annual earnings range, of 4% to 6% on average. This earnings growth coupled with our dividend yield of 4.5% gives us the opportunity to provide our shareholders with exceptional value. We will continue to do that as we continue to grow our earnings in that 4% to 6% range. We appreciate you taking time to be with us and we will now open it up for any questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Ted Durban [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Hi guys. Question for you on the Mid-Tex case? I am trying to understand the adjustment of the $33.5 million that you are talking about for the next phase. How much of that is… I understand that part of that will be your CapEx recovery? Submit [ph], what you have as a GRIP filing, but now you are going to be getting O&M and what not. How much of that 33.5 would have been CapEx including GRIP and how much of it is more in the expense side and things like that?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Good morning, Ted. This is Kim Cocklin. The GRIP bounced to about $10.2 million or that part of the filing that would have been associated with GRIP is about $10.2 million, and the $13.8 million represents the true up of the revenues that were generated during the period compared to the 9.6 ROE and the capital structure that was agreed to, and remainder is principally expensed.
Operator: And he has dropped out of the queue. [Operator Instructions]. And we’ll put Ted Durban back in the queue. Please go ahead, sir.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Yeah, sorry about that.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Welcome back Ted.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Hey I don’t know what happened there. Just wanted to know the forward… it sounds like it’s forward-looking for O&M, that’s as of… is it of fiscal 2009 or is it of sort of when you filed it in April 14?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: We utilized the period ending December of last year as the base period.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And Kim, when we make that filing can we take into… It will be non-measurable going forward.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Yes.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Yes. Okay. So can you give an estimate of sort of what do you think you’ll earn ROE basis for 2008 and then presumably you’ll earn your 9.6% ROE in 2009 if you get the full filing requirement?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: If we would get the full filing requirement, that would be the outcome. We expect to have a process of negotiation and compromise any other case. So I mean, this is the first step of a three year trial period and obviously we want everybody to have a good understanding of where we are going and there will probably be give and take associated with this initial filing for sure.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Okay.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: I don’t know what the returns are going to be in next year. If you know that, that would be helpful for us.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then if I could ask a question just on the Fort Necessity Storage Project, what kind of interest are you seeing and what sort of commerciality are you seeing, given where the project is? Have you had to kind of… and not in an open season, obviously but just kind of spoken to producers and what not?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: Well, we are very encouraged by the interest in the project. The location in Louisiana is downstream of some bottlenecks and a lot of other projects. So the location is good. It’s very proximal to a handful of interstates, which brings in more players that are interested in participating. The interest has been very encouraging. It gives us a lot of options because the interstates that we have an opportunity to tie to a couple of different regions, which also add to the attractiveness of a storage facility of this make, of this size and in this location. So far so good, as far as all the steps that have taken place to date and the open season should be forthcoming here shortly. Not binding open season.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And if I just could… one more question, probably for Kim, how far along are you in terms of getting regulatory approval for the AMI spending in the various jurisdictions?
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Regulated Operations: We have sought recovery of those amounts in both of the jurisdictions where we have begun the pilot program, Ted. So, they are included in filings that are before commissions.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: So, you’ll do a pilot of...
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We are doing a pilot of 70,000 customers right now. We did it in the McKinney, Texas area which is part of the Mid-Tex [Utility] Division. And then we also did it in the Louisiana, part of the Louisiana Division.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: And this will be reviewed and accessed in the next year so or?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the timing on Louisiana is around June, our recollection and then the Mid-Tex will be part of the process that we’re undergoing right now.
Ted Durban - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ted.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Beaumont with Copia Capital. Please go ahead.
Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital: Good morning. A couple of quick clarifications on something set me on most meeting. One in particular, is you had the expectation of increased LNG shipments and that that those were going to be positive, I guess, just seeing some structural things, do you still feel that maybe the case for this summer?
Mark S. Bergeron - Vice President, Gas Supply and Services: This is Mark. At this point, it’s pretty hard to predict LNG shipments coming in this summer. We don’t see a lot of LNG terminal operators locking up lot of supplies. But it is a function of what the market drivers are and what’s happening in Europe, main is competition for LNG. More LNG arrivals on our shores would probably increase the volatility in the gas market, with gas prices jumping up around $11, and continue to rise. We’re in the world market, so we think that there is an opportunity for LNG to come but obviously it’s hard to predict its arrival.
Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital: Okay. Thanks. And I guess, its on bad debt you guys have done an extraordinary job keeping it down. I know you’ve had increased collection activities. Just given where most of the utilities are seeing in problems, do you expect to see a lower increased understanding you’ve given not more than $15 million for the year. But just given we’ve come through the heating season and so (inaudible) past due or what have you in given housing markets another residential issues, do you expect to see an increase there?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we’ve been working on our uncollectibles really with a tremendous focus on that since 2000 when gas prices spiked in. I think our goal has always been to be at one half of 1% of commercial residential revenues or less. I think we’re seeing our good work this year, but that good work has almost been a cumulative affect because as I say we’re very focused on making sure we stay on top of our own collectibles. So there are obviously higher gas prices do put pressures on uncollectibles and we do other things nationally such as push for more dollars for live heat, which is a [low in term] housing allowance. And we work closely with agencies to help people that cannot pay their bills. So we’ll just continue to be very focused on and as I say we know that some other things that are going on the housing market and the -- and also with their gas prices will put -- it’s going to put increased emphasis on it. But it’s something that we really work hard at staying on top of it. And our people are very passionate about it. It takes a lot of labor to be able to reach the marks that we have and we’re very appreciative with the good job that our people do.
Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital: And one last thing in Texas obviously we had some warmer than normal weather. It was pretty normal last year. Is the weather norm mechanism Mid-Tex working? How do you expect?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Eric this is Pat, it actually worked very well, as part of the ongoing sort of fine tuning and negotiation of this RRM. We are making some technical changes and really it doesn’t change the total amount we collect, it just changes how it falls among our various classes of customers. But overall, it really has helped us remarkably. And as we come out of the heating season, Bob mentioned the fact that we don’t have any short term debt. Part of that has to do with rate increases that we put into effect, but a big part of it relates to this better rate design that we had at Mid-Tex and in Louisiana and in Mississippi, that’s about 75% of our customer margins that are now effectively normalized for weather, and we’ve got a second winter under our development, it’s working very well, really as intended.
Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital: Great. I appreciate the time when we see you guys in Miami.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Brooke Glenn Mullin with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Brooke Glenn Mullin - JPMorgan: You mentioned that you were seeing higher storage costs. Can you give us a sense of whether your storage portfolio is close to market or should we see continued cost pressure on that side going forward?
C. Richard Alford - Senior Vice President Finance and Administration: This is Rick Alford, Brooke. We are currently experiencing probably about $1.8 million a month in storage demand charges. As you can see from our table in the appendix, we have about $0.52 per Mcf in our economic value. At this point we feel like we are positioned well for the remainder of the year, because we have in excess of 20 Bcf in the ground, and if there is some kind of weather advent or our curtailment of production in the Gulf, we are again in a good position to realize some benefit from that.
Brooke Glenn Mullin - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back to Susan Giles for any closing remarks.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you. Just as a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on the website through August the 5th. If you have any additional questions, please call me or visit us at the upcoming AGA Financial Forum. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you again for joining us. Good bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Susan Kappes Giles - VP, IR Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and CEO J. Patrick Reddy - Sr. VP and CFO Kim R. Cocklin - Sr. VP of Utility Operations
Analysts: Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Atmos Energy Fiscal 2008 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. And following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Giles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This call is open to the general public and media but designed for financial analysts, and its being webcast live over the Internet. We've placed slides on our website that summarize our financial results. We will now review those in detail but we will be happy to take any questions about them at the end of our remarks. If you would like to access the webcast and slides, please visit our website at atmosenergy.com and click on the conference call link. Also we plan to file the company's Form 10-Q later today. With me this morning are Bob Best, Chairman, President and CEO; and Pat Reddy, Senior Vice President and CFO. There are other members of our leadership team with us to assist with questions as needed. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Any forward-looking statements are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor rules of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob Best.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Susan and good morning everyone. As always we appreciate you joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. Today we are coming to your from Fort Worth, Texas where in a few hours we will hold our Annual Shareholders Meeting. I am very pleased to report to our investors listening on those calls and to those who would join us in our annual meeting and our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. As Susan mentioned, Pat Reddy, our Chief Financial Officer will review the financial result in greater detail in just a moment. But before he does I want to make a few observations about the quarter and also about recent developments regarding our company. Yesterday, we reported first quarter consolidated net income of $73.8 million, with our regulated businesses contributing 68% of that total net income. We are particularly pleased with the 26% increase in net income from the regulated gas distribution business from a year ago. The work done in our regulatory arena is yielding desired results, more stable and predictable earnings. Results from the non-regulated businesses were lower this quarter compared to a year ago, due to decline in volatility in the natural gas market. This has created fewer profit opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment, which is consistent, frankly with our view that gas margins would decline because of the gas market conditions. Also yesterday, our Board declared our 97th consecutive cash dividend. Our indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2008 is a $1.30 per share. And finally, yesterday we announced that we had submitted a pre-filing request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to construct and operate a salt-cavern gas storage project in Franklin Parish, located in Northeastern Louisiana. Because the facility will store and facilitate transportation of natural gas between states, the FERC will have regulatory oversight for the project. Project is within close proximity to 4 major pipelines, Tennessee Gas, Columbia Gulf, Regency and ANR. This is a multi-turn, high delivery... high deliverability salt-storage project, and is one of the 15 potential projects we mentioned in our December Analyst Conference. We would intend to initially create 3 Bcf caverns... three 5 Bcf caverns for a total of 15 Bcf of working gas storage with six-turn injection and withdrawal capabilities. We could potentially develop an additional 4 caverns, depending upon the market demand. We have acquired, and/or leased all necessary land at the 500-acre site. In December, we filed for an exemption from FERC to allow for the drilling of a convertible test well or re-entry of a plugged and abandoned well in order to test the salt quality as Fort Necessity. We anticipate FERC approval for this exemption at any time which will clear the way for the testing of the salt zones. The first cavern is projected to be operational by early 2011 and the other two caverns by 2012 and 2014. Our fiscal 2008 capital budget includes $50 million for this project. This storage project is in its infancy but as we get closer to the start-up date more financial metrics will be provided. I would like now to turn to the progress that we are making in Texas. In early January, we announced a tentative settlement with cities representing about half of our customer base in the Mid-Tex division. The settlement provides for the implementation of a rate review mechanism on a three-year trial basis. The rate making process established by this mechanism is essentially the same as that describe with the current GRIP program. The mechanism requires a comprehensive review of the entirety of the company's cost, revenues and investment and enables rates to be established reflecting the company's demonstrated cost of service on a prospective basis. It allows for an annual resetting of both consumption and meters. The RRM is preferable to the current truncated mechanism for revising rates because all costs and revenues are considered, not just increases in capital investment. It then should provide us with more stable and predictable revenues. The traditional truncated rate filings which are time consuming and expensive and also lethargic are all avoided. Rate adjustments occur in a comprehensive proceeding and we are annually... and are annually adjusted providing right-size adjustments rather than sticker shock amounts. The review process should also facilitate frequent collaborative meetings with customers... with our customers to discuss and describe the cost and revenue structure and capital investment to continue safe and reliable service and to encourage and support economic growth in the many communities that we serve. Other provisions of the settlement includes, moving uncollectible gas cost to the gas cost recovery mechanism in the tariff and reducing the monthly residential customer charge from $10.69 to $7 beginning October 1, 2008. The settlement also establishes a new program designed to encourage gas conservation. Each year the company and customers will each fund $1 million to the program. Funds collected from customers will be through a new customer tariff. The company is currently in discussions with the other parties in the case to try to reach a settlement. The docket pending before the Railroad Commission of Texas is scheduled to go to hearing in February 25th, for the cities that have not reached a settlement by that date. I'll now turn the program over to Pat Reddy, to review our financial results and then I'll return for some closing comments and then we'll be glad to take any of your questions that you may have. Pat?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, thank you Bob and good morning every one. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, our consolidated net income was about $74 million, or $0.82 per diluted share compared to about $81 million or $0.97 a year ago. Our regulated natural gas distribution segment reported over $40 million of net income, or a 26% increase from a year ago. This business benefited from the cumulative effect of rate design improvements and much needed rates increases as Bob mentioned. An additional $9 million of gross profit was generated as a result of rate adjustments in Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee. Our weather sensitive margin is been reduced to about 3%, resulting in more predictable earnings during our heating season. Gross profit for meter continues to grow from $82 per meter in the first quarter a year ago to $85 per meter in the current quarter. Our Regulated Transmission and Storage segment contributed almost $10 million of net income, up about 2% from the same period a year ago. This segment continues to benefit from the increased transportation in the Barnett Shale and Carthage gas producing regions of Texas. The non-regulated pipeline storage and other segments posted $3 million of net income down about 34% from this time a year ago. Earnings were... are lower mainly due to an expected decrease in unrealized margins on asset optimization activities, resulting from reduced gas price volatility that Bob mentioned. The non-regulated natural gas marketing segment reported net income of about $21 million, declining about 41% from the same period a year ago. This decline is consistent with our view at the beginning of our fiscal year that gas margins would decline along with our expectation of reduced price volatility. Since there are many components to the marketing business, let's look at gross profit for this segment. Natural gas marketing gross profit was down about $17 million from the same period a year ago, mainly due to lower volatility experienced in the gas market. Unrealized margins decreased by about $20 million mainly as a result of a smaller change in the spreads between the forward prices that are used to value our financial hedges and the market or spot price used to value our physical storage. Of course as you know these unrealized margins are temporary and should reverse in future periods as the physical gas is cycled from storage and the related financial hedges are settled. Operationally, we experienced a decrease in our delivered gas margins of almost $2 million in the current quarter compared to year ago. This was largely due to realizing lower unit margins and less volatile market compared to the prior year, offsetting this somewhat though were higher sales volumes of about 19 Bcf, reflecting the ongoing execution of our marketing strategy. We also experienced a $5 million improvement in our asset optimization margins in the current quarter. During the quarter natural gas fundamentals were less than favorable with warm weather and national gas inventory levels were nearly full. Therefore the marketing company elected to inject gas into storage and roll its financial positions forward, primarily in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, in order to take advantage of more favorable spreads. The losses incurred to settle the financial positions were smaller than in the prior year period. This positive impact was partially offset by increased storage demand fees and cycling gas in a less volatile gas market. In the process of rolling forward its storaging booking, the marketing company was able to increase the economic value associated with its storage book by almost $4 million dollars. Information concerning Atmos Energy Marketing storage book is shown in the appendix to our slide representation on slide 41 to 42. What shows the difference between the economic value which is what we use to manage the business and our GAAP reported value at the end of reporting period. As you can see there, at the end of December the excess value of our gas and storage was about $11 billion which we expect to realize primarily in our fiscal 2008 second quarter. Spreads fell to about $0.64 per Mcf at December 31, 2007 compared to a $1.32 per Mcf at the end of December 2006. As you all know Atmos Energy Marketing maintains a flat trading book and we do not engage in speculative trading. Now focusing on the expense side of our income statement, for the quarter our consolidated operation and maintenance expense rose almost $6 million. The primary drivers of the increase... increase include about $3 million due to higher labor and benefits cost, associated with annual wage increases and higher contract labor, other administrative cost as well as pipeline odorization and vehicle fuel costs, increased O&M by about $4 million. As a special offset to these increases our bad debt expense decreased to about $2 million compared to the same period a year ago, mainly due to reduce receivables resulting from lower natural gas prices in the current quarter. And interest charges in this quarter dropped about $3 million in connection with lower average short-term debt balances, versus last year. Looking at our cash flows for the quarter, we generated operating cash of about $61 million, compared with a $165 million, the same time a year ago and this difference reflects changes in various working capital items, primarily in our natural gas marketing business, along with the timing of various tax payments and receivable. Capital expenditures for the quarter were about $94 million, up $7 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting costs associated with our investment in pilot programs for automated... our automated metering initiatives in the gas distribution segment. Turning now to our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008, we are maintaining our previously announced earnings estimate for the fiscal year 2008 in the range of a $1.95 to $2.05 per diluted share of common stock. Earlier Bob discussed the tentative settlement was about half of our residential and commercial customers in the Mid-Tex division. While we are very pleased with that achievement we continue negotiations with the remaining cities, and since we are uncertain of the final outcome and timing of these negotiations, and then the timing of when we might implement the new rates, we are not assuming any material impact on our earnings in fiscal 2008. Let me discuss with you our December conference... some of our significant assumptions surrounding the guidance include normal weather, it's prescribed by the regulators in our states, while we operate without W&A or margin decoupling, continued the successful execution of our rate strategy and bad debt collection efforts, no material impact from mark-to-market of physical storage and offsetting financial hedges and those are relative to principle assumptions. We are projecting between $450 million and $465 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 of that $305 million to $315 million will be maintenance capital, and about $145 to $150 million will be gross capital. The $15 million earmarked for the gas storage project in Louisiana is already included in this estimate and there is more detail and more breakdown in our slides around our CapEx. So with that I'll turn it back to Bob.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Pat. We'll make a few closing comments and then we will be glad to, to take your questions. As Pat just reported, we are off to very good start this year and we are encouraged by our earnings report for the first quarter fiscal 2008. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2007 was 53.4% compared with 54.9% a year ago. We remain in our targeted range of 50% to 55% and we stand committed to maintaining this range. One thing we feel really good about we have realized enormous progress in our regulated operations. The gas distribution business grew as a result of effective rate making and we will continue to work on rate design to stabilize our margins, decouple recovery of margin from throughput and recover the gas costs portion of bad debt expense. This continues to be critical to the financial performance of our gas distribution segment. In the gas distribution business, we currently have rate actions filed and pending in our Kansas, Mid-Tex and Louisiana service areas and we intend to file additional cases in Virginia and Georgia in the coming months. We've talked about the proposed settlement in the Mid-Tex rate division and it's ensured in the long term smooth rate increases and avoid wild fluctuations in customer bills. While removing risk and uncertainty for the company and we think the settlements strikes a good balance between fair and acquittal treatment for our customers to company and our investors. In the regulated transmission and storage segment, the thorough system business continues to be strong with robust production continuing in the Barnett Shale and Carthage regions. In the coming months, we will be filing for 2007 capital expenditures on the Atmos pipeline Texas system through the annual GRIP filing. Our non-regulated operations will continue and have continued to complement our gas distribution business. The non-regulated natural gas marketing segment is... will provide and has provided solid earnings through more than predictable delivered gas services revenues, with some upside from the storage optimization process and business. Again as we've said in this call with lower natural gas price volatility expected for the foreseeable future, the marketing's group ability to lock-in large arbitrage spreads is going to be limited and as we also mentioned we have predicted and really have plan for that. At a consolidated level our earnings goal remains and has been in the past several years. And that is to grow our earnings per share at a rate of 4% to 6% a year on average. Through this earnings growth coupled with our dividend yield of around 4.5%, we think we offer excellent value to our shareholders. Again we are very pleased with the start of fiscal 2008, and I appreciate you taking time to be with us this morning and this concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be glad to field any questions that you may have. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we have no audio questions at this time. Actually, we just had one pop-in, it's from Ted Durban [ph] Goldman Technologies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, it's Ted Durban with Goldman Sachs. A question for you on the storage project. Maybe you just talk about when do you think you might know if it is actually a feasible project what you are drilling and what not, what the timing would be like? And then in terms of the overall supply and demand balances for gas storage in the Gulf region and may be even specifically to the geography where you are on sort of, off of the coast up in Northeastern Louisiana versus on the Coast?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well as far as the economic or when we will be able to determine if we have a project or not, the next eight months would be critical to that. We will have all kinds of activity, power market studies, and we will have test wells further geophysical staff activity. So that should, we should have a decision whether we are going move forward because we'll also have a non-binding open season, and all those will give us indications as to... as to the viability of the project. As for the need for storage in that area, our studies have indicated that there is still... although there have been some other projects announced, there is a very large need for storage because of the... a lot of the gas production coming out of Barnett Shale, Bossier Sand is going to be moving in that directions. We will be able to support some of the operations that allow those pipelines. It's very near to Perryville Hub, a lot of pipeline networks as Bob mentioned earlier and the proliferation of LNG is expected to be coming into that region will also be advantaged by additional storage. So our study seem to indicate that it is... there is a quite a bit of need at this time for that matter of that project.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then just couple of other questions on that, what are the steps in terms of getting permitting at the Federal level and the local level? How long do you think that will take? And then what kind of... just high level returns, might you be looking for on return-on-capital or what not?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I can speak to the timing of the permitting and there is quite a few milestones that will take place, I guess. But we just received word that we did, get the FERC... did give us an exemption to proceed with a test well that will be number one. We will be performing that and aligning the drilling of that well so that we can have a core sample submitted to the Department of Natural Resources in Louisiana. But I guess longer term with a lot of... we'll have a lot of interim milestones. But we expect that we would be able to receive a FERC approval to develop this project probably, January, February, timeframe of 09. As far as economics I don't believe we are at that stage where we can begin to start putting those out.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay good. And then just last question actually on the Mid-Tex settlement. Is there any concern of that your increasing your volume metric risk at all, since your reducing, I guess usually customer charges going from $10.69 to $7 is that... is there any sort of offset in terms of decoupling or you actually increasing your volumetric crisis there?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Ted, well I think, Kim Cocklin is here who runs our regulated business we will let him address that.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Utility Operations: There is no risk economically to the recovery, because we have reset the charges based on the consumption and the meter counts in each, each year that we established new rate with the RRM mechanism.
Unidentified Analyst: [Multiple Speakers]
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Utility Operations: But it's a bonus to the customer, because they are paying a lot of base charge but we will continue to collect the same revenue.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, thank you.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Ted.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we do have question from the line of Faisel Khan, with Citigroup, please go ahead.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: It is actually Barry Klein.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Hi Barry.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Hey, how is it going.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Great.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Two questions, one was with regards to regulated transmission and storage, the increase was about $5 million from the last quarter. I guess relating primarily to the GRIP filing associated. Can you remind us how much that will be for the year?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On an annualized basis?
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Yes. Is that just... is it $5 million a quarter, for the four quarters.
Kim R. Cocklin - Senior Vice President of Utility Operations: I think last year's filing was $13.2 million.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And of course its kind of front loaded in the heating season but...
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: So we shouldn't see much of this over the rest of the year.
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In the second quarter you will see probably the bulk of the balance.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay. So about $5 million to $10 million... about $8 million you are saying in the second quarter?
J. Patrick Reddy - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: $8 million in the balance of the year and a good portion of that in the second quarter. And again of course that depends on the pipelines throughput in the summer, whether it's a hot summer or cooler summer and they have probably five or six other ways to collect revenues for things like park and loan. And so it's not as simple as just the heating season that I would say at least half of that would be in the second quarter.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay, thanks. And can you just give us a little bit more color surrounding the FERC investigation and I guess what are the potential outcomes?
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the FERC of course is as we have mentioned in our filings, we have submitted data to the FERC and we are still waiting. We haven't really at this point, no idea exactly, when they will get back to us. Also they are all looking at a notice of proposed rule making which we think would help clarify some of the rules around issues relating to the matters that they had submitted data to us or so. We are somewhat uncertain at this point about when any action we would be taken and we will just keep you posted as we know something.
Barry Klein - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay, thanks a lot.
Robert W. Best - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time there are no additional questions. I will turn it back to management for any closing remarks.
Susan Kappes Giles - Vice President, Investor Relations: Well, thank you all, this is Susan. Just as a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website till May the 2nd and if you have any additional questions of course you can always call me. We appreciate your interest in Atmos and thank you for joining us. Bye, bye.
Operator: You may now disconnect.
